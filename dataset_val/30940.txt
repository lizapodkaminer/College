Our franchisees are fully insured members of professional bodies supported by specialist software who know their local rental market and manage all properties locally.
Estate Agency We operate on a no sale no fee basis.
We cater both for the majority of sellers who prefer to instruct an agent operating from high street premises and for the growing segment of sellers who choose to use an agent without a high street office.
Two of our brands have been engaged in estate agency for more than 150 years.
How we do it We rely on the motive power of local people who are committed to operating franchises under our brands to the highest levels of professionalism and service.
Our brands are household names in their local communities regions and nationally.
Whilst the majority of franchisees operate through high street offices and have been with us for many years a growing number of new franchisees choose to offer a 247 online service though
Our success We are a multiaward winning group with recent successes including gold for EweMove for best franchise estate agency at the Sunday Times awards in 2016 and silver for best franchise at the 2017 Negotiator awards.
Just as importantly we have grown the revenue of our network of franchises through joint effort and support year on year since 2005.
Where we focus The Group has a strong presence in lettings and currently manages 52000 properties on behalf of landlords which amounts to a town the size of
It also has a growing presence in estate agency.

Its network has grown again this year with the addition of 6 further offices 12 in the last 2 years.
Ellis and Co has 19 high street offices 18 within London.
It shares complimentary branding with Martin and Co offices in London and the two brands with a combined strength of 42 offices work together to serve London.

CJ Hole was established in 1867.
An award winning brand with strong local brand heritage operated through 19 high street offices in Avon Somerset and Gloucestershire.
Martin and Co was established in 1986 and has 186 high street offices serving England Wales and Scotland with offices from Falmouth to Aberdeen.
It is one of the major residential letting agents in the UK with over 37000 properties under management deriving 87% of its management service fees from lettings services.
A multiaward winning agency it specialises in residential lettings property management property investment and sales.
Lettings and investor sales brand Hybrid estate agency brand Balanced mix of sales and lettings Driving innovation for 40 years Delivering exceptional service for 70 years Serving customers for over 150 years Serving London since 1850 Launched in late 2013 EweMove has rapidly grown to a network of 120 franchises at the year end.
The EweMove franchise model combines the recruitment of local property experts LPEs typically serving micro territories of 20000 households through a centralised 247 technology platform with the traditional features of a full estate agency service and a consumer fee predicated on completed sales rather than listings.
It has been the UKs No 1 Most Trusted Agent on Trustpilot since 2016.
Lettings national lettings focus
The Property Franchise Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strong progress despite market headwinds All of our brands increased revenues yearonyear.
This growth was supported by the assisted acquisitions programme  which assisted our lettings agents both operationally and financially to purchase independent competitors lettings businesses.
In the first full year of the programme we added 2012 tenanted managed properties.
Im delighted to report that this was matched by an almost identical increase in our managed portfolio through organic growth.
Tenant fee ban The Government has provided a degree of clarity on its intention to ban tenant fees in England and Wales.
A ban in Scotland has been in existence since 2012.
The intention appears to be an outright ban rather than a cap on landlords and their letting agents charging any type of pretenancy fee.
Its not clear whether certain intenancy fees will be allowed.
The timing of the implementation of the ban appears to be Q1 2019 which means that the Groups trading for 2018 would be unaffected by the ban.
The Group is already taking action to mitigate the effects of the ban which is expected to put at risk 16% of our franchisees lettings revenue and at a Group level 9% of total revenue if annualised.
Mitigation factors include through organic means and by acquisition accelerating the size of the tenanted managed portfolio developing income from financial services and conveyancing referrals.
The Group will continue to closely monitor any developments associated with the Tenant Fee Ban and the associated potential impact.
Brand website redevelopment One of our objectives when we purchased EweMove was to translate some of its digital marketing capabilities into better performance for our traditional brands.
During
2017 we redeveloped each of our five traditional brand websites starting with Whitegates.
Although the technology platform is common the look and feel of each site is different to reflect the heritage and values of the particular brand.
There is divergence on functionality with Whitegates embracing all of the tried and tested EweMove concepts such as web pages optimised for lead conversion Google payperclick live chat downloadable property valuations and functionality to book a valuation appointment.
Overall the website project generated nearly 17000 new business leads at an average cost to our franchisees of 24 per lead.
The Board believes that the new websites delivered a competitive advantage in H2 2017.
Name change On 16 March 2017 the Company changed its name from MartinCo PLC to The Property Franchise Group PLC.
It was time to recognise the transformation from a single franchisor to a multifranchisor of residential agents.
Outlook
The Groups intention is to be wellpositioned for all eventualities and developments in the estate agency and letting agency space.
Despite the market challenges the Group delivered another strong set of results in this its fourth full year on AIM.
My thanks go to the executives their teams and my fellow Board members for their outstanding efforts over the last year.
I am delighted to announce that the Board has recommended an increased final dividend of 5.4p per ordinary share for 2017.
Richard Martin
The Property Franchise Group PLC Both percentages quoted based on 2017 trading.
The consensus view of the residential property market was that 2017 was a disappointing year compared to 2016.
However 2017 was a strong year of growth for The Property Franchise Group demonstrating the resilience of its business model in a challenging market.

Investment case 06 The Property Franchise Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Benefits of a genuine multibrand strategy in a changing industry landscape After our acquisition of Xperience Franchising and Whitegates in 2014 we focused on consolidation driving out duplicate costs and leveraging economies of scale.
By 2016 we had reaped the fruits of that approach the combined businesses delivered 1.0m of after tax earnings against a net cash consideration of 5.1m.
However EweMove is a very different proposition.
It is a fullyfunctioning franchisor with its own proprietary technology EweReka sitting on an industrial scale platform.
Its HQ staff are based in Cleckheaton Bradford and culturally it is very different from our traditional high street brands.
Consequently our intention was always to keep EweMove separate from our existing brands and benefit from some of its digital marketing expertise without needing to fold it into our traditional support infrastructure.
The key to success with EweMove is to drive the numbers of local representatives to continue to recruit franchisees at current levels to encourage more experienced estate agents to join the brand and to reduce its franchisee attrition rate.
EweMove incurred losses in H1 trading.
However with the departure of the founders at the end of June 2017 and the arrival of the new Managing Director the business returned to profit in H2 trading and pleasingly the number of franchises rose to 120 by year end.
The online or hybrid space is very topical in the property industry.
It has been estimated that circa 250m has been raised by our competitors since they launched with a number of the top players becoming increasingly high profile.
Unlike those companies where the customer proposition is focused on saving commission EweMoves promise is above all to get the customers property sold.
However
EweMove does share several characteristics with the bestknown brands it is nationally recognised does not rely on high street offices and operates 247 for customer convenience.
A genuine multibrand strategy is more than just a collection of brands.
EweMove shows the clarity of our thinking as it gives us an exciting play in the online hybrid space and hedges against deterioration in trading conditions for our traditional high street model.
We have crystallised the price we paid for EweMove which is relatively modest compared to the sums invested in competing businesses and have management in place to see us through the next growth phase.
As well as progressing with EweMove we achieved satisfying network revenue growth at all of our traditional brands Whitegates leading with 14% CJ Hole 9% Parkers 6% Martin and Co 5% and Ellis and Co 3%.
In 2017 we concentrated on further development of the six property brands which we already own continuing to build upon our genuine multibrand strategy which sees us invested in competing businesses.
An important part of this was to recruit a new brand leadership team to see us through the next growth phase which we achieved this year.

Chief Executive Officer
Chief Executives statement 07 The Property Franchise Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Governance Financial statements Strategic report Growing and developing our hybrid network EweMove provides estate agency and lettings services 247 through an integrated platform and a franchised network of local property experts.
Change
2017 saw the active recruitment of experienced estate agents for the first time 15 recruited.
At the midyear Nick Neill took the helm as MD following the founders departure.
Nick was one of the first franchisees and was running one of the most successful franchises.
Not all franchisees accepted the changes but the flow of new franchisees attracted by the technology and ethos continued.
Progress
We have focused on the core activities refining what worked and creating operational efficiencies.
Losses in H1 were significantly offset by profits in H2 net loss 0.1m.
Renewed vigour saw the franchise network increase to 120 franchises by year end.
The 2 key areas of focus moving ahead are accelerated growth in the national footprint of local property experts and enhancing franchise performance.
Number of franchises 25% 2016 96 These figures are not quoted on a likeforlike basis.
In all 178 traditional brand offices grew their revenue yearonyear and 105 offices had static or shrinking revenue.
We had 3 franchisees managing 800 properties 21 franchisees managing 500 and 59 franchisees managing 300.
The overall pattern was of pleasing revenue growth in a marketplace where many competitors were reportedly in reverse gear.
However we cannot be complacent.
Whilst our best franchisees made good progress other franchisees found trading conditions difficult.
Management are alive to the possibility that there will be both opportunities for our franchisees to act as consolidators at their local level buying up competitors letting portfolios but there will also be consolidation opportunities within the Group with strong and capable franchisees buying out their weaker neighbours.

Financial position The balance sheet remains strong with total assets of 20m 2016 20m and a reduction of 2.5m in liabilities during the year.
This reduction in liabilities was due to repayments of bank debt totaling 0.9m a 2.2m reduction in deferred consideration as a result of the settlement reached with the founders of EweMove an increase in tax payable of 0.4m partly due to increased profitability but also due to lower tax deductions for options exercised and an increase in other payables of 0.2m of which deferred income accounted for 0.1m.
The Group finished the year with the total equity attributable to owners of 14.3m an increase of 2.1m or 17% over FY16.

The majority of rental properties are bought wholly from cash resources.
Cash buyers now account for 34% of all house purchases and 45% of all sums spent on house purchases.
They and first time buyers are forecast to be the growth drivers of residential property purchases over the next 5 years.
Pension reform Pension reform has enabled the over 55s to access retirement funds which can be used to purchase outright or as a deposit on a buytolet property.
Its forecast that this group will be responsible for 3 million property deals.
Larger pension pots are being used to create regular incomes.
Far fewer annuities are being purchased.
Property deals Buytolet mortgage availability An additional 721 products were introduced into the UK buytolet market during 2017 representing a 32% rise in overall product availability to 2959.
Low interest rates and longer terms continue to stimulate demand with Q3 2017 showing 2% growth over Q3 2016.
Evidence suggests buytolet mortgage activity may have accounted for 6% of all market transactions in 2017.
Buytolet mortgage products A high performing asset class Independent research we commissioned showed the total returns from buytolet as an asset class ranged from 6.4% to 13.2% per annum depending on the region over the 10 years to 2014.
Such yields are still available the top 25 postcodes returning 7.3% to 12.63%.
Recent research show average returns of 6.1% in the UK.
Return pa 5% 12% Net migration remains high Net migration for the year to September 2017 was 244000 against a prior year of 273000.
The level of net migration is similar to early 2014.
In 4 years to September 2017 net migration has totaled The foreignborn UK population has lower home ownership rates and is almost 3 times as likely to be in the private rented sector.
Year to September 2017
Whilst property remains a fundamentally safe asset class the uncertainty about what Brexit means for individual households wealth is making UK buyers more cautious.
Despite this UK house sales of 1.2m have been a consistent theme over the last 4 years.
The market is proving more resilient than some commentators thought.

In England alone 25% or 5.6 million of all households are forecast to be privately renting by 2021.
Privately rented homes Increased regulation The Government is trying to professionalise the property rental sector.
One way has been increasing regulation on landlords.
Deposits must be registered new health and safety rules for rented homes checks on a tenants right to rent in the UK landlord licensing and EPCs for rented properties.
These changes favour agents.
Multiple brands Five of our brands have an established track record.
We believe each of these is capable of further expansion  witness the growth in Whitegates to 46 offices from 34 in 2015.
The sixth EweMove has grown rapidly in 4 years to 120 franchises at the year end.
Its micro territory model technology and appeal to new franchisees means it may well have the highest number of franchisees of any of our brands within a few years.
Brands
Fragmented market There are estimated to be 25560 estate agents and possibly nearly as many letting agents operating in the UK.
Less than a dozen have more than 100 offices.
19% of estate agents are showing signs of financial insolvency and the tenant fee ban will put similar pressures on letting agents.
Consolidation opportunities exist.
Estate agents Rise of franchising There are now 5 listed property franchisors with over almost 1000 offices between them.
The combination of corporate infrastructure to support highly incentivised individual ownermanagers trading under a recognised brand name has proven to be a powerful one.

Our franchisees are members of professional bodies.
They have all received training from us and have access to continuing professional development.
Franchisees live locally to their businesses and manage all properties locally.
They are supported by specialist operational software to responsibly deliver a professional lettings service.

Our role is to provide the infrastructure opportunities support and stimulus for growth.
EweMove
EweMove operates a hybrid agency franchise system.
A franchise owner has all the benefits of 247 technology and customer support at his fingertips without the need for high street premises.
As in Martin and Co the majority of franchise owners have no prior experience of our sector.
Having spent 30 years growing Martin and Co we know that development support is essential in the early years of a franchises life.
We immediately transferred in 2 experienced development managers followed by a trainer and now run intensive boot camps.
With aspirations to be a national sales brand we need national representation and listings.
We have seen what good sales agency looks like through the acquisition of
So we decided to change the recruitment drive to actively recruit estate agents.
In 2017 from a standing start half our recruits were experienced estate agents.
As expected they quickly won instructions and thereby spread experienceawareness of the brand.
A fear existed that the brand would no longer be so highly rated for customer service through this change but to date EweMove remains the No 1 most trusted estate agent on Trustpilot.
One change more than any has altered the landscape.
In having to appoint a new MD a process in which many suitable candidates presented themselves from our sector our franchisees have one of their most successful franchisees in charge Nick Neill.
Traditional Brands Our brands have long established histories that we and our franchise owners are rightly proud of.
Many independent agents have come and gone through the economic cycles but these brands have survived and prospered.
They operate in a sector which has been slow to recognise the impacts of changing customer requirements and to take advantage of new technology and digital marketing.
EweMove showed us that you can generate leads through pay per click PPC relatively cheaply and of course we had access to their partner.
To progress PPC it meant recruiting a marketing director with the necessary skills and experience which we achieved at the halfyear.
It meant developing new websites which we completed in 2017.
It meant persuading national marketing committees to back PPC which they did.
The brands websites went live between May and December 2017.
In this time period they delivered a 294% increase in website conversion rates a 730% increase in the PPC conversion rate 16622 PPC enquiries were generated and there was an 88% reduction in the cost per lead.
Acquisitions
For the last few years we have been explaining the tangible benefits of acquiring portfolios of managed properties and independent agents businesses to our franchisees with the help of those franchisees who have followed that path.
Market pressures imply that there may be more independent operators of lettings and sales businesses looking to exit our sector.
So we decided to increase our efforts in this area at the start of 2017 including incentivising franchisees with cash back and financial support for office rebranding.
Assisting franchisees with acquisitions brings together many functions in the franchisor to help with valuing the business the legal process due diligence funding and integration but it also requires support from our partners.
As we were looking to increase our activity we supplemented our internal resources and we retained the services of one of the most experienced acquisition managers in our sector.
In 2017 we achieved a 253% increase in the number of managed properties acquired by our franchisees.
They acquired 2012 managed properties.
With a franchise you get the benefit of an established brand and ongoing training.

The Property Franchise Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Acquisition success for our franchises in Plymouth and Leicester When an opportunity arose to purchase one of the citys most established agents we absolutely jumped at it Chris and Merolyn Whitaker Franchise Owner
Husband and wife team Chris and Merolyn Whitaker joined The Property Franchise Group in 2015 following 16 years serving in the Armys Intelligence Corps.
Just 2 years later the couple completed on one of the networks largest ever single office acquisitions.
How did the journey start Having made the decision to take the plunge and purchase a property business we took the first steps and agreed on location.
We had existing roots in the South West and with Plymouth the largest city in the UK without a Martin and Co presence at the time we were naturally eager to secure the territory and we did.
How The Property Franchise Group helped Our role was to capitalise on the enthusiasm and drive by supporting the launch of their franchise as efficiently and effectively as we could.
We have a tried and tested launch plan.
At the core of everything is the need to win those first instructions and then keep the momentum going which we did with regular contact and visits.
It did not stop there in 2017 having set their sights on expansion an opportunity arose to buy a successful competitor in
They could grow their presence their team and their skill base so as to be able to offer a comprehensive lettings and sales service of scale.
The timing was right as the Group had resourced up to facilitate such ambition.
Our acquisitions consultant liaised with the broker and negotiated on the sale price.
Then we helped define and refine a deal structure that worked for all parties.
Further assistance was supplied in the form of due diligence work legal support with a complicated structure and finally the handover by the seller.
Result
Two years later Chris and Merolyn had moved their franchise up to 8th by income in the Martin and Co network.
Income had quadrupled the number of managed properties had increased 650% and their sales business was showing signs of good growth.
We would never have got to where we are now if it wasnt for those around us supporting our every step and guiding us in the right direction.
The support of other Martin and Co franchisees across the whole network has been  and remains invaluable.
Everyone is in exactly the same boat and we have benefited hugely from the continual sharing of ideas and experiences along our entire journey to date.
The encouragement acknowledgement and inspiration we receive from our peers has been instrumental to our success.
Case study Plymouth 19 The Property Franchise Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Governance Financial statements Strategic report Acquiring Taylors an agency with such heritage in my local area was a perfect fit for my existing business and it was a significant investment.
Mitul Gadhia Franchise Owner
Mitul Gadhia demonstrated his entrepreneurial spirit at an early age when upon moving to Leicestershire in his late teens he soon started to invest in property  and had very quickly developed his own portfolio with properties across the length and breadth of the UK.
How did the journey start So Mituls journey as a business owner began when he opened the doors to his Martin and Co office in Loughborough in 2012  becoming one of The Property Franchise Groups youngest ever franchisees.
In August 2017 still in his mid20s Mitul purchased one of Leicestershires most wellestablished estate and lettings agencies consisting of 5 offices across Leicester and Loughborough with a plan to trade under the Whitegates brand.
How The Property Franchise Group helped Mitul was supported throughout by us.
A core aspect was our assistance with his business plan for the enlarged group of offices under his ownership which included analysis of how the local markets traded and how to optimise coverage to retain and win business by our Head of Business
Postacquisition we assisted with helping to define roles and responsibilities for staff commission schemes the setting of targets and the systems.
Result
This move saw Mitul become the Groups largest franchisee in terms of office numbers with a total of 8 to his name.
Not only did the purchase see me acquire a portfolio of 480 managed properties but it saw my team grow by an additional 35 members of staff  all of whom were brought into the existing operation under the Whitegates brand.
And if this phenomenal success wasnt enough Mitul is also proud to have a number of industry accolades to his name including the title of Young Achiever in the Business and Enterprise category of the Leicester Mercury Awards and silver winner of Rising Star of the Year award at the 2015 Negotiator awards.
Leicester 20 The Property Franchise Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Principal risks and uncertainties Effective management with regular reviews evaluations and prioritising of risks The Board considers that the risks detailed below represent the key risks to achieving the Groups strategy and objectives.
There could be additional risks and uncertainties which are not known to the Board and there are risks and uncertainties which are currently deemed to be less material which may adversely impact on the achievement of the Groups strategy and objectives.
Risk area Potential impact No guarantee of growth There is no certainty that the Group will be successful in executing its strategy for growth.
Our network of existing franchisees needs to grow its revenue on average at 7% or more to achieve our growth plan.
EweMove may not achieve sufficient franchisee recruitment or fail to win sufficient instructions.
Reduced growth in Management Service Fees.
Reduced market share and representation.
Poor or no profit growth from the franchise model.
Market conditions The residential property market is influenced by economic and political factors on a regular basis.
The outcomes of both Brexit and Government policyintervention in the housing market are uncertain.
This can cause shortterm changes in the behaviour of our clients and longterm changes in the way our sector develops.
The sales market is forecast to decline slightly in 2018.
A series of government measures may hamper growth in the lettings sector.
As a result franchisees income may reduce or grow more slowly with a knockon effect on the Groups income from Management Service
Competition for property portfolios The Group plans to expand by finding and buying portfolios in partnership with franchisees.
We are not the only franchisor in our sector pursuing this strategy and we also face competition from wellknown estate agents.
We may not be able to secure acquisitions at the values that meet our criteria.
We may not be able to secure the external resource to assist us leaving senior management spending more time than intended on finding and completing acquisitions.
We pay more for acquisitions than we would have ideally intended to.
Our payback period increases.
Reduced operating profit from acquired portfolios.
Ability to find recruit retain and scale up skilled franchisees An inability of the Group to attract new franchisees with the necessary skills expertise and resources to purchase resales of existing territories and cold start in new territories.
Existing franchisees decide to scale back.
Slower growth through inability to increase market representation or a decline in market representation.
Not achieving the uplift in revenue seen in the first year of a resale.
Lower franchise resale fees.
Reputational risk to our brand A strong brand is key to being successful in the sector as it is for many other sectors and central to that is the reputation of the Group and its franchisees.
As you grow there is an increased chance of the actions of one franchisee causing greater damage to the Group.
Failure by the franchisees to meet the expectations of landlords and tenants or to fall short of the standards set by the Group may have a material impact on reputation.
Loss of landlords and inability to recruit new franchisees.

The Property Franchise Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Independent auditors report to the members of The Property Franchise Group PLC
We have audited the financial statements of The Property Franchise Group PLC the parent company and its subsidiaries the group for the year ended 31 December 2017 which comprise of the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income Consolidated statement of financial position Company statement of financial position Consolidated statement of changes in equity Company statement of changes in equity Consolidated statement of cash flows Company statement of cash flows and notes to the financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as regards to the parent company financial statements as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2016.
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the groups and the parent companys affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the groups profit for the year then ended the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing UK ISAs UK and applicable law.
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.
We are independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK including the FRCs Ethical Standard as applied to SME listed entities and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to going concern We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs UK require us to report to you where the directors use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate or the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the groups or the parent companys ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that in our professional judgment were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement whether or not due to fraud we identified including those which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Goodwill and intangible assets
The Group has completed a number of acquisitions the most significant of which was in relation to Ewemove Sales and Lettings LTD in September 2016.
The recoverability of the goodwill and other intangibles arising on these acquisitions is dependent on the future performance of the cash generating units to which the goodwill and other intangibles are allocated.
Due to the significant management judgement in forecasting the cash flows and selecting an appropriate discount rate there is a high level of estimation uncertainty which results in there being a significant risk associated with determining whether goodwill andor other intangibles are impaired.
As a result of its value in use calculations the group has impaired the master franchise agreements held in intangible assets by 500k.
Refer to note 16 to the financial statements for the disclosures relating to the goodwill and other intangibles and the related impairment calculations.
Our response Our audit procedures included testing of the discounted cash flow model including the split of forecast cash generation between the separable intangibles challenging the judgements and assumptions used by management in the calculation and performing sensitivity analysis on the cash flow model.
We considered the historical accuracy of key assumptions by comparing the accuracy of the previous estimates of profitability and related cash flows to the actual amounts realised.
We assessed managements sensitivity of key assumptions including the revenue growth forecasts and the discount rate and considered whether the disclosures about the sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment assessment to reasonably possible changes in key assumptions were adequate and properly reflected the risks inherent in the valuation of goodwill and other intangibles.
We audited managements impairment of the master franchise agreements held in intangible assets consulting with our valuations expert and challenging the assumptions and basis of impairment charge.
We have also audited managements estimation of the useful life of intangible assets acquired on business combinations and the revisions made in respect of these.
Our application of materiality When establishing our overall audit strategy we set certain thresholds which help us to determine the nature timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effects of misstatements both individually and on the financial statements as a whole.
During planning we determined a magnitude of uncorrected misstatements that we judge would be material for the financial statements as a whole FSM.
During planning FSM was calculated as 242000 which was updated to 316000 during our audit work.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all unadjusted differences in excess of 5000 as well as differences below those thresholds that in our view warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
The Property Franchise Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Financial statements Governance An overview of the scope of our audit Our audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its control environment including Groupwide controls and assessing the risks of material misstatement.
The financial statements were audited on a consolidated basis using Group materiality.
The scope of our audit covered 100% of both consolidated profit before tax and consolidated net assets.
Other information The directors are responsible for the other information.
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report other than the financial statements and our auditors report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements our responsibility is to read the other information and in doing so consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information.
If based on the work we have performed we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 In our opinion based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements and the Strategic Report and the Directors Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Directors Report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if in our opinion adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us or the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns or certain disclosures of directors remuneration specified by law are not made or we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of directors As explained more fully in the directors responsibilities statement set out on page 27 the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements the directors are responsible for assessing the groups and the parent companys ability to continue as a going concern disclosing as applicable matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditors report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs UK will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if individually or in the aggregate they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Councils website at httpwww. rc. iteauditorsresponsibilities.
This description forms part of our auditors report.
This report is made solely to the companys members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the companys members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors report and for no other purpose.
To the fullest extent permitted by law we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the companys members as a body for our audit work for this report or for the opinions we have formed.

The
Group operates in the UK.
The Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the UK and listed on AIM.
The address of its head office and registered office is 2 St Stephens Court St Stephens Road Bournemouth Dorset UK.
Basis of preparation These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in note 5.
The presentational currency of the financial statements is in British pounds and amounts are rounded to the nearest pound.
Going Concern The Group has produced detailed budgets projections and cash flow forecasts.
The Directors have concluded after reviewing these budgets projections and forecasts making appropriate enquiries of the business and having considered uncertainties under the current economic environment that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly they have adopted the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
New standards amendments and interpretations issued The following new or amended standards are mandatory for the first time for the period beginning 1 January 2017 Standard Key requirements Effective date Amendments to IAS 7 Disclosure initiatives 1 January 2017 Amendments to IAS 12 Recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses 1 January 2017 Amendments to IFRS 12 Disclosure of interests in other entities 1 January 2017 The following relevant new standards amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued but are not effective for the financial year beginning on 1 January 2017 and endorsed by the European Union and have not been early adopted Standard Key requirements Effective date as adopted by the EU IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2018 IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers 1 January 2018 Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification and measurement of sharebased payments 1 January 2018 IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9 will supersede IAS 39 in its entirety and is effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2018.
Any changes to recognition and measurement will be applied retrospectively by adjusting the opening balance sheet at that time.
The core areas addressed within IFRS 9 are as follows Classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities.
Impairment of financial assets.
Hedge accounting.
The Group does not expect any material changes in relation to the classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities nor the impairment of financial assets nor for hedge accounting.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 will be effective for the Group from 1 January 2018 replacing IAS 18 Revenue IAS 11 Construction contracts and related interpretations.
Any changes to the recognition and measurement will be applied retrospectively by adjusting the opening balance sheet at that time.
The standard establishes a principlesbased approach for revenue recognition and is based on the concept of recognising revenue for obligations only when they are satisfied and the control of goods and services is transferred.
It applies to all contracts with customers except those in the scope of other standards.
Notes to the consolidated and Company financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 44 The Property Franchise Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Basis of preparation continued The Group has performed an assessment which has highlighted that the new standard will impact on franchise sales revenue recognition but not Management Service Fee recognition or the recognition of other income.
Franchise sales revenue currently consists of 4 elements A fee to buy a new franchise territory which is recognised upon the earlier of receipt of funds or signing of the franchise agreement.
A fee to buy a franchise territory that is being sold through the exit of the current franchisee which is recognised upon the earlier of receipt of funds or signing of the franchise agreement.
A fee paid by the seller of the franchise which is recognised in the month that a contract for the resale of a franchise is signed.
A fee paid upfront by franchisees for the first 12 months use of its systems which is deferred and released over the first 12 months as the obligations are discharged.
For the fees described at points 1 and 2 above the franchisors have some initial obligations that extend beyond the receipt of funds and the signing of a franchise agreement.
It is likely that some of the revenue will be deferred and released as the Group discharges its initial obligations to new franchisees including the provision of training and initial support.
Current estimates are that the period of release will be between 1 to 4 months with the majority released by month 2.
From the work performed to date the Group believes that the adoption of IFRS 15 will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 requires that almost all leases will be brought onto lessees balance sheets under a single model except leases of less than 12 months and leases of lowvalue assets eliminating the distinction between operating and finance leases.
The Directors anticipate that IFRS 16 will be adopted in the Groups consolidated financial statements when it becomes mandatory.
Currently the Group holds some noncancellable operating leases but no finance leases.
For the Groups noncancellable operating lease commitments of 0.1m as at 31 December 2017 note 25 a preliminary assessment indicates that these arrangements will continue to meet the definition of a lease under IFRS 16.
Thus the Group will have to recognise a rightofuse asset and a corresponding liability in respect of all these leases  unless they qualify for lowvalue or shortterm leases upon the application of IFRS 16.
The Group believes that the adoption of IFRS 16 will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented unless otherwise stated.
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements include those of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries drawn up to 31 December 2017.
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control.
The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations.
The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
Acquisitionrelated costs are expensed as incurred.
Intercompany transactions balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated.
When necessary amounts reported by subsidiaries have been adjusted to conform to the Groups accounting policies.
Significant accounting policies Revenue recognition Revenue represents income net of VAT from the sale of franchise agreements resale fees and management service fees levied to franchisees monthly based on their turnover and other income being the provision of training and ongoing support to franchisees.
Traditional brands Fees from the sale of franchise agreements are not refundable and are recognised upon the earlier of the receipt of funds or the signing of the franchise agreement.
These fees are for the use of the brand along with initial training and support and promotion during the opening phase of the new office.
Resale fees are recognised in the month that a contract for the resale of a franchise is signed.
Management service fees are recognised on a monthly basis and other income is recognised when the training and support is provided to the franchisee.
EweMove Fees from the sale of franchise agreements for the EweMove brand are treated differently to the other brands because an element of the initial fee is deferred and released over the first 12 months of trading of the franchise where no monthly license fees are payable.
Management service fees consist of monthly license fees and completion fees.
License fees are recognised on a monthly basis completion fees are recognised when sales or lettings transactions complete and other income is recognised when the training and support is provided to the franchisee.
Notes to the consolidated and Company financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 continued 45 The Property Franchise Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Governance Financial statements Strategic report Operating profit Profit from operations is stated before finance income finance costs and tax expense.
Business combinations On the acquisition of a business fair values are attributed to the identifiable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities unless the fair value cannot be measured reliably in which case the value is subsumed into goodwill.
Where the fair values of acquired contingent liabilities cannot be measured reliably the assumed contingent liability is not recognised but is disclosed in the same manner as other contingent liabilities.
Goodwill is the difference between the fair value of the consideration and the fair value of identifiable assets acquired.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and subject to an impairment review both annually and when there is an indication that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Intangible assets Intangible assets with a finite life are carried at cost less amortisation and any impairment losses.
Intangible assets represent items which meet the recognition criteria of IAS 38 in that it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the assets will flow to the entity and the cost can be measured reliably.
In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations an intangible asset acquired in a business combination is deemed to have a cost to the Group of its fair value at the acquisition date.
The fair value of the intangible asset reflects market expectations about the probability that the future economic benefits embodied in the asset will flow to the Group.
Amortisation charges are included in administrative expenses in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Amortisation begins when the intangible asset is first available for use and is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost of each intangible asset over its expected useful life on a straight line basis as follows Brands  CJ Hole Parkers Ellis and Co Indefinite life Brands  EweMove 21 years Customer lists including cashback 5 years Master franchise agreements  Whitegates CJ Hole Parkers Ellis and Co 25 years Master franchise agreements  EweMove 15 years Technology  EweReka 5 years Technology  Websites 3 years Acquired trade names are identified as separate intangible assets where they can be reliably measured by valuation of future cash flows.
The trade names CJ Hole Parkers and Ellis and Co are assessed as having indefinite lives due to their long trading histories.
Acquired customer lists are identified as a separate intangible asset as they are separable and can be reliably measured by valuation of future cash flows.
This valuation also assesses the life of the particular relationship.
The life of the relationship is assessed annually.
Cashback given to franchisees who have made an eligible acquisition is capitalised as an intangible asset and amortised over 5 years being the typical length of a franchise agreement.
Customer lists are being written off over a remaining life of 5 years.
Acquired master franchise agreements are identified as a separate intangible asset as they are separable and can be reliably measured by valuation of future cash flows.
The life of the relationship is assessed annually.
Master franchise agreements are being written off over a remaining life of 1525 years as historical analyses shows that on average 4%10% of franchises will change ownership per annum.
The cost of the new brand websites launched in 2017 have been capitalised and are being amortised over 3 years from launch date being the expected period over which the websites are expected to generate economic benefit.
Subsequent to initial recognition intangible assets are stated at deemed cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment charges.
Impairment of nonfinancial assets The carrying amounts of the Groups noncurrent assets are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
If any such indication exists the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
In respect of goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful lives management are required to assess whether the recoverable amount of each exceeds their respective carrying values at the end of each accounting period.
In respect of intangible assets with definite lives management are required to assess whether the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value where an indicator of impairment exists at the end of each accounting period.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
The Property Franchise Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Significant accounting policies continued Impairment losses represent the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount they are recognised in profit or loss.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cash generating unit and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a prorata basis.
Where an indicator of impairment exists against a definite life asset and a subsequent valuation determines there to be impairment the intangible asset to which it relates is impaired by the amount determined.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined net of depreciation or amortisation if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Investment in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are stated in the Parent Companys balance sheet at cost less any provisions for impairments.
Property plant and equipment Items of property plant and equipment are stated at cost of acquisition less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets over their estimated useful lives on the following bases Fixtures fittings and office equipment 15% reducing balance Computer equipment over 3 years Short leasehold improvements over the lease term Income taxes Income tax currently payable is calculated using the tax rates in force or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Taxable profit differs from accounting profit either because some income and expenses are never taxable or deductible or because the time pattern that they are taxable or deductible differs between tax law and their accounting treatment.
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in profit or loss except if it arises from transactions or events that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Deferred tax Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences at the tax rate that is substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is generally provided on the difference between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
However deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of goodwill nor on the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless the related transaction is a business combination or affects tax or accounting profit.
Tax losses available to be carried forward as well as other income tax credits to the Group are assessed for recognition as deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full with no discounting.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that the underlying deductible temporary differences will be able to be offset against future taxable income.
Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at tax rates that are expected to apply to their respective period of realisation provided they are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in the income statement.
For share based payments the deferred tax credit is recognised in the income statement to the extent that it offsets the share based charge with any remaining element after offset being shown in the statement of changes in equity.
Operating lease commitments Rentals applicable to operating leases where substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership remain with the lessor are charged to profitloss on a straightline basis over the period of the lease.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash balances in hand and in the bank including shortterm cash deposits.
Financial assets The Group and Company only have financial assets classified as loans and receivables.
The loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
Cash and cash equivalents which exclude any client account monies include cash in hand and deposits held at call with banks.
Impairment of financial assets Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence such as significant financial difficulties on the part of the counterparty or default or significant delay in payment that the Group will be unable to collect all of the amounts due under the terms receivable the amount of such a provision being the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future expected cash flows associated with the impaired receivable.
For trade receivables and loans to franchisees which are reported net of provisions such provisions are recorded in a separate provision account with the loss being recognised within other operating costs in the income statement.
On confirmation that the trade receivable will not be collectable the gross carrying value of the asset is written off against the associated provision.
Notes to the consolidated and Company financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 continued 47 The Property Franchise Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Governance Financial statements Strategic report Loans and receivables These assets are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They arise principally through the provision of services to franchisees eg. asset.
They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to their acquisition or issue and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method less provision for impairment.
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence such as significant financial difficulties on the part of the counterparty or default or significant delay in payment that the Group will be unable to collect all of the amounts due under the terms of the receivable the amount of such a provision being the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future expected cash flows associated with the impaired receivable.
For trade receivables which are reported net such provisions are recorded in a separate allowance account with the loss being recognised within administrative expenses in the income statement.
On confirmation that the trade receivable will not be collectable the gross carrying value of the asset is written off against the associated provision.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are comprised of trade and other payables borrowings and other shortterm monetary liabilities which are recognised at amortised cost.
Trade payables other payables and other shortterm monetary liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down.
In this case the fee is deferred until the drawdown occurs.
To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates.
Sharebased payments The Company issues equitysettled sharebased payments to employees.
Equitysettled sharebased payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equitysettled sharebased payments are amortised through the consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the vesting period of the options together with a corresponding increase in equity based upon the Companys estimate of the shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured using the BlackScholes option pricing model taking into account the following inputs the exercise price of the option the life of the option the market price on the date of the grant of the option the expected volatility of the share price the dividends expected on the shares and the riskfree interest rate for the life of the option.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted based on managements best estimate for the effects of nontransferability exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
At the end of each reporting period the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the nonmarket conditions and recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates if any in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Deferred consideration A provision is recognised in the Statement of Financial Position when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pretax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and where appropriate the risks specific to the liability.
The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised in finance costs.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty The Company makes certain estimates and assumptions regarding the future.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
In the future actual experience may differ from these estimates and assumptions.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
The Property Franchise Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Impairment of intangible assets The Group is required to test where indicators of impairment exist whether intangibles assets have suffered any impairment.
The recoverable amount is determined based on value in use calculations.
The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows and the choice of a discount rate in order to calculate the present value of the cash flows.
Key assumptions for the value in use calculation are described in note 16.
The result of these calculations was that for EweMove whilst the value in use exceeded the carrying value of the intangible assets it had reduced by 0.5m over the original calculation at acquisition.
This reduction was traced to a reduction in the value in use of the master franchise agreement.
Accordingly an impairment of 0.5m was made against the carrying value of the master franchise agreement of EweMove.
Valuation of separable intangibles on acquisition When valuing the intangibles acquired in a business combination management estimate the expected future cash flows from the asset and choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
Separable intangibles valued on acquisitions made in year were nil 2016 5.2m as detailed further in note 16.
Sharebased payment charge The aggregate fair value expense of each grant is determined through using the BlackScholes model detailed above and an estimate for the attainment of the nonmarket based performance condition in FY19.
The estimate of earnings per share the nonmarket based performance measure relies on the assumptions regarding the achievement of the current years budget and a projection of earnings for FY19 taking into account available market data and performance trends.
At this juncture its estimated that 26.5% of the nonmarket based performance condition will be met.
Segmental reporting The Board of Directors as the chief operating decisionmaking body review financial information for and make decisions about the Groups overall franchising business and have identified a single operating segment that of property franchising.
Revenue
The Directors believe there to be three material income streams relevant to property franchising which are split as follows Management Service Fee 8281238 6874542 Franchise sales 569857 412448 Other 1318901 1014385 10169996 8301375 All revenue is earned in the UK and no customer represents greater than 10% of total revenue in either of the years reported.
Other revenue relates to training and ongoing support to franchisees.
Administrative expenses Administrative expenses relate to those expenses that are not directly attributable to any specific sales activity.
Administrative expenses for the year were as follows Employee costs see note 9 2704417 2392050 Marketing and digital costs 592931 436855 Property costs 134315 110659 General administrative costs 1284078 951805 Amortisation 616793 326030 5332534 4217399 Employees and Directors Average numbers of employees including Directors employed during the year Group Companytel 2016 Administration 39 35 Management Notes to the consolidated and Company financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 continued 49 The Property Franchise Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Governance Financial statements Strategic report Employee costs including Directors during the year amounted to Group Company Wages and salaries 2403067 2132615 424581 367898 Social security costs 289756 249988 45062 34964 Pension costs 11594 9447 1328 1382 2704417 2392050 470971 404244 Sharebased payments charge 137020  110619 Exceptional costs arising through redundancy  105347 Key management personnel are defined as Directors and executives of the Group.

The sharebased payments charge for the current year has been charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income of this 110452 relates to Directors.
In the prior year as it was immaterial no charge was made to the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Exceptional items The net exceptional income in the year ended 31 December 2017 of 701463 all relates to EweMove.
It consists of the reduction in deferred consideration payable of 1179146 and the associated unwinding of discounting on deferred consideration in the year see note 12 and an impairment charge of 500000 against the master franchise agreement following a revaluation due to evidence suggesting that the businesss value may have been impaired see note 5.
The exceptional costs in the year ended 31 December 2016 consist of 149598 acquisition costs for EweMove and 105347 redundancy costs as a result of restructuring the Group.

The remaining option over 64800 ordinary shares was exercisable at 31 December 2017 but the average share price during the year ended 31 December 2017 was below the exercise price.
For these reasons in 2017 there is no dilutive effect of share options on the earnings per share calculation.
In 2016 all options outstanding at 31 December 2016 had met their vesting conditions therefore there was a dilutive effect of all share options on the earnings per share calculation.

The Property Franchise Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Business combinations acquired October 2014 Goodwill is assessed for impairment by comparing the carrying value to the value in use calculations.
The value in use of the goodwill arising on the acquisitions of Xperience Franchising Limited XFL  and Whitegates Estate Agency Limited WEAL  is based on the cash flows derived from the actual revenues and operating margins for 2017 and projections through to 31 December 2019.
Thereafter projected revenue growth was assumed to decline linearly to a longterm growth rate of 2.2%.
The cash flows arising were discounted by the weighted average cost of capital which included a small companies risk premium to allow for factors such as illiquidity in the shares.
These discount rates were 13.5% for XFL and 15.0% for WEAL the latter higher rate reflecting WEALs smaller size and more volatile earnings.
This resulted in a total value for each company of the identifiable intangibles assets that exceeded the carrying values of the respective companies goodwill.
The Directors do not consider goodwill to be impaired.
The Directors believe that no reasonably possible change in assumptions at the year end will cause the value in use to fall below the carrying value and hence impair the goodwill.
The master franchise agreements are being amortised over 25 years.
The period of amortisation remaining at 31 December 2017 was 21 years 10 months.
The brand names under which XFL trades of C J Hole Parkers and Ellis and Co have been in existence for between 70 years and 168 years.
Management see them as strong brands with significant future value and has deemed them to have indefinite useful lives as there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the assets are expected to generate net cash inflows for the Group.
As a consequence management annually assess whether the carrying value of these brands have been impaired.
The RelieffromRoyaltyMethod was used to value the brand names.
Looking at independent research of royalty rates management selected pretax royalty rates of between 3% and 5% for the above brand names.
The after tax royalty rates were then applied to the projected cash flows of each brand.
The projected cash flows being the forecast growth in current revenues using market data through to 31 December 2019.
Thereafter projected revenue growth was assumed to decline linearly to a longterm growth rate of 2.2%.
The after tax cash flows determined through this process were then discounted at 13.5% to determine a value for each brand name.
This discount rate approximated the companys WACC as the risk profile of the brand names was seen as commensurate with that of the overall company.
The values derived exceeded their carrying values.
The Directors believe that no reasonably possible change in assumptions at the year end will cause the value in use of the brands names CJ Hole Parkers and Ellis and Co to fall below their carrying values and hence impair their intangible values.
The Whitegates brand was valued in a similar manner and deemed to have an immaterial value when the acquisition was made principally due to its lack of profitability over preceding years.
It is therefore not recognised separately.
Business combination acquired September 2016 Goodwill is assessed for impairment by comparing the carrying value to the value in use calculations.
The value in use of the goodwill arising on the acquisition of EweMove Sales and Lettings Ltd ESL  is based on the cash flows derived from the actual revenues and operating margins for 2017 and projections through to 31 December 2024.
Thereafter projected revenue growth was assumed to 2.2% per annum.
A period of projected cash flows exceeding 5 years was deemed appropriate because the business has only been operating for 4 years is continuing to recruit relatively high levels of new franchisees each new franchisee should grow significantly in the first 5 years of operation and it has yet to develop the operational efficiencies of a mature franchisor.
Various events since acquisition notably the founders deciding to leave the business the decision to actively recruit experienced estate agents and the decision to change the licence fee have caused a higher than originally projected attrition rate of franchisees who existed at acquisition.
There has also been more development support required for franchisees without experience of the sector than was originally expected.
As a result the business failed to achieve the projected EBITDA of 0.8m achieved negative EBITDA of 0.1m.
The revenue growth rates used in the valuation have been reduced and now range from 47% in FY18 to 5% in FY24.
The cash flows arising were discounted by the weighted average cost of capital being 16.39% which included a small companies risk premium to allow for factors such as illiquidity in the shares.
This resulted in the value in use exceeding the carrying value of the goodwill and separately identifiable intangible assets.
However the calculations did indicate that the enterprises overall value had reduced by 0.5m compared to the value at acquisition.
The above events and the reduction in the enterprises value suggested that the value of the master franchise agreement may have reduced.
A revaluation was performed.
This used the a. b. projections of operating margin until 2024 where thereafter they remain unaltered.
As these revenue streams represent the return from all the assets employed in generating those revenues the fair value and expected rate of return of these other assets known as the contributory asset charge was determined and deducted.
A discount rate of 16.39% was then applied.
Notes to the consolidated and Company financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 continued 53 The Property Franchise Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Governance Financial statements Strategic report The resulting value of the master franchise agreement was 0.5m lower than the carrying value.
As a result an impairment of 0.5m has been charged to the master franchise agreements carrying value.
The recent attrition rate of franchisees existing at acquisition implies that the remaining useful life of the master franchise agreement may be shorter than that originally assumed of 21 years.
For this reason the remaining useful life of the master franchise agreement has been reduced to 15 years.
The period of amortisation remaining at 31 December 2017 was 13 years 8 months.
The remaining useful life of the brand name was also reviewed.
It continues to attract and recruit the same level of franchisees as in previous years and to attract higher numbers of customers.
Given these 2 factors the remaining useful life of the brand was considered to be unaltered at 21 years.
The period of amortisation remaining at 31 December 2017 was 19 years and 8 months.
The following table reflects the level of movements required in revenue or costs which could result in a potential impairment per the value in use calculation of goodwill.
A further percentage fallincrease of the magnitude indicated in the table below in any one of the key assumptions set out above would result in a removal of the headroom in the valueinuse calculation for goodwill in 2017.
Thus if the discount rate increased by more than 14.5% to above 18.77% an impairment change would result against goodwill all other assumptions remaining unchanged.
Assumption Judgement Sensitivity Discount rate As indicated above the rate used is 16.39% 14.5% Revenue  FY18 to FY24 The range of growth rates for FY18 to FY24 are stated above 18% Direct costs  all years Assumed to be 31% of revenue for all years 20% Indirect costs  all years Assumed to be 46% of revenue in FY18 and then decline linearly to 29% of revenue in FY25 onwards 20% Direct and indirect costs  all years As indicated above for direct and indirect costs 10% Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets have been allocated for impairment testing purposes to the following cashgenerating units.
The carrying values are as follows Goodwill Brands Xperience Franchising Limited 912716 912716 571000 571000 Whitegates Estate Agency Limited 400501 400501 Martin and Co UK Limited 75000 75000 EweMove Sales and Lettings Ltd 5837943 5837943 7226160 7226160 571000 571000 Website Costs included in Technology In 2017 new websites were launched for each of the 5 traditional brands.
The costs associated with these websites have been capitalised as intangible assets as the purpose of the websites is to generate leads and revenue for the network.
Cashback included in Customer lists The additions in customer lists in 2017 represent sums provided to franchisees that have made qualifying acquisitions to grow their lettings portfolios.
The sum provided is based on a calculation of the estimated increase in MSF as a result of the acquisition.
In providing these sums the Group ensures that franchisees are contractually bound to the relevant franchisor for a period in excess of that required for the economic benefits to exceed the sums provided.

This transaction was in 2013 and accounted for in accordance with the principles of merger accounting.
The consideration paid to the shareholders of the Subsidiary was 17990000 the value of the investment.
As these shares had a nominal value of 179900 the merger reserve in the Company is 17810100.
On consolidation the investment value of 17990000 is eliminated so that the nominal value of the shares remaining is 179900 and as there is a difference between the Company value of the investment and the nominal value of the shares purchased in the Subsidiary of 100 this is also eliminated to generate a merger reserve in the Group of 179800.
Sharebased payment reserve The sharebased payments reserve comprises charges made to the income statement in respect of sharebased payments and related deferred tax impacts under the Groups equity compensation scheme.

General objectives policies and processes The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Groups risk management objectives and policies and whilst retaining ultimate responsibility for them it has delegated the authority for designing and operating processes that ensure the effective implementation of the objectives and policies to the finance function.
The Board receives monthly reports from the finance function through which it reviews the effectiveness of the processes put in place and the appropriateness of the objectives and policies it sets.
The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the Groups competitiveness and flexibility.
Further details regarding these policies are set out below Capital management policy The Board considers capital to be the carrying amount of equity and debt.
Its capital objective is to maintain a strong and efficient capital base to support the Groups strategic objectives provide progressive returns for shareholders and safeguard the Groups status as a going concern.
The principal financial risks faced by the Group are liquidity risk and interest rate risk.
The Directors review and agree policies for managing each of these risks.
These policies remain unchanged from previous years.
The Board monitors a broad range of financial metrics including growth in MSF operating margin EBITDA return on capital employed and balance sheet gearing.
It manages the capital structure and makes changes in light of changes in economic conditions.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure it may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a franchisee or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
It is Group policy to assess the credit risk of new franchisees before entering contracts and to obtain credit information during the franchise agreement to highlight potential credit risks.
The highest risk exposure is in relation to loans to franchises and their ability to service their debt.
The Directors have established a credit policy under which each franchisees are analysed for creditworthiness before a loan is offered.
The Groups review includes external ratings when available and in some cases bank references.
The Group does not consider that it currently has significant concentration of credit risk with loans extended to franchisees of 20k.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk arises from the Groups management of working capital and the finance charges and principal repayments on its debt instruments.
It is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
In order to maintain liquidity to ensure that sufficient funds are available for ongoing operations and future development the Group monitors forecast cash inflows and outflows on a monthly basis.
Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to changes in interest rate risk relates primarily to interest earning financial assets and interest bearing financial liabilities.
Interest rate risk is managed by the Group on an ongoing basis with the primary objective of limiting the effect of an adverse movement in interest rates.
Hence the fixed rate of interest on one of its two bank loans.
If LIBOR increased by 1% this would cost the Group an extra 15k in interest for a full year.
The Directors monitor movements in interest rates and believe that any reasonable fluctuation in LIBOR would not have a material impact on the Group.
Fair values of financial instruments The fair value of financial assets and liabilities is considered the same as the carrying values.

The following principal assumptions were used in the valuation of each of the grants made in the year ended 31 December 2017 using the BlackScholes option pricing model Assumptions EMI  A EMI  B EMI  C Date of vesting 30042020 30042020 30042020 Share price at grant 1.615 1.620 1.285 Exercise price 0.01 0.01 0.01 Riskfree rate 0.17% 0.32% 0.34% Dividend yield 4.02% 4.01% 5.06% Expected life 2.89 years 2.78 years 2.63 years Share price volatility 28.60% 29.00% 29.00% The weighted average contractual life remaining of these options is 2 years and 4 months.
Expected volatility is a measure of the amount by which a share price is expected to fluctuate during a period.
The assumptions used in valuing each grant are based on the daily historical volatility of the share price over a period commensurate with the expected term assumption.
The riskfree rate of return is the implied yield at the date of grant for a zero coupon UK government bond with a remaining term equal to the expected term of the options.
Its expected that with an exercise price of 0.01 should the EPS condition be met all holders will exercise as soon as the options vest.
The
Group announces its results usually within the first 10 days of April.
So it has been assumed that all options will be exercised on 30 April 2020.
