Flybe needed a new way forward and a different culture Since the start of the turnaround in 2013 much has been achieved.
However the market remains highly competitive and the results of the turnaround need to be assessed against this background. routes.
We compete with all forms of transport  road rail and ferry  as well as other airlines with 18.9% of our routes having a direct airline competitor.
Consumer demand has continued to be fragile subdued by tragic events in Paris in November 2015 and brussels in March 2016 and then by uncertainty arising from the brexit vote in June 2016.
Despite this backdrop our continued growth in fleet size the result of an aircraft order placed at the time of the IPo in 2010 forced us to grow the route network with new routes being launched principally to utilise the aircraft we had. and yields. different culture.
As the historic aircraft order works its way out this Summer will see the size of the fleet peak.
From the Autumn the fleet will reduce in number as six endoflease handbacks will be returned to lessors. customerorientated. our strategy. change.
We need to listen more to our customers and importantly listen to our own employees who work with customers every day.
Communication needs to flow up the organisation from customers and employees as much as flow down from senior executives.
Flybe needed a new way forward and a different culture.
Given that Flybe was entering a new phase in its development we agreed that it was time for a new Chief executive o fficer to lead the Company.
Saad Hammad stepped down and left the business by mutual consent in o ctober last year. executive Chairman. the role of Ceo .
Christine brings a lifelong experience in aviation having started her career in the maintenance department of Air France with a Masters degree in aeronautical engineering.
She progressed in Air France later Air France Kl M with stints in It  sales and marketing as well as general management in both the u K and uSA culminating in being Ceo of CityJet both as a subsidiary of Air France Kl M and later as an independent private company.

We are very pleased to have attracted such a talented executive to lead our business.
Christine has made a very strong start to her Flybe career and gives her perspective on Flybe later in this report. other modes of transport.
We agree that penalties for excessive flight delays within an airlines control are an important protection for passengers but believe that compensation needs to have some relationship to the value of the ticket price and not be as is currently the case for regional airlines often three times the ticket price or more.
No such punitive regime exists for rail road and ferry operators nor indeed for long haul airlines.
Regional aviation is a critical part of this countrys infrastructure.
Simon Laffin Nonexecutive Chairman is followed.
Culture
High standards of corporate governance play an important role in achieving organisational excellence and in setting the right culture.
Leadership
A small high quality and wellbalanced board to provide effective leadership and vision.
Communication
Consulting with stakeholders on key issues like remuneration.
Committees
An established committee structure to assist the board discharge its responsibilities Audit Committee  review of the effectiveness of internal controls financial reporting and risk management.

A typical domestic flight can be charged up to 19 times the tax per mile of a longhaul one. charge only once.
Scottish National Party has promised to halve the cost it has not as yet announced the rate structure.
Four times more business in Scotland is conducted with the rest of the u K than europe and more than 80% of visitors to Scotland are from Great britain so reducing domestic ADt rates would produce significant benefits for the Scottish economy.
Flybe earns just under 30% of its revenue from Scottish routes and would be keen if ADt were reduced to introduce new routes and more rotations to serve more Scottish customers.
Regional aviation is a critical part of this countrys infrastructure.
Many business trips are not practical by road or rail due to their slowness.
Growing tourism in the u K requires fast reliable regional connectivity.
Margins are very tight in regional aviation for both airports and airlines as our results amply demonstrate so raising distortive charges does not help either businesses or consumers. domestic routes. government will have to play its part in this.
We have recently started routes from Aberdeen and edinburgh into l ondon Heathrow offering more choice and lower fares but the economics of even these popular domestic routes are tough.
Results
Revenue grew by 13.4% this year compared to 8.7% last year.
With the growing fleet commitments in difficult market conditions Flybe showed an adjusted loss before tax of 6.7m 201516 5.5m adjusted profit excluding u SD loan revaluation losses of 13.2 201516 2.8m. tax was 19.9m 201516 profit of 2.7m.
We finished the year with net debt of 64.0m and total cash of 124.3m 2016 net funds 62.2m and cash of 171.4m.
General outlook t he board wishes to create the best european regional airline with an earnings stream that is resilient to consumer downturns and delivers value to our shareholders. t he general economic conditions remain difficult.
We are as ever exposed to exogenous events that can disrupt regional air travel.
With new leadership and impetus we shall continue to drive costs lower and improve the profitability of our route network.
Flybe plays a vital role in u K regional connectivity. focused culture and control over our own fleet size. profitable growth in the future.
Simon Laffin Nonexecutive Chairman th June 2017 to predict.
In the worst case if there is no agreement between the u K and the eu  this would mean that we may no longer be able to fly between the u K and Continental europe.
We are currently assuming that there will be a deal to ensure that we remain a full member of the european safety body eASA in the interest of maintaining common safety and operating standards.
We have however now discontinued all our intra european routes and the situation remains unclear on our codeshare and White l abel arrangements as well as any regulatory and supply chain impacts on the FAS operations.
It is difficult to plan as a business when the regulatory environment is so uncertain.
However the predominance of our business in u K domestic routes provides some protection.
Board
Aside from the change to our Ceo  discussed earlier there were no other changes to the board during 201617.
As announced on 18 th April 2017 Philip de Klerk will leave us at the end of September 2017 primarily for personal reasons.
We very much wish Philip well for the future and would like to thank him for his sterling work over the last three years. recruitment process for his successor is well underway.

Passenger revenue per seat 50.64 1516 48.84 1617 51.35 1415
During 201617 we have seen a 3.6% reduction in passenger revenue per seat as our capacity grew 12.3% in a competitive marketplace.
We managed to maintain our yield which measures our passenger yield per sold seat at 70.20 201516 70.23.
Goal
Our goal is for yearonyear improvement in passenger revenue per seat now that we are in control of our fleet and capacity.
Load factor l oad factor is measured as sold seats as a percentage of available seat capacity.
Load factor 72.6% 1516 75.2% 1415 69.6% 1617 competition within the market.
Goal r aising load factor is a key driver to improve passenger revenue per seat.
Our s ustainable business improvement Plan aims to deliver a 75% load factor.
Reliability
A key enabler for operational excellence is the reliability of our fleet. without a technical fault.
Reliability
98.8% 1516 98.6% 1415 99.0% 1617
Investment in reliability modifications for the Q400 has contributed to an improvement in our technical despatch reliability to 99.0% across our fleet.
Goal
Our business plan includes further improvements to improve reliability above 99.0%.
Ontime performance A key measure for our customers is ontime performance measured as the percentage of flights which arrive within 15 minutes of their scheduled arrival time.
Ontime performance 85.4% 1516 84.5% 1415 82.7% 1617
We have seen a significant reduction of our ontime performance due to various reasons including weather technical issues and French air traffic control strikes.
Despite this reduction Flybe was named as the best u K airline for punctuality by o AG in January 2017 placing us sixth worldwide.
Goal
We will continue to improve our ontime performance in order to achieve our goal of operational excellence.
Total passenger revenue t otal passenger revenue is ticket revenue plus ancillary revenues.
Total passenger revenue 571.7m 1516 528.6m 1415 619.3m 1617
During 201617 the increase in sold passenger numbers resulted in an increase in passenger revenue of 8.3%. in capacity.

Net fundsdebt 62.2m Mar 16 64.0m Mar 17 76.7m Mar 15 Cost reduction We measure our cost reduction effectiveness by tracking unit cost performance via two cost per seat indicators.
We use two indicators to measure each of these.
Performance t otal cash has reduced due to capital expenditure on fleet during the financial year with net debt increasing due to the debt financing of aircraft acquisitions in 201617.
Goal
Maintaining and generating cash is a priority for f lybe alongside reducing debt to give a more favourable net debt and ultimately net funds position.
Cost per seat including fuel Cost per seat excluding fuel Due to the proportion of our costs that are driven by fuel we therefore measure cost per seat including fuel and also excluding fuel.
We also look at the impact of currency through application of constant currency rates.
Performance
Cost per seat including fuel has increased by 2.0% however on a constant currency basis it reduced by 5.2%.
White l abel business adds costs which are included in the cost per seat calculation whereas the additional seats are excluded from the seats which is adversely impacting the cost per seat.
Fuel costs fell by 3.6% due to falling fuel prices offsetting higher costs associated with increased sectors flown.
Cost per seat excluding fuel has increased by 5.5% however on a constant currency basis it reduced by 0.6%.
Goal f lybe will continue to focus on cost reduction across all cost lines as well as optimising the use of its resources.

Simon Laffin returned to his n onexecutive role on 20 th January 2017.
It was appreciated that combining the roles of the c hairman and ceo is not in line with governance best practice paragraph A.2.1 of the c ode but it was believed to be in the best interests of the c ompany to have the interim period overseen by someone who was already very familiar with the company and could therefore act as a caretaker for the period until a new ceo was appointed.
Diversity
All recruitment for the Board is led by the n omination committee.
There has been the appointment of a new c hief executive o fficer this year and now a third of the c ompanys directors are women.

Board recognises that diversity in its widest sense is important for the Boards effectiveness.
All the directors have been appointed on merit alone and specifically for the contributions that are brought from their knowledge and experience.
Their wideranging experience and backgrounds ensure that they can debate matters in relation to both the development of strategy and performance against the objectives set by the Board.
We believe that the diverse backgrounds of the individual directors ensure we have a Board with the optimum combination of skills and experience needed to support the business.
As a result no targets have been established for the composition of the Board whether in terms of racial background or gender.

Flybe Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 201617 Flybe Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 201617 77 Review of the Annual Report The committee examined at the request of the Board the Annual Report to determine whether it was fair balanced and understandable.
The committee did this by gaining an understanding of the drafting and preparation process and the level of review and challenge introduced to ensure balance and accuracy.
After its review of the process consideration of management and auditor papers on the financial statements and the Annual Report and its own review of the Annual Report the Audit committee concluded that the Annual Report was fair balanced and understandable and recommended that the Board approve it on those terms.
Review of business risk and its reporting in the financial statements The principal risks and uncertainties facing the business are discussed on pages 36 to 41.
The Board has responsibility for determining the nature and extent of the risks it is willing to take in achieving its strategic objectives and for oversight of the risk management process.
Flybe has used the experience gained over many years to develop structures and processes to identify evaluate manage and report on the significant risks faced by the Group.
These structures and processes which are embedded within Flybes operations have been in place throughout the year and up to the date of approval of this Annual
The Board is satisfied that these structures and processes ensure that risks are adequately and appropriately addressed and corrective actions taken.
A process of Risk Management SelfAssessment has been introduced where management responsible for the risk report on the effectiveness and operation of mitigating controls.
Risks are formally selfassessed on a quarterly basis.
This in addition to Risk Assessment workshops and regular reviews and updates by the Board and Audit c ommittee ensure a robust framework of risk management is maintained.
The purpose of these workshops has been to review enterprisewide the likely risks to business objectives so that the Board can update its understanding of how well risks are understood and managed.
The findings are recorded in a risk register along with their potential impact the mitigations and controls currently in place and recommendations where possible for risk reduction.
The Audit c ommittee and the Board review the risk register at halfyear and yearend and will do so more frequently if necessary.
The principal risks identified are robustly assessed by the committee and any issues are challenged back to management through the Head of Internal Audit and Risk.
In addition to the work of this c ommittee the Safety and Security committee chaired by an independent n onexecutive Director meets at least quarterly to review the Groups safety performance.
Risks identified The committee assesses whether suitable accounting policies have been adopted and whether management have made appropriate estimates and judgements.
The committee reviews accounting papers prepared by management which provide details on the main financial reporting judgements at both the half and full years.
The c ommittee also reviews reports by the external auditor on the halfyear and fullyear results which highlight any issues that have arisen as a result of their work.
Regarding the financial statements the committee considered the following significant issues The basis for the writeoff of intangible assets totalling 4.3m plus 0.5m of accelerated amortisation on an identified group of intangible assets where the useful economic life has been reduced due to the planned implementation of a digital platform How Flybe should account for its deferred tax position.
Advice has been sought on this and recommendations were made in relation to the governing rule in IAS 12 Hedging conditions for both fuel and currency reviewing the fundamentals of the accounting of such hedges under IFRS 9 Future impacts to the financial statements on the forthcoming adoption of IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 see note 2 and Maintenance provisions have been reviewed and remain unchanged.

The committee approved the annual Internal Audit and Risk plan designed to provide effective riskbased coverage over the internal control environment for the coming year.
The Audit c ommittee has made the decision to cosource the Internal Audit and Risk Management function which is currently performed inhouse.
It is felt that external providers will provide access to specialists use best practices and offer resource flexibility.
They will be truly independent and will have tools processes and people specialised in the Internal Audit and
Risk Management functions.
With the risk profile of Flybe and the limited number of qualified resources it seemed an opportune point to proceed with this strategy.
This will be implemented during 201718.

It is standard practice for the external auditor to meet privately with the Audit c ommittee without any member of management or the executive directors being present.
This practice is made available at each of the Audit committee meetings and is considered a standing agenda item.
As a result of its reviews the Audit c ommittee was able to recommend the reappointment of Deloitte LLp to the Board.

The external auditor provides some nonaudit services primarily advice on corporate transactions that may arise from time to time.
In 201617 the external auditor has also provided advice to the c ompany in relation to the triennial valuation of the defined benefit pension scheme.
In order to ensure that auditor objectivity and independence are safeguarded the following controls have been implemented A formal policy on the use of the external auditor for nonaudit work has been agreed by the Audit committee and is available on the companys website at siterporategovernance.
In summary this ensures that usually such work is only awarded when by virtue of the auditors knowledge skills or experience the external auditor is clearly to be preferred over alternative suppliers.
Any fees charged by the Groups external auditor in respect of nonaudit services over a set cumulative value of currently more than 50000 require the prior approval of the Audit c ommittee.
Under the policy the external auditor is specifically excluded from providing any work that may impair their independence and from providing internal audit services to Flybe.
The Audit c ommittee receives and reviews each year an analysis of all nonaudit work awarded to the external auditor over the financial period.
A breakdown of the fees paid to the Groups external auditor during the year is set out in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements and further detail is highlighted in the Audit fees nonaudit services section of this report.
The Audit c ommittee receives each year a report from the external auditor as to any matters that the external auditor considers have or may have bearing on its independence and which need to be disclosed to the Audit c ommittee.
The Audit c ommittee is satisfied that notwithstanding non audit work Deloitte LLp have retained objectivity and independence during the year.
The Audit c ommittee will continue to monitor its policy in this regard and accepts that nonaudit work should be controlled to ensure that it does not compromise the independence of the external auditor.
We believe the independence and objectivity of the external auditor and the effectiveness of the audit process are safeguarded and remain strong.
Auditor rotation Deloitte LLp audited the Annual Report and accounts for the first time for the year ended March 2007 and as a plc for the year ended March 2011.
Under eU audit reform legislation companies are required to have a mandatory rotation of auditors after 10 years from listing or 20 years if there is a compulsory retender at 10 years.

March 2017 Saad Hammad  7001 7001 philip de Klerk  7001  7001 Recruitment awards Saad Hammads recruitment award As part of his remuneration arrangements on joining Flybe Saad Hammad received an award under the one off LTIp which provided him with an entitlement to a cash payment based on the incremental growth in Flybes market capitalisation over a threeyear period commencing on 1 st August 2013.
Under the terms of his award Saad Hammad was entitled to a cash sum equivalent to a fixed percentage of the incremental increase in market capitalisation between 1 st August 2013 and 31 st July 2016.
Starting and ending market capitalisations for Flybe were based on a threemonth average market capitalisation to the relevant date.
Saad Hammad was entitled to receive a 4% share of any incremental increase in market capitalisation if the ending market capitalisation was 150m or less.
If the ending market capitalisation was greater than 150m Saad Hammad was entitled to receive 4% of the incremental increase between the starting market capitalisation and 150m and a 3% share of any incremental increase in market capitalisation above the 150m threshold.
As disclosed in the prospectus released on 20 th February 2014 in connection to the proposed Firm placing and placing and o pen o ffer the committee further agreed that the ending market capitalisation should be reduced by the value of the aggregate subscription price paid for any new shares in the capital of the c ompany which were issued after the date that the ceo joined the c ompany but on or before the end of the performance period.
Accordingly 156m was deducted from the ending market capitalisation relating to the fundraising completed in March 2014.
Directors remuneration continued To the extent the award vested at the end of the three year performance period 50% of the award was to be released after three years with the remainder released after further deferral periods of six months 25% of the award and 12 months 25% of the award.
Having assessed performance against the targets applicable to this award the committee determined that no portion of this award vested resulting in the entire award lapsing.
Philip de Klerks recruitment award philip de Klerk was granted a phantom option under the cashbased LTIp on 22 nd August 2014 over 705096 notional shares with an opening price of 1.2126.
This award vests on the third anniversary of grant provided that the closing price i. of grant is at least 1.6126.

The proposed performance measures will reflect the approach adopted last year i. to a number of performance indicators.

Furthermore no portion of the personal strategic bonus will normally be payable unless there is a positive adjusted pBT following the payment of bonuses.
Given the competitive nature of the c ompanys sector the specific performance targets are considered to be commercially sensitive and accordingly are not disclosed.
Following the conclusion of the current financial year the committee intends to adopt the same level of retrospective disclosure of bonus targets as has been applied in previous years.

Flybe Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 201617 Flybe Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 201617 91 PSP awards It is proposed that a pSp award be granted to c hristine o urmieresWidener in the forthcoming year over shares worth 150% of salary.
As was the case with awards made last year the performance measures for these awards will be based on adjusted epS and TSR growth summarised as follows Adjusted epS for 201920 50% weighting % of that part of the award that vests 11.1p or more 100% Between 11.1p and 7.4p prorata on straightline basis between 100% and 0% 7.4p 0% Threeyear TSR 50% weighting relative to the constituents as at st April prior to grant of the FTSe Smallc ap excluding investment trusts % of that part of the award that vests Upper quartile or more 100% Between upper quartile and median prorata on straightline basis between 100% and 20% Median 20% Below median 0% performance conditions will be measured over three financial years to 31 st March 2020.
The epS condition looks at the epS achieved in the final year only based on the reported adjusted epS subject to such adjustments as the c ommittee considers appropriate and the TSR condition compares the TSR over the three months prior to the start of the financial year in which the grant is made with the three months prior to the end of the financial year ending three years later.
In addition an underpin applies under which the c ommittee can scale back vesting to zero if considered appropriate in the event that there has been an aviation safety event that it considers warrants the use of such discretion.
To the extent that awards vest a holding period applies such that 50% of the shares are receivable immediately with the balance receivable in two equal tranches on the fourth and fifth anniversaries of grant.
The c ommittee is mindful of the fact that the epS target range is lower in absolute terms than the 12.9p15.9p target range employed for the 201617 grant which was also lower than the 18.5p22.2p range used in the 2015 grant.
However the committee believes that the 7.4p11.1p target range is entirely appropriate and reflects tough market conditions and lower internal and external forecasts for growth making it no less challenging for management than the targets employed for past awards.
Based on the current capital structure and tax rates the full vesting epS of 11.1p is consistent with an adjusted i. c hristines evolving senior management team.
Making a further round of pSp grants with stretching but potentially achievable targets will be a crucial element in this.
As stated above c hristine will be awarded shares worth 150% of her salary i.
201617 award.
The c ommittee does not think it appropriate to reduce the value of c hristines award to reflect the lower epS targets as the performance conditions applying to the 201617 awards were set prior to c hristine joining Flybe.
However to reflect the lower targets the committee has retained the vesting schedule that was applied to the epS element of awards last year of 0% vesting at threshold as opposed to the more common 25%20% threshold vesting used by other companies and by Flybe for the 201516 awards.
In addition the fact that c hristines package is lower in overall terms than Saad Hammads is evidence of the prudent approach the committee is taking to remuneration at Flybe.

Where maximum amounts for elements of remuneration have been set within the directors remuneration policy these will operate simply as caps and are not indicative of any aspiration.
Travel and hospitality While the c ommittee does not consider these to form part of benefits in the normal usage of that term we have been advised that corporate hospitality whether paid for by the company or another and product familiarisation through staffbusiness travel for directors and exceptionally their families may technically come within the applicable rules and so the c ommittee expressly reserves the right for the c ommittee to authorise such activities within its agreed policies.

Approach to recruitment remuneration The companys Recruitment Remuneration p olicy which is set out below aims to give the committee sufficient flexibility to secure the appointment and promotion of high calibre executives to strengthen the management team and secure the skill sets to deliver our strategic aims.
In terms of the principles for setting a package for a new executive Director the starting point for the committee will be to apply the general policy for executive Directors as set out above and structure a package in accordance with that policy. these caps in practice.
Where a new appointees salary is initially set below market the c ommittee may manage salary progression in a phased manner over a number of years subject to the individuals development in the role.
The Annual Bonus plan and pSp will operate including the maximum award levels as detailed in the general policy in relation to any newly appointed executive
Any recruitmentrelated pSp awards which are not buyouts will be subject to the relevant plan terms including performance conditions and limits as stated in the general policy.
Details of any recruitment related awards will be appropriately disclosed.
For an internal appointment any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may either continue on its original terms or be adjusted to reflect the new appointment as appropriate.
For external and internal appointments the committee may agree that the c ompany will meet certain relocation expenses as it considers appropriate.
For any buyouts the c ompany will not pay more than is in the view of the c ommittee necessary and will in all cases seek in the first instance to deliver any such awards under the terms of the companys existing incentive arrangements.
It may however be necessary in some cases to make buyout awards on terms that are more bespoke than the existing arrangements.
All buyouts whether under the companys existing incentive arrangements or otherwise will take account of the service obligations and performance requirements for any remuneration relinquished by the individual when leaving a previous employer.
The c ommittee will seek to make buyouts subject to what are in its opinion comparable requirements in respect of service and performance.
However the committee may choose to relax this requirement in certain cases such as where the service andor performance requirements are materially completed or where such factors are in the view of the c ommittee reflected in some other way such as a significant discount to the face value of the awards forfeited and where the c ommittee considers it to be in the interests of shareholders.
For external candidates it may be necessary to make additional awards in connection with the recruitment to buyout awards forfeited by the individual on leaving a previous employer.
For the avoidance of doubt buyout awards are not subject to a formal cap.

Summary of our audit approach Key risks t he key risks that we identified in the current year were Aircraft fleet Aircraft maintenance provisions Revenue recognition and provisioning and Deferred tax recognition.
Materiality t he materiality that we used in the current year was 1.90m. considered a number of measures and derived a figure based on revenue.
Scoping c onsistent with our approach in the prior year our group audit scope focused primarily on the audit work at the two components both in the UK being Flybe l imited passenger operations and Flybe Aviation services l imited maintenance repair and overhaul operations.
Significant changes in our approach Due to the continued changes to the fleet we have identified this as a key risk as there are material accounting impacts.
We no longer consider that passenger claims provisions to represent a key risk as the provisioning is based upon a wellestablished methodology and has historical data to support judgements applied.

We confirm that we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in respect of these matters.
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to t he directors confirmation on page 35 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the group including those that would threaten its business model future performance solvency or liquidity t he disclosures on pages 36 to 41 describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated t he directors statement in note 3 to the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them and their identification of any material uncertainties to the groups ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements and t he directors explanation on page 35 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the group over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We agreed with the directors adoption of the going concern basis of accounting and we did not identify any such material uncertainties.
However because not all future events or conditions can be predicted this statement is not a guarantee as to the groups ability to continue as a going concern.
Independence
We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting c ouncils ethical standards for Auditors and confirm that we are independent of the group and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.
We confirm that we are independent of the group and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.
We also confirm we have not provided any of the prohibited nonaudit services referred to in those standards.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement t he assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
Due to the continued changes to the fleet we have identified this as a key risk as there are material accounting impacts.
We no longer consider that passenger claims provisions to represent a key risk as the provisioning is based upon a wellestablished methodology and has historical data to support judgements applied.
Aircraft fleet Risk description c hanges in the fleet whether related to aircraft or components such as engines or to the associated loans and lease terms have material accounting impacts. terms as well as additional implications on maintenance accounting.
Additionally we have considered the valuation of the fleet.
Additional aircraft increase potential valuation risk. c hanges to the fleet and related risks are disclosed on page 30 and note 14.
How the scope of our audit responded to the risk For each aircraft and significant aircraft component delivered we have evaluated each lease to challenge the appropriateness of managements classification being treated as either an operating or finance lease.
For owned aircraft we have agreed the values capitalised to source documentation and have critically challenged the component accounting and separation of the aircraft components.
We have also evaluated the accuracy of useful economic lives and residual valuations including assessing external source data for similar assets.
We have challenged managements forecasts to support the carrying value of the fleet including evaluating the reasonableness of underlying assumptions and historical accuracy of forecasting.
We have agreed loans to agreements with counterparties and vouched the drawdown of funds.
We have also assessed the accounting and presentation of the related loans.
For leased aircraft we have challenged the completeness and accuracy of maintenance provisions required under the lease.
Key observations Based on our procedures we concluded that the classification and valuation of the new aircraft delivered in the year together with the related financing is appropriate and that the carrying value of the fleet is reasonable.

How the scope of our audit responded to the risk We evaluated the methodology and key assumptions adopted by management in their calculation of the aircraft maintenance provisions and evaluated the design and implementation of the controls in this process. terms and assessment of recent interval and cost experience.
We have supplemented this work with inquiry of engineering management in order to challenge the assumptions adopted in particular in relation to asset lives the utilisation pattern of the aircraft and the consistency of the provisions with their assessment of aircraft condition.
Key observations t he provisions for maintenance obligations and assumptions are appropriate in all material respects.
Revenue recognition and provisioning Risk description Group revenue includes 619.3m 2016 571.7m of passenger revenue for the year ended st march 2017.
Further detail is set out in note 5. financial statements. agreements as well as ancillary revenue. and in some cases judgment on the likely volume of rejected transactions.
How the scope of our audit responded to the risk We have evaluated the design and implementation of the key controls over revenue recognition and performed substantive tests and analytical procedures of related revenue and revenue provisions.
We have also challenged the judgements made in valuing the required revenue provisions which include challenging judgments with past experience to determine historical accuracy as well as the consistency of judgements and assumptions applied between financial periods. systems to the general ledger.
Key observations Based on our procedures the revenue provision estimates applied by management are appropriate.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Financial S tatement S Flybe Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 201617 Flybe Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 201617 109 Independent auditors report to the members of Flybe Group plc continued Deferred tax valuation Risk description A deferred net tax liability of 0.6m 2016 11.3m asset is recognised at 31 st march 2017 representing assets of 4.0m offset by liabilities of 4.6m.
Further detail is set out in the critical accounting judgements in note 4 and further detail is provided in note 23 as well as being included in the Audit c ommittee Report at page 76.
How the scope of our audit responded to the risk We have evaluated managements process to prepare the deferred tax calculation and evaluated the design and implementation of the controls in this process.
We critically assessed the judgements over the level of forecast taxable profits available to support the recoverability of recognised deferred tax assets.
We have also considered historical utilisation of unclaimed capital allowances.
We have involved tax specialists to assist with our assessment of the tax principles applied in the tax calculations being the treatment of long funding leases assessing capital allowances available on owned assets and treatment of financial instruments and pensions.
Key observations Based on our procedures the deferred tax valuation is consistent with the Groups assessment of future taxable profits and capital allowances available and our understanding of the business. our opinion thereon and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Our application of materiality We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced.
We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
Based on our professional judgement we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows Group materiality 1.90m 2016 1.67m.
Basis for determining materiality in determining materiality we considered a number of measures and derived a figure based on a percentage of revenue 0.27% in both the current and prior years.
Rationale for the benchmark applied t his measure provides a consistent basis to the prior year and its movement reflects the growth in the overall business.
Having also considered the groups profitability and key movements in its financial position such as fixed asset additions disposals and maintenance accounting entries we considered this level of materiality to be appropriate for the users of the financial statements.
