I am pleased to be able to report on considerable progress made by your company during the last year.
Overview
During 2017 revenue more than doubled.
We further extended and developed our UK distribution capability expanded our direct to market sales and successfully established a technology and distribution relationship with
Post year end we also completed our largest fundraising to date which saw us add two major institutional investors to the shareholder list.
We have built on the progress of the previous year with more market awareness distribution led sales and through ensuring Lightwave products and technology continue to develop.
In addition we have developed our direct sales capability supported by a dedicated customer services function.
The smart home market is now becoming more clearly defined which is helping Lightwave better communicate its proposition and capability.
Offering access to the Lightwave platform either directly or through Amazon Apple and Google as well as the growth of voice control opens up many opportunities for the business.
The broad challenge as ever will be to ensure we prioritise our strategic goals so that we bridge the gap between short term achievements and the longterm ambition to build a scaled business in the smart home sector.
We are continuing to strengthen our management and technology capability.
As well as welcoming new chief executive Andrew Pearson to the board in March we have broadened our teams skill sets with the addition of new staff.
This is all directed to putting solid building blocks in place for the much larger business we aim to create.
I would like to take the opportunity to thank our staff our suppliers and subcontractors for the effort they have applied during the year to achieve a further step change for the business.
Financials
Revenue for the 2017 financial year was 3.03 million more than double last year 2016 1.44 million.
Gross margins further improved to 35.5% 2016 32.5% benefiting from the growth of direct sales.
Administrative expenses were up to 2.12 million 2016 1.49 million as we spent more on marketing research and development.
Capitalised development expenditure was 0.69 million 2016 0.51 million in accordance with IAS38 reflecting the commitment to the development of our Generation 2 technology and devices.
The loss before and after tax was 0.85 million 2016 0.84 million.
Our balance sheet has now been considerably strengthened through our post financial year end fundraising giving a strong and stable foundation upon which to develop our business.
The proforma group statement of equity after this fundraising is as follows As reported Net funding proceeds Pro forma Total shareholders equity 1.23 4.90 6.13 LightwaveRF plc Strategic report Chairmans statement continued for the year ended 30 September 2017

We now have the funds in place to further strengthen our management capability marketing and sales as well as continuing to ensure our technology remains at the forefront of the smart home revolution.
We very much look forward to upping the pace of our progress through 2018.
Barry Gamble
13 December 2017 LightwaveRF plc Strategic report Chief executives report for the year ended 30 September 2017
2017 has seen strong progress for Lightwave with advances in technology products marketing sales and distribution.
Technology and Products We design and develop hardware devices and software.
Our range of almost 100 smart home devices now includes the recently launched Generation 2 which is also a part of the Apple HomeKit offering.
Manufacturing is outsourced to Asia and mainland Europe.
Platform hosting is with cloud based operators.
We have continued to grow our technology team and intend to bring in more talent as we invest in the further product development necessary to scale the Company.
As well as completing the development of the Generation 2 technology launched just a few weeks ago we also completed significant enhancements to our cloudbased platform.
This included integration with Google Assistant voice control for the Google Home device.
Consumer uptake of our Amazon Alexa integration has continued with over 8000 Lightwave customers now using our Amazon Alexa Skill for voice control.
We have filed a series of patent applications to provide protection to our technology and plan further filings of new developments.
Marketing
Our marketing uses consumer oriented messages such as Your Home.
Smarter.
We recently launched a new website under the brand Lightwave.
In addition to product description and guides the website now offers full online ordering.
We are now using various digital marketing techniques to generate direct sales demand build market awareness and develop the Lightwave brand.
This is supported by media relations programmes to secure coverage in both specialist and generalist outlets.
Sales and Distribution We sell both our Generation 1 and 2 devices primarily through distribution partners.
We have recently added Exertis as a distributor to enable us to supply Apple who are retailing our Generation 2 devices both online and in UK and UAE stores.
We will continue to develop our distribution strategy to ensure we market our devices effectively and generate increasing demand.
A growing proportion of our sales are being made directly to consumers.
As well as providing another route to market this has significant benefit for us to fully understand the customer experience and to be able to directly tap in to their feedback.
Principal risks and uncertainties A summary of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group can be seen within the Directors report on page LightwaveRF plc Strategic report Chief executives report continued for the year ended 30 September 2017 2017 Results The revenues for the year more than doubled to 3.03 million 2016 1.44 million through further stocking by our distributors and direct consumer sales.
Gross profit also more than doubled to 1.08 million 2016 0.47 million in line with the increase in revenue.
Gross margin rose to 35.5% 2016 32.5% with direct consumer sales starting to make a material contribution.
We recognise the scope to improve margins as we scale operations.
Administrative expenses increased to 2.12 million 2016 1.49 million as the Group invested further in sales marketing research and development.
Capitalised development costs under IAS38 increased to 0.69 million 2016 0.51 million driven mostly by the investment in our Generation 2 technology.
As anticipated the amortisation of intangible assets increased substantially to 0.3 million 2016 0.1 million in line with our policy of amortising as projects reach completion.
Research and development tax credits of 0.25 million 2016 0.21 million were recognised as other income before stated pre and post tax losses of 0.85 million 2016 0.84 million.
As we achieve financial progress through our increased revenue and gross profit we plan to invest more in technology and marketing for the medium to longer term.
Our distributor order book which at 30 November 2017 month end exceeded 700000 at current exchange rates.
As the smart home market becomes faster moving we are seeing shorter lead times for orders and direct consumer sales have no order component.
Cash absorbed from operations increased to 0.89 million 2016 0.63 million with inventories up in support of our direct consumer sales activity.
Cash invested mostly in the development of our technology increased to 0.72 million 2016 0.52 million.
Cash balances at 30 September 2017 were 220000 2016 2000 even as we approached the conclusion of the programme to launch Generation 2 into Apple HomeKit.
The year end balance sheet saw shareholders equity much improved to 1.22 million 2016 deficit 0.17 million after the December 2016 fundraising of 2.2 million met the cash outflow from operating losses and the continued investment in technology.
Long and short term loans and borrowings were substantially reduced to 0.59 million 2016 0.99 million.
Key Performance Indicators The Group monitors revenue gross margin operating cash and also uses the following key indicators to measure the performance of the business in terms of progress against key strategic objectives 2017 2016 Global installations 46000 40000 Connected devices 400000 300000 Monthly temperature and energy data points UK customers 63 million 52 million Investment in research and development million  million Expensed 0.19 0.10 Capitalised 0.69 LightwaveRF plc Strategic report Chief executives report continued for the year ended 30 September 2017
We continue to believe there is an opportunity for a UK Company that offers a wide and deep range of integrated smart home solutions to achieve significant scale.
The competitive environment remains broadly the same as it has done for some time in that gadgets single device and single market segment solutions prevail while we offer a distinctive stylish and affordable smart home experience.
During 2018 we will focus on the following key steps Undertaking a rolling launch of a comprehensive range of new Generation 2 devices from early 2018 Enhancing our recently redesigned app to give our customers increasing capabilities for the coordination and control of their smart home Broadening our cloud platform capabilities with further integration and interoperability features for non Lightwave devices and software Continue building our marketing function and increase investment to build our brand utilising product and customer focused approaches Expand our direct sales function introducing a field based home visit sales team Add further distributors that complement and extend our distribution capability Launching an international device range following an indication from Apple that they are actively considering offering our Generation 2 sockets and switches to their online and retail customer base in 25 European countries.
Outlook
2017 has been a pivotal year for the Group.
Having launched Generation 2 devices into the market we are now moving to pursue our goal of creating a scaled Company able to compete with the major brands in the smart home market.
In 2018 we will move to strengthen our management team in marketing sales and technology enhancing the talented group which has achieved considerable progress to date.
We recognise the ability to retain and attract suitably qualified and experienced staff will be critical to our success and growth.
Consumer awareness and understanding of the benefits of smart home technology continues to rise and our market opportunity is increasingly large.
Our relationship with Apple is a significant asset that supports our growth in the UK and which should also allow us to enter international markets efficiently.
We look forward to building a great company in the rapidly growing smart home market.

We consider the risk of completeness of revenue to be high due to the volume of transactions undertaken by the Group and the significant increase in revenues compared to the previous period.
In this area our audit procedures included We performed cut off procedures by testing items from revenue recognised during the year and subsequent to year end to gain assurance over the completeness of revenue recognised in the year.
We tested credit notes issued after the balance sheet date to assess appropriate revenue recognition in the period.
We looked for and tested journal entries within normal business processes relating to revenue transactions close to the year end to ensure they were valid by agreeing the journals to originating documentation.
We performed other substantive transactional testing and analytical procedures to validate that revenue transactions had been appropriately recognised at the right time in line with the Groups accounting policy.
We ensured that the financial statement disclosures were in accordance with accounting standards.
Carrying value of intangible assets The Groups intangible assets in respect of capitalised development costs and expenditure on platform software development represent the most significant asset on its Statement of Financial Position totalling 1210071 as at 30 September 2017.
Management and the Directors are required to ensure that only costs which meet the IFRS criteria of an asset and accord with the Groups accounting policy are capitalised.
Given the significance of the assets on the Groups Statement of Financial Position and the significant management judgement involved in the determination of the capitalisation of costs and the assessment of the carrying values of the assets there is an increased risk of material misstatement.
In this area our audit procedures included We performed substantive testing on samples of the expenses and labour capitalised in the year in order to assess whether the expenses had been appropriately capitalised and the accounting treatment was in line with the Groups accounting policy.
We evaluated Managements and the Directors impairment reviews which assessed each sub category of asset held by the Group.
We critically challenged the considerations made of whether or not there were any indicators of impairment identified.
We critically reviewed the disclosures included in the financial statements.
Our application of materiality We set certain thresholds for materiality.
These helped us to determine the nature timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements both individually and on the financial statements as a whole.
We determined the materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole to be 45000 calculated with reference to a benchmark of turnover of which it represents 1.5%.
This is the threshold above which missing or incorrect information in financial statements is considered to have an impact on the decision making of users.
We reported to the Audit Committee all potential adjustments in excess of 1350 being 3% of the materiality for the financial statements as a whole.
LightwaveRF plc Independent auditors report to the members of LightwaveRF plc continued for the year ended 30 September 2017 An overview of the scope of our audit We considered the risk of the financial statements being misstated or not prepared in accordance with the underlying legislation or standards.
We then directed our work toward areas of the financial statements which we assessed as having the highest risk of containing material misstatements.
We tested and examined information using both analytical procedures and tests of detail to the extent necessary to provide us with a reasonable basis to draw conclusions.
These procedures gave us the evidence that we need for our opinion on the Groups financial statements as a whole and in particular helped mitigate the risks of material misstatement mentioned above.
We also documented and reviewed the Groups systems primarily to confirm that they form an adequate basis for the preparation of the financial statements but also to identify the controls operated to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the data.
Other information The Directors are responsible for the other information.
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report other than the financial statements and our auditors report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements our responsibility is to read the other information and in doing so consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information.
If based on the work we have performed we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 In our opinion based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit the information given in the strategic Report and the directors Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements and the strategic Report and the directors Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Parent Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Directors
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if in our opinion adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us or the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns or certain disclosures of Directors remuneration specified by law are not made or we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
LightwaveRF plc Independent auditors report to the members of LightwaveRF plc continued for the year ended 30 September 2017 Responsibilities of directors As explained more fully in the Directors responsibilities Statement set out on page 16 the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements the directors are responsible for assessing the Groups and the Parent Companys ability to continue as a going concern disclosing as applicable matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditors report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAsUK will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if individually or in the aggregate they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Councils website at www. rc. iteauditorsresponsibilities.
This description forms part of our auditors report.

Its registered office is Innovation Campus Birmingham Faraday Wharf Holt Street Birmingham B7 4BB and its registered number is .
The Groups financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2017 consolidate the individual financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries.
The Groups principal activity is the design and development of devices and software to remotely control commercial and domestic lighting heating power and security.
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the Financial Statements are set out below.
The policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented unless otherwise stated.
These Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards International Accounting Standards and Interpretations collectively IFRSs issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB as adopted by the European Union adopted IFRSs.
The Financial Statements have also been prepared in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies preparing Financial Statements in accordance with IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis.
Where the company has control over an investee it is classified as a subsidiary.
The company controls an investee if all three of the following elements are present power over the investee exposure to variable returns from the investee and the ability of the investor to use its power to affect those variable returns.
Control is reassessed whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there may be a change in any of these elements of control.
Defacto control exists in situations where the company has the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee without holding the majority of the voting rights.
In determining whether defacto control exists the company considers all relevant facts and circumstances including The size of the companys voting rights relative to both the size and dispersion of other parties who hold voting rights Substantive potential voting rights held by the company and by other parties Other contractual arrangements and Historic patterns in voting attendance.
The consolidated financial statements present the results of the Company and its subsidiaries the Group as if they formed a single entity.
Intercompany transactions and balances between group companies are therefore eliminated in full.
LightwaveRF plc Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 30 September 2017 GENERAL INFORMATION continued b ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued ii Basis of consolidation continued The Financial Statements have been prepared using the reverse accounting provisions that were incorporated in International Financial Reporting Standard 3 as issued in 2004.
Reverse acquisition accounting was determined to be required in accounting for the business combination of the Company and LightwaveRF Technology Limited because following the business combination the Parent Company is effectively controlled by the Board and the former shareholders of LightwaveRF Technology Limited.
In effect the transaction is accounted for as though LightwaveRF Technology Limited was the acquiring Company rather than the acquired and LightwaveRF Plc has been treated as a subsidiary.
The reverse acquisition reserve consists of amounts arising from the adjustment made to the equity instruments of the legal acquiree in reverse acquisition accounting.
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sales of goods in the ordinary course of the Groups activities excluding VAT and other sales taxes returns rebates and discounts.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the Group has transferred the significant risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer and it is probable that the Group will receive previously agreed payment.
These criteria are considered to be met when the goods are delivered to the buyer.
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation and depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
For the purpose of assessing impairment assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash generating units.
Nonfinancial assets that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
Items of property plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Depreciation is provided for at 33% per annum straight line on all items of property plant and equipment so as to write off their carrying values over their useful economic lives.
Any gain or loss arising from disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the fair value of the sales proceeds and the amount of the asset and is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
LightwaveRF plc Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 30 September 2017 GENERAL INFORMATION continued b ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued vi Financial assets The Group classifies its financial assets into one of the categories discussed below depending on the purpose for which the asset was acquired.
The Group has not classified any of its financial assets held to maturity.
The Groups accounting policy for each category is as follows Trade and other receivables These assets are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They arise principally through the provision of goods and services to customers e. also incorporate other types of contractual monetary asset.
They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to their acquisition or issue and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method less provision for impairment.
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence such as financial difficulties on the part of the counterparty or significant delay in payment that the Group will be unable to collect all of the amounts due under the terms receivable the amount of such a provision being the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future expected cash flows associated with the impaired receivable.
For trade receivables which are reported net such provisions are recorded in a separate allowance account with the loss being recognised within administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
On confirmation that the trade receivable will not be collectable the gross carrying value is written off against the associated provision.
The Groups loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise current and deposit account bank balances which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value with deposit maturity of three months or less from inception.
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Costs of ordinarily interchangeable items are assigned using the first in first out cost formula.
Costs principally comprise of materials and bringing them to their present location.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs to completion and costs to be incurred in marketing selling and distribution.
LightwaveRF plc Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 30 September 2017 GENERAL INFORMATION continued b ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued viii Financial liabilities The Group classifies its financial liabilities into the following categories depending on the purpose for which the liability was acquired.
The Groups accounting policy for each category is as follows Interest bearing loans and borrowings Interestbearing loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value net of any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the instrument.
Such interest bearing liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method which ensures that any interest expense over the period to repayment is at a constant rate on the balance of the liability carried in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Interest
Trade and other payables Trade payables and other shortterm monetary liabilities which are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The tax creditexpense represents the sum of the tax currently payable research and development tax credits and deferred tax.
Current tax Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in different accounting periods and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the statement of financial position date.
Research and development Research and development tax credits are recognised on qualifying expenditure that meets the criteria set out by HMRC guidance in period in which the associated expenditure is incurred.
RandD tax credits have been surrendered against tax losses brought forward and therefore treated as grant income and disclosed as other income in the Income
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the Financial Statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the statement of financial position liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
LightwaveRF plc Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 30 September 2017 GENERAL INFORMATION continued b ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued ix Taxation continued Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilise the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each financial position date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period in which the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the statement of financial position date.
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects at the reporting date to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received or contractually receivable net of direct costs of issue.
Equitysettled sharebased payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equitysettled sharebased payments is expensed on a straightline basis over the vesting period based on the Groups estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest.
At each statement of financial position date the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest.
The impact of the revision of the original estimates if any is recognised in profit or loss over the remaining vesting period with a corresponding adjustment to the share based payment reserve.
Equitysettled sharebased payment transactions with other parties are measured at the fair value of the goods or services received except where the fair value cannot be estimated reliably in which case they are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments granted measured at the date the entity obtains the goods or the counterparty renders the service.
LightwaveRF plc Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 30 September 2017 GENERAL INFORMATION continued b ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued xii Convertible debt The proceeds received on issue of the Group and Companys convertible debt are allocated into their liability and equity components.
The amount initially attributed to the debt component equals the discounted cash flows using a market rate of interest that would be payable on a similar debt instrument that does not include an option to convert.
Subsequently the debt component is accounted for as a financial liability measured at amortised cost until extinguished on conversion or maturity of the bond.
Where the conversion component does not confer a fixed amount of shares for a fixed amount of cash this component is reflected as part of the financial liability.
When shares are issued to extinguish all or part of a financial liability they are recognised initially at their fair value at the date of issue.
The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability extinguished and fair value of the shares is recognised as a gain or loss in profit or loss within the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Transactions entered into by Group entities in a currency other than the trading Companys functional currency Pounds Sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
At each statement reporting date monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the reporting date.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items and on the retranslation of monetary items are recognised in profit or loss.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
Development expenditure on internally developed products and the platform software development is capitalised if it can be demonstrated that it is technically feasible to develop the product for it to be sold adequate resources are available to complete the development there is an intention to complete and sell the product the Group is able to sell the product sale of the product will generate future economic benefits and expenditure on the project can be measured reliably.
Capitalised development costs are amortised over the periods the Group expects to benefit.
Capitalised platform software development costs are amortised on completion of specific projects.
The amortisation expense is included within the administrative expenses line in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The amortisation period will be monitored and reassessed as the platform and products evolve although it is anticipated to be a period of three years on a straight line basis.
LightwaveRF plc Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 30 September 2017 GENERAL INFORMATION continued b ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued xvi Intangible assets continued Development expenditure that does not satisfy the above criteria and expenditure on the research phase of internal projects are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The estimates and judgements that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the Financial Statements are discussed below The fair value of share based payments has been estimated using the binomial method and a reserve created in the accounts Research and development expenditure and the costs of building the platform have been allocated to individual projects and products in accordance with the requirements of IAS38.
Intangible assets are amortised from the date of launch to market or in the case of the platform when it is brought into use over the period the group expects to benefit currently anticipated to be a period of 3 years.
The value of intangible assets has been reviewed for impairment and no provision is required Research and development tax credits are calculated using HMRC guidance regarding cash recoverable for research and development expenditure surrendered Intercompany loans have been reviewed for impairment using future estimated cash flows.
The directors have concluded that no impairment is required Warranty provisions have been estimated based on product returned from customers.
This was estimated as zero at the 2017 and 2016 year ends and accordingly no warranty provisions have been made and Stock provision is based on slow moving stock items.
LightwaveRF plc Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 30 September 2017 GENERAL INFORMATION continued New Standards A number of new standards and amendments to existing standards have been published which are mandatory but are not effective for the year ended 30 September 2017.
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these revised standards and interpretations will have a significant impact on the figures included in the financial statements in the period of initial application other than the following IFRS 9 Financial Instruments The standard is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
The standard makes substantial changes to the measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities.
There will only be three categories of financial assets whereby financial assets are recognised at either fair value through profit and loss fair value through other comprehensive income or measured at amortised cost.
On adoption of the standard the Group will have to redetermine the classification of its financial assets based on the business model for each category of financial asset.
This is not considered likely to give rise to any significant adjustments other than reclassifications.
Most financial liabilities will continue to be carried at amortised cost however some financial liabilities will be required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss.
IFRS 15  Revenue from contracts with customers The standard has been developed to provide a comprehensive set of principles in presenting the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from a contract with a customer.
The standard is based around the following steps in recognising revenue Identify the contract with the customer Identify the performance obligations in the contract Determine the transaction price Allocate the transaction price and Recognise revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied.
On application of the standard the disclosures are likely to increase.
The standard includes principles on disclosing the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers by providing qualitative and quantitative information.
The Directors do not anticipate the changes to have a material impact on the reported results.
The standard is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
It was endorsed by the EU in September 2016.
IFRS 16  Leases The standard is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and can be applied before that date if the Company also applies IFRS 15 revenue from Contracts with Customers.
IFRS 16 eliminates the classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases for a lessee.
Instead all leases are treated in a similar way to finance leases applying IAS 17.
Leases are capitalised by recognising the present value of the lease payments and showing them either as lease assets rightofuse assets or together with property plant and equipment.
If lease payments are made over time a company also recognises a financial liability representing its obligation to make future lease payments.
IFRS 16 replaces the typical straightline operating lease expense for those leases applying IAS 17 with a depreciation charge for lease assets included within operating costs and an interest expense on lease liabilities included within finance costs.
The Directors do not anticipate the changes to have a material impact on the reported results.
