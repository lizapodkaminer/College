New pubs acquired Pubs from VGR acquired Pubs portfolio 7 site 6 Shepherd Neame annual report and accounts 2017 I am delighted to report a strong set of results for the 52 weeks ended 24 June 2017 a year of significant investment in new pubs.
The performance has been good in all operating divisions in the Company and excellent progress has been made against our strategic objectives.
I have been particularly impressed by the pace of change in the business in recent years as the team modernise the pubs and brands portfolio and innovate to address the continuous challenge to enhance the customer experience.
Our growth primarily comes from reinvesting year after year in our core business and from driving ever greater efficiency and excellence in execution.
This year has been notable for a strong underlying performance some excellent work to enhance our own brand portfolio important steps to modernise the brewing operation and a period of significant investment with the acquisition of 14 new pubs.
The core strengths of Shepherd Neame lie in a strong sense of family a distinct individual character and a passion for quality for high standards and for making continuous improvements within a consistent strategic framework.
These characteristics deliver a strong and sustainable business for the longterm benefit of shareholders.
Equally important is our ability to take advantage of good opportunities when they arise and to be responsive to changes in the market.
Financial results Turnover for the period increased by 11.7% to 156.2m 2016 139.9m driven by the acquisitions and strong managed house likeforlike growth of 8.1%.
Underlying operating profit grew by 7.2% to 15.3m 2016 14.2m.
Underlying profit before tax grew by 8.0% to 11.2m 2016 10.3m and underlying basic earnings per share are up 8.0% to 59.1p 2016 54.7p.
Statutory profit before tax is down 18.0% to 11.8m 2016 14.4m predominantly because we achieved an unusually high profit on disposal of property in the prior year.
Basic earnings per ordinary share are down to 69.1p 2016 84.0p.
Dividend
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 22.73p 2016 22.05p making the total dividend for the year 28.35p 2016 27.50p an increase of 3.1%.
This represents underlying dividend cover of 2.1 times 2016 2.0 times.
We will continue to target our dividend cover at or above this level in the future.
The final dividend will be paid on 13 October 2017 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 29 September 2017.
This level of dividend cover is consistent with the policy stated at the time of our share capital reorganisation in 2014.
Since then the total annual dividend paid to shareholders has increased from 3.2m to 4.2m.
Capital and investment Capital expenditure was 38.0m.
Within this sum 24.8m was invested in the acquisition of UES eight pubs from Ei Group plc and five pubs in the acquisition of VGR in November 2016.
We realised proceeds from property sales of 5.9m 2016 11.9m.
Net debt has consequently increased from 60.1m at June 2016 to 78.1m at June 2017.
Board of Directors Following the review of our strategy for brewing and brands as set out in the Chief Executives Report and as part of the transition from brewing Asahi Super Dry the role of Brewing and Brands Director is no longer required.
Graeme Craig is consequently stepping down from his role as a Director in September 2017 and will be leaving the business.
Graeme has made a considerable contribution to the business since joining in 2006.
He has greatly developed and enhanced the brand portfolio and consolidated the sales marketing and production activities into a single brewing and brands division.
I would like to thank him for what he has done and wish him well for the future.
We are streamlining our management roles in this area.
We have recently appointed Andy Pinnock as Head of Sales and Giles Hilton as Head of Customer Relations.
We are currently recruiting a Head of Marketing Brands Profit before any profit or loss on the disposal of properties investment property fair value movements and exceptional items.
CHAIRMANS STATEMENT
A strong set of results and a year of significant investment.
MILES TEMPLEMAN Chairman  StrategicReport
Financial Statements Other Information 7 site 6 Shepherd Neame annual report and accounts 2017 and Communications and a Head of Production as Richard Frost retires in 2018.
These senior positions will report to the Chief Executive.
Government and regulation The Company makes a substantial contribution to the local and national economy.
In 2017 we have paid 28.7m in excise duty alone.
It is disappointing therefore after three years of successive excise cuts that the Chancellor chose to increase duty on beer by 3p per pint in the last budget.
This coincides with substantial increases in business rates and in the national living wage and with the introduction of the apprenticeship levy.
These inflationary pressures come at a time of rising inflation in food and imported products and provide cost challenges to all businesses in the sector at a time of great political uncertainty.
In July 2016 the Small Business Enterprise and Employment Bill which introduced the Statutory Code of Practice and Market Rent Option MRO became law.
This affects only those large companies which have more than 500 pubs.
We believe that effective operation of the voluntary code will make extension of the statutory code unlikely.
Advisors
Since the year end the Company appointed Peel Hunt LLP as its corporate broker in place of Panmure Gordon and Co with effect from 1 August 2017.
Summary
This has been an excellent year for the
The Board is focussed on investing for the longterm benefit of shareholders in line with our aims to be a Great British Brewer and to run the best pubs.
The investment in our brands and pubs continues to transform the profile and quality of assets in the Company.
The managed estate has now become our largest business division by turnover and has been our principal engine for growth.
Our tenanted business is high quality and robust after many years of investing to drive up standards.
It generates substantial and sustainable free cash flow and continues to attract exceptional operators.
In the brewing and brands business we have an extended period of transition ahead of us as the arrangements with Asahi come to an end.
However the underlying trends in this division are encouraging and our emerging innovative and broad brand portfolio gives good reason for optimism.
These three business divisions generate strong cash flow and all contribute to the growing reputation the Company has for offering a great experience to our customers.
The new brand identity has strengthened our profile further.
Whilst the performance has been good the shortterm horizon is clouded by the inflationary pressures on the business and the mediumterm horizon by the uncertainty over the UKs exit from the European Union.
Shepherd Neame is as has been demonstrated over the years a resilient and flexible business capable of rapidly adjusting to and succeeding in an ever changing world.
We remain confident to continue to invest for the longterm benefit of shareholders.
Miles Templeman Chairman 9 site 8 Shepherd Neame annual report and accounts 2017 OUR PUBS TO DRIVE FOOTFALL TO The Farmhouse West Malling one of eight acquisitions from Ei Group plc.
Raising standards We have started the roll out of a new pub signage scheme following the introduction of the new brand identity.
Unique locations We own many pubs in unique locations such as the Belle Vue Tavern at Pegwell Bay where we have introduced an outside cocktail bar.
Stylish interiors Striking interior features are helping to make our venues stand out in the market.
Design innovation We use our inhouse team and work with a variety of designers to create the best schemes for our pubs.
We aim to drive footfall by designing and developing unique pubs and hotels with a wow factor.
OUR STRATEGY
Governance
Financial Statements Other Information 9 site 8 Shepherd Neame annual report and accounts 2017 OUR PUBS TO DRIVE FOOTFALL TO 11 site 10 Shepherd Neame annual report and accounts 2017 This has been an exciting year of development for the Company with good progress in all areas of the business a strong underlying performance and some great acquisitions that add real value to the Company.
We have successfully pursued our strategy to drive longterm value for our shareholders based around four key objectives To drive footfall to our pubs To develop our offer to enhance the customer experience To create demand and build awareness for our brands To attract retain and develop the best people It is this consistent strategy that has enabled the Company to outperform the national market year after year and to excel on a local basis.
We have modernised and improved our business such that the profile and quality of our pubs and brands have been greatly enhanced and the offer and experience for our customer transformed.
Furthermore as our heartland of Kent enjoys the benefit of infrastructural development and the regeneration of the coastal areas our strong local knowledge enables us to exploit the opportunities that arise.
Whilst the weather conditions have been favourable during this year with a long hot summer in 2016 and plenty of sunshine in the spring of 2017 market conditions have become progressively harder as consumer spending is being squeezed by inflation.
Nonetheless we have achieved impressive likeforlike sales growth in our managed estate of 8.1% against the Coffer Peach Tracker Index of 1.4% and own beer volume growth excluding contract of 3.9% against the market of 0.2% Source BBPA.
In pursuit of our objectives this year has been characterised by some significant achievements Acquisition of 14 pubs The launch of a new brand identity Some exciting new product developments Completion of the initial phase of our modernisation plan for the brewery and its buildings We have successfully delivered these projects whilst maintaining strong underlying growth across the business.
We have also developed our future brewing and brands strategy namely to build our own brands drive necessary cost reduction and streamline management roles where appropriate as we exit the Asahi contract in the coming year.
We have an outstanding team of people renowned for their passion and commitment their expertise and indepth knowledge of the business their friendliness and approachability.
These characteristics distinguish Shepherd Neame and give it its unique personality.
It is this personality that is the differentiator to build customer loyalty where quality and value for money are taken for granted.
All operators in the sector face significant cost inflation through increasing business rates the national living wage and the apprenticeship levy.
The fall in the value of sterling following the EU referendum has compounded these challenges and is driving up prices in food and other imported products such as wine.
We will continue to focus on enhancing the customer experience raising standards across our business and driving efficiencies as appropriate to mitigate this cost and to take advantage of the opportunities that are presented.
Tenanted and Managed Pub Operations
At the yearend we operated 327 pubs and hotels 2016 328 of which 285 are freehold 2016 285.
Of our total pubs 66 2016 54 were managed and 253 2016 267 were tenanted or leased and eight 2016 seven operated under commercial free of tie leases.
Our investment focus is to improve the quality of our core business and to seek highquality singlesite acquisition opportunities within our heartland if they improve the overall business or reach new markets.
We will pursue suitable opportunities outside our historic trading area and are alive to opportunities to acquire small groups of pubs that meet our requirements as evidenced by recent pub purchases.
We are seeking to acquire sites with unique character in landmark or highfootfall locations preferably with the potential for further development.
During the last five years we have acquired 22 pubs and disposed of 49.
As a consequence of this and investments in the core estate the profile and quality of our pub estate have been transformed and since 2012 the average EBITDAR per managed pub has increased by 30.5% and per tenanted pub by 25.4%.
This has been a year of record investments with total cash invested in new pub acquisitions of 24.8m 2016 3.3m in three separate transactions during the year.
First at the start of the financial year we announced an acquisition of eight freehold pubs in Kent Surrey and Sussex from Ei Group plc.
All these pubs continue to be operated by their existing licensees except the Crown and Anchor Shoreham by Sea which has transferred to the managed estate and Earls Maidstone which will transfer in the coming year.

We continue to manage our property actively aiming to dispose of those pubs which no longer fit our longterm strategy and to invest to maximise the potential of those that do.
Driving Footfall to our Pubs We aim to drive footfall by designing and developing unique pubs and hotels with a wow factor.
We believe continuous investment in our facilities will attract and retain customers.
In particular we continue to develop our accommodation business and exploit the growth in the local visitor economy.
In addition to the new pub acquisitions we have invested 8.3m 2016 7.3m of capital expeniture in improving the look and feel of our pubs and 2.4m 2016 2.2m in repairs and decorations.
In the managed estate major developments during this year have included 1.0m investment at the Minnis Bay Bar and Brasserie 0.9m at the Ostrich Colnbrook where 11 bedrooms have been added and the Manor Farm Barn Southfleet.
All these investments have transformed the outlets and the results have been encouraging.
In the tenanted estate we carried out major developments at a number of sites including the East Kent Whitstable the Plough Farnham the Old House at Home Dormansland and the Sportsman Seasalter.
Following the launch of our new brand identity we have invested an additional 0.4m in the development of a new pub signage scheme and website with enhanced functionality and improved user experience.
In conjunction with this we have improved all the photography on our pub microsites to bring out the character and individuality of each outlet.
We intend to roll out the new signage scheme over the coming years.
By the end of the summer 45 schemes were completed.
Developing our offer to enhance the customer experience We aim to enhance the customer experience in our pubs by delivering great fresh food providing accommodation of character and offering an interesting range of products.
Our food continues to provide good growth in the business in spite of intense competition in casual dining.
Food sales now represent 33% 2016 30% of our managed turnover with drinks representing 56% 2016 58% and accommodation 10% 2016 11%.
We continue to build the food skills in our business and drive the quality of our offer.
The acquisitions of both UES and VGR have brought fresh ideas and we have also enjoyed great success with new food offers at the Minnis Bay Bar and Brasserie and the Ship and Trades Chatham Maritime.
During the year we have refurbished 37 rooms 2016 35 and added 11 rooms at the Ostrich 2016 4 rooms at the Ship and Trades and now offer a total of 294 2016 283 all presented to a high standard.
Occupancy grew again from its record high last year to 79% 2016 78% whilst RevPAR continued to grow to 66 2016 63.
As the consumer becomes more willing to experiment across the drinks range we are always looking to innovate or introduce new concepts.
We are constantly looking to introduce more premium products to strengthen our range and enhance the experience for our customers.
Our beer offer has been greatly developed in the last two years.
We are particularly excited about our emerging beer portfolio as we exploit the potential from our heritage brands and recent innovations.
We have further expanded our range of premium local products in particular gin juices and English sparkling wine and developed our range of mixers and fresh fruit cocktails.
During the year our likeforlike drinks sales were 8.0% 2016 3.1%.
Attracting retaining and developing the best people We aim to attract retain and develop the best people by understanding the potential in everyone inspiring them to achieve their goals and by building the loyalty and engagement of our licensees and employees through the professionalism of the support we provide.
I am particularly pleased with the progress we have made in recent years with our tenanted licensees.

Our Love Beer programme to educate and inform all staff on beer and brewing has proved very successful and has driven an increased awareness and passion for beer across our business.
We continue to enhance the skills at head office in support of our licensees.
In the last year we have expanded our food development and field training teams and reduced the number of pubs per district manager in the managed and tenanted estates to bring even more focus to their work.
The Shepherd Neame Pub Awards continue to recognise excellence and achievement.
This year T ony and Shirley Pearson of The Belle Vue T avern Pegwell Bay won the Pub of the Year.
It is particularly pleasing that we now have three pubs listed in the T op 50 Gastropubs in the country.
It is also encouraging that we seem able to attract and support innovative licensees with diverse offers.
Tenanted and Managed Pub
We have pursued a consistent strategy to invest in our pubs over a sustained period and this has resulted in a strong trading performance year after year.
Total divisional turnover in the managed estate grew by 26.2% 2016 9.8% including the impact of new acquisitions.
Divisional underlying operating profit grew by 18.0% to 9.0m 2016 restated Same outlet likeforlike sales grew by 8.1% 2016 4.4% with drinks 8.0% 2016 3.1% food 7.7% 2016 4.2% and accommodation 10.1% 2016 11.7%.
Average EBITDAR per managed pub grew by 1.8% 2016 1.0%.
Margins were impacted in the managed estate by the cost pressures affecting all operators in the sector.
The total inflation from business rates national living wage and the apprenticeship levy was 0.2m in the year.
Looking forward these pressures will continue and this area of the business will require likeforlike growth of around 34% to cover these additional costs.
T otal divisional turnover in the tenanted and leased estate grew by 2.8% to 34.4m 2016 33.5m on 14 fewer outlets.
Divisional underlying operating profit was 13.0m 2016 restated 12.7m.
Likeforlike EBITDAR per tenanted pub grew by 1.6% 2016 2.7%.
Average EBITDAR per tenanted pub grew by 5.6% 2016 6.4%.
Brewing and Brands The brewing and brands division has enjoyed a successful year some exciting brand launches and the redevelopment of our brewhouse.
The strength of the Shepherd Neame offer is a wide portfolio of highquality products that suits many different customer needs in an increasingly fragmented market.
We have continued to outperform and have achieved impressive volume growth of 3.9% against a market of modest decline of 0.2% Source BBPA.
The Whitstable Bay Collection has again performed well with growth of 20.5% 2016 19.5% and now represents 10% of our own beer excluding contract.
The Spitfire range has returned to growth of 2.2% 2016 3.7% and represents 22% of own beer excluding contract.
We have invested 0.7m in restoring the fabric and infrastructure of our historic site and completing the installation of the new mash tuns.
In the coming year we are planning to instal a new labeller on our bottling line together with associated line improvements.
As previously announced our licence to brew and sell Asahi Super Dry will terminate at the end of February 2018.
The brand represented 23% of our total brewed volume at the year end.
In anticipation of the end of this contract we have carried out a strategic review of our beer business and operation on this site so as to mitigate much of its impact.
Whilst we have investigated other licence partnerships we no longer feel that this type of world lager fits our portfolio.
Furthermore we see considerable opportunity from our emerging portfolio as the consumer seeks premium British products.
We anticipate that brewing volumes will reduce in the shortterm.
We believe it is the best strategy in the long term to allocate more of our limited capacity to build our own brands and focus on those parts of the market where we have a competitive advantage or a strong position.
We have determined to modernise our plant to drive cost efficiency higher productivity and quality enhancements.
We expect turnover in this division to fall in line with volume in the near term.
We are taking appropriate action to streamline our management structure reduce our overheads and operating costs accordingly.
As a result of these changes a oneoff exceptional cost is expected in 2018.
Going forward we are targeting ongoing divisional underlying EBITDA of around 3.5m.
The consequence of these actions following a period of transition will be a smaller higher quality brewing and brands business producing great beers

Creating demand and building awareness for our brands We aim to create demand and build awareness for our brands by developing a range of distinctive beers by instilling a passion for quality and by having a great engagement with our customers.
The brewhouse investment and renovation works have driven greater efficiency and ever higher standards of quality in our beers.
The marketing team have had a busy year as they have developed a very compelling and exciting new portfolio including the introduction of Cinque Five Grain Premium Lager and Orchard View a cider made in collaboration with Aspall.
The new brand identity has been well received by consumers and we received an award for it at the prestigious Mobius
Our products receive many plaudits and we won three gold medals at the British Bottlers Institute Awards and one gold at the International Brewing Awards.
The Whitstable Bay Collection continues to enjoy great success with increasing distribution and brand awareness.
Whitstable Bay Red IPA was added to the range this year.
Spitfire Gold and Spitfire Lager The Lager of Britain were new extensions to the Spitfire brand last year and have performed above expectations.
We have continued to support a variety of local and customer events such as the Battle of Medway 350th Anniversary commemoration through sponsorship and marketing activity.
To raise awareness of our new brands we opened a popup shop at Bluewater for the first time with considerable success.
The store was named Store of the Week by Retail Week.
Brewing and Brands Performance Divisional turnover for the year was 4.4% at 59.8m 2016 57.3m.
Own beer volume excluding contract was 216000 barrels 2016 208000 barrels and grew by 3.9% 2016 0.3%.
Divisional underlying operating profit was 1.6m 2016 restated 1.6m after having absorbed incremental costs of water recovery of 0.3m which we are working to mitigate now that the operation is maturing.
Investment Property The Company owns 6.8m of investment property revalued at June 2017.
The principal land holding is the residual land at Queen Court Ospringe.
In 2016 10 acres of this holding were disposed of with planning permission for residential development.
During 2017 the Company promoted two further sites in the local plan that we consider suitable for housing.
These are complex and expensive sites to develop and both have been rejected at this stage but we will revisit in due course should circumstances change.
The rest of the land holdings will be held as agricultural farm land for the long term.
The Company reviews all of its property holdings on a regular basis.
Current Trading Since the start of the new financial year we have made steady progress albeit with colder and unsettled weather compared to 2016.
In the 10 weeks to 2 September 2017 same outlet likeforlike managed sales were up 1.5% 20168.2% and total own beer volume excluding contract was up 4.4% 2016 1.2%.
In the 9 weeks to 26 August likeforlike EDITBAR in the tenanted estate was up 0.6% 2016 2.2%.
Summary
This has been a good year for the
The underlying performance has been strong there has been a high level of pub acquisition and brand activity the quality of our operations continues to improve.
The profile of our pub assets and brands is stronger than ever.
Our investments in recent years have helped to build a highquality and sustainable platform for the future.
But the focus in the coming year is to continue the rate of investment in our core business to consolidate the recent acquisitions and effect a smooth transition in the brewing and brands business.
We have good reason to be pleased with the strategic and financial performance this year.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
This years results reflect the continued growth of our managed pub estate which has seen new pubs acquired combined with likeforlike growth ahead of the market.
The tenanted and leased operation has again delivered robust turnover and profitability with solid likeforlike growth offset by disposals of pubs that no longer fit our longterm strategy.
The brewing and brands division has delivered a level of volume growth ahead of the market underpinned by a strong and diverse brand portfolio.
The Group remains a cash generative business which combined with the strength of its balance sheet has enabled a record level of capital investment as we aim to build a stronger business for the long term benefit of shareholders.

FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
The total cash cost of interest and dividends increased by 0.2m to 8.1m 2016 7.9m.
Interest payments have risen as a result of the increase in net debt following the acquisition activity in the year.
Dividend payments reflect the increase in payment of the final 2016 and interim 2017 dividends.
In order to service the Companys future obligations under employee incentive plans 124514 shares were purchased 2016 49000 at an average market price of 13.22 2016 11.92.
Within the year 0.3m of this consideration was settled 2016 0.3m with the remaining 1.3m falling into the 2018 financial year.
Total disposal proceeds of 5.9m 2016 11.9m were realised from the sale of 15 pubs and two unlicensed properties 2016 13 pubs the land at Queen Court outside Faversham and six unlicensed properties.
Taking these items together internally generated free cash flow was lower at 19.0m 2016 23.7m due to the lower disposal proceeds.
This cash flow has been used for two purposes aligned to our longterm strategy Cash spend on core capital expenditure was 13.2m up from 10.7m in 2016 as we continue to invest to strengthen the pub and brewery asset base.
This was driven by the developments at the Minnis Bay Birchington and the Ostrich Colnbrook an increase in tenanted developments and brewery infrastructure projects.
A further 24.8m 2016 4.7m of acquisition capital expenditure was invested in three separate transactions.
Firstly at the start of the financial year both the purchase of eight freehold pubs from Ei Group plc and the purchase of UES took place at a combined cash cost of 12.9m.
Later in the year an additional 11.9m was invested in the purchase of VGR.
Financing and loan facilities As previously announced and to support the acquisition activity in the year the revolving credit facility maturing in 2020 was extended to 45m in November 2016.
This facility provides the flexibility to support our growth plans with margins above floating rate of between 130 and 260 basis points depending on the Groups leverage ratio of net debt to EBITDA.
The 20year term loan maturing in 2026 remains unchanged meaning total committed facilities of 105m are in place together with a 2m overdraft facility which is renewable in June 2018.
The floating element of interest on the 20year term loan was fixed by swap contracts to give an effective rate of interest of 5.78%.
These swap contracts are revalued annually to fair value taking into account current prevailing longterm interest rates.
The value of these derivatives at 24 June 2017 was a liability of 21.9m 2016 23.7m.
The policy for managing treasury and financial risk is as set out in note 23.
Balance sheet There was a 26.4m increase in fixed assets 2016 increase of 0.6m but a rise in net debt of 18.0m to 78.1m 2016 60.1m.
Balance sheet gearing at the year end was 41% 2016 33% and the ratio of net debt to EBITDA at the year end was 3.3 times 2016 2.8 times.
Shareholders funds at 24 June 2017 were 191.1m 2016 183.9m meaning net assets per share showed an increase of 3.9% to 12.86 2016 12.38.
2018 Financial Year The 2018 financial year will be a 53 week period to 30 June 2018 and hence will benefit from an additional trading week.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF SHEPHERD NEAME LIMITED
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the groups and of the Parent Companys affairs as at 24 June 2017 and of the groups profit for the 52 weeks then ended have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice including Financial Reporting Standard 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland and have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
We have audited the financial statements of Shepherd Neame Limited the Parent Company and its subsidiary the group which comprise the Consolidated Profit and Loss
Comprehensive Income the Consolidated Balance Sheet the Company Balance Sheet the Statement of Changes in Equity the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement the statement of accounting policies and the related notes 1 to 34.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards including Financial Reporting Standard 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice.
Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing UK ISAs UK and applicable law.
Our
We are independent of the group and the Parent Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK including the FRCs Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Summary of our audit approach Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were The fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired under FRS 102 Section 19 Business Combinations The discount rate and forecast growth rates used as part of the tangible fixed assets impairment review
The materiality used in the current year was 589000 which was determined on the basis of 5% of profit before taxation.
Scoping
We performed full scope audit procedures over the entire group.
This is the first year that a group audit has been performed due to the acquisition of Village Green Restaurants Limited that took place in the period.
Conclusions relating to going concern We are required by ISAs UK to report in respect of the following matters where the directors use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate or the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the groups or the Parent Companys ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that in our professional judgement were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement whether or not due to fraud that we identified.
These matters included those which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
The fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired under FRS 102 Section 19 Business Combinations Key audit matter description During the year the Group acquired Village Green Restaurants for a total consideration of 11.9m.
The acquisition is accounted for as a business combination.
There are a number of significant judgements involved in the determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed which also gives rise to a potential fraud risk.
We have therefore identified the valuation of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed as a significant risk of material misstatement.
A purchase price allocation exercise has been performed by Management.
The primary element of the valuation exercise assessed the fair value of the tangible fixed assets acquired as part of the combination 13.3m and the resulting goodwill 506000.
The allocation also considered the fair values of other assets and liabilities acquired.
Refer to the accounting policies page 44 and note 16 of the group financial statements page 57.
How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter We verified the appropriateness of the groups accounting for the acquisition of Village Green Restaurants through use of the following key procedures Challenged the groups preliminary estimates of fair value to test their robustness by checking completeness of the Companys process to identify the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and checking internal consistency of the assumptions used in the valuations Obtained the groups internal experts reports supporting the value of the properties acquired and used our real estate specialists to verify the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and the reasonableness of key assumptions and judgements made Evaluated the competence of the experts used by the group and our inhouse experts by reference to their qualifications and experience Assessed and challenged key assumptions and judgements used in the valuation of the property assets acquired including the valuation multiples and EBITDAs used for each property acquired.
These were challenged through use of our real estate specialists engaging with management in detailed discussions around each property valuation 38 Shepherd Neame annual report and accounts 2017
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF SHEPHERD NEAME LIMITED CONTINUED Engaged with our audit specialists to assess the reasonableness of the deferred tax liabilities calculated on the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired Reviewed the disclosures in the financial statements around the acquisitions to confirm the fair values of the assets and liabilities have been correctly recorded Challenged that the Management judgements underpinning the goodwill amortisation periods were appropriate and Reviewed sale and purchase agreements to identify any contingent or deferred consideration.
Key observations On the basis of the assessment we have carried out in respect of the valuations we are satisfied with the approach and methodology adopted by the Directors in the preparation of the valuations of their estate as at 24 June 2017.
We believe that the valuations are a fair and reasonable reflection of the business combination as at that date.
The discount rate and forecast growth rates used as part of the tangible fixed assets impairment review Key audit matter description The Group has property plant and equipment with a net book value of 299m as at 24 June 2017.
In assessing impairment Management estimates the recoverable amount of each cashgenerating unit CGU by reference to the higher of its value in use based on the groups key assumptions in relation to future profits and a discount rate and fair value less costs of disposal.
The recoverable amount is compared to the carrying value of each CGU to determine whether any impairment is required.
A CGU is defined as an individual tenanted or managed public house because this is the lowest level at which a group of assets in this case the land buildings and fixtures and fittings generate independent cash inflows.
There is a significant element of judgement in determining the recoverable amount of assets specifically the assumptions used by Management in the value in use calculations which also gives rise to a potential fraud risk.
The discount rate and EBITDA growth rates are impacted by various factors both internal as well as wider external economic factors inflationary pressures tax levies consumer demand.
The discount rate and forecast profit calculations therefore have a high degree of judgement and carry a higher level of inherent risk of material error.
These areas therefore formed a significant risk for our audit purposes.
Refer to accounting policies page 44 and note 14 of the group financial statements page 54.
How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter We obtained an understanding of the groups process employed to identify impairment indicators and to calculate appropriate impairments of property plant and equipment at a cashgenerating unit level.
We then performed the following procedures in order to address the above significant risk Engaged our valuation specialists to benchmark discount rates against market data and competitors and also performed sensitivity analysis using our specialists discount rate thresholds T ested the arithmetical accuracy and integrity of the model Challenged Managements growth forecasts and assumptions used through detailed discussions with Management and a retrospective review of budget accuracy and historic growth Reviewed and challenged Managements assessment of where impairment indicators trigger the need for impairment testing while challenging Managements value in use calculations and assumptions for pubs requiring impairment tests.
This included those deemed at risk which are those pubs that have had three years of decreasing EBITDA andor three years where the ROCE falls below 8% Reviewed and followed up the at risk properties identified as part of the 2016 impairment review to note whether these were still deemed to be at risk of impairment and Evaluated the appropriateness sufficiency and clarity of any impairment related disclosures provided in the group financial statements including the disclosure of key sensitivities.
Key observations We are satisfied Managements assumptions in growth rates discount rate and the overall impairment review performed are reasonable.
Our application of materiality We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced.
We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
Based on our professional judgement we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows Group materiality Basis for determining materiality 5% of profit before taxation Rationale for the benchmark applied We judged profit before taxation to be the most appropriate benchmark for determining materiality as it is a key performance indicator for various stakeholders including shareholders.

Audit Committee Reporting threshold 20000  StrategicReport Governance Financial Statements OtherInformation 39 site We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of 20000 as well as differences below that threshold that in our view warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit The Groups operations are all conducted in the United Kingdom.
The audit was performed by one audit team based in the head office location in Faversham.
The
Group is made up of Shepherd Neame Limited the Parent Company and Village Green Restaurants Limited which is a wholly owned subsidiary.
We also attended a sample of stock counts as at the year end.
During the year the Parent Company acquired control of Village Green Restaurants.
We obtained a thorough understanding of the entitylevel controls of the Group.
This assisted us in identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement due to fraud or error and supported us in determining the most appropriate audit strategy.
We performed an audit of the complete financial information of all trading components which represented 100% of the Groups results for the year.
Other information The directors are responsible for the other information.
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report other than the financial statements and our auditors report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements our responsibility is to read the other information and in doing so consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information.
If based on the work we have performed we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Responsibilities of directors As explained more fully in the directors responsibilities statement the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements the directors are responsible for assessing the groups and Parent Companys ability to continue as a going concern disclosing as applicable matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the Parent Company or to cease operations or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditors report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs UK will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if individually or in the aggregate they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit for the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Councils website at www. rc. auditorsresponsibilities.
This description forms part of our auditors report.
Use of our report This report is made solely to the Companys members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Companys members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors report and for no other purpose.
T o the fullest extent permitted by law we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Companys members as a body for our audit work for this report or for the opinions we have formed.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 In our opinion based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit the information given in the strategic report and the directors report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements and the strategic report and the directors report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and or the Parent Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit we have not identified any material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors report.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if in our opinion we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit or adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us or the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors remuneration Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of directors remuneration have not been made.
We have nothing to report in respect of this matter.

Shepherd Neame Limited the Company is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act.
The Company is a private company limited by shares and is registered in England and Wales.
The registered office is 17 Court Street Faversham Kent ME13 7AX.
The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries the Group and the nature of the Groups operations are set out in the Directors report on page 35.
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention modified to include certain items at fair value and by the revaluation of freehold licensed and associated properties.
They are prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 FRS 102 issued by the Financial Reporting Council.
The functional currency of the Company is considered to be pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates.
The financial statements are also presented in pounds sterling rounded to the nearest thousand 000 unless otherwise stated.
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings made up to 24 June 2017.
A subsidiary is an entity that is controlled by the parent.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold are consolidated for the periods from or to the date on which control passed.
Business combinations are accounted for under the purchase method.
Where necessary adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intragroup transactions balances income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
In the parent financial statements investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less impairment.
Goodwill arising on acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses representing any excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired is capitalised and written off on a straightline basis over its useful economic life which is five to ten years.
Provision is made for any impairment.
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost or valuation net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Licensed freehold properties were revalued on transition to FRS 102 with fair value treated as deemed cost.
Assets under construction are not depreciated until they are brought into use.
All other tangible assets are depreciated at varying rates calculated to write off their carrying value less estimated residual value evenly over their expected useful lives as follows Freehold brewery buildings 25 years Other freehold and long leasehold buildings 50 years Short leaseholds over the lease term Other plant equipment fixtures and vehicles 3 to 20 years Computer hardware and software 3 to 10 years Residual value represents the estimated amount which would currently be obtained from disposal of an asset after deducting estimated costs of disposal if the asset were already of the age and in the condition expected at the end of its useful life.
Investment properties are carried at fair value and measured at each reporting date with any change recognised in the profit and loss account.
Fixed asset investments are measured at cost less impairment.
The carrying values of the fixed asset investments are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
StrategicReport Governance Financial Statements OtherInformation 45 site i Financial assets and liabilities All financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at transaction price including transaction costs except for those financial assets classified as at fair value through profit or loss which are initially measured at fair value which is normally the transaction price excluding transaction costs unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction.
If an arrangement constitutes a financing transaction the financial asset or financial liability is measured at the present value of the future payments discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument.
Debt instruments are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Debt instruments that are classified as payable or receivable within one year on initial recognition and which meet certain conditions are measured at the undiscounted amount of the cash or other consideration expected to be paid or received net of impairment.
Financial assets are derecognised when and only when a the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or are settled b the Group transfers to another party substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset or c the Group despite having retained some but not all significant risks and rewards of ownership has transferred control of the asset to another party.
Financial liabilities are derecognised only when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged cancelled or expires.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments interest rate swaps to adjust interest rate exposures.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each reporting date.
At the inception of the hedge relationship the economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item is documented along with the risk management objectives and clear identification of the risk in the hedged item that is being hedged by the hedging instrument.
Furthermore at the inception of the hedge the Company determines and documents causes for hedge ineffectiveness.
The interest rate swaps are classified as cash flow hedges because the derivative financial instruments hedge the variable interest rate risk of the cash flows associated with the recognised debt instrument measured at amortised cost the 60m longterm loan to 2026.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the designated hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income.
The gain or loss relating to any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods in which the hedged item affects profit or loss or when the hedging relationship ends.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship the hedging instrument expires or is sold terminated or exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Any gain or loss accumulated in equity at that time is reclassified to profit or loss when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur any gain or loss that was recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified immediately to profit or loss.
Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to sell which is equivalent to the net realisable value.
Cost of own beers produced includes materials and directly attributable fixed and variable production overheads.
Cost is calculated using the average cost method.
Provision is made for obsolete slowmoving or defective items where appropriate.
Rentals payable and receivable under operating leases are charged on a straightline basis over the lease term even if the payments are not made on such a basis.
Assets other than those measured at fair value are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
If there is objective evidence of impairment an impairment loss is recognised in the profit and loss account as described below.
Nonfinancial assets An asset is impaired where there is objective evidence that as a result of one or more events that occurred after initial recognition the estimated recoverable value of the asset has been reduced.
The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
Where indicators exist for a decrease in impairment loss the prior impairment loss is tested to determine reversal.
An impairment loss is reversed on an individual impaired asset to the extent that the revised recoverable value does not lead to a revised carrying amount higher than the carrying value had no impairment been recognised.
46 Shepherd Neame annual report and accounts 2017 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 24 June 2017 1 Accounting Policies continued Financial assets For financial assets carried at amortised cost the amount of an impairment is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate.
For financial assets carried at cost less impairment the impairment loss is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the best estimate of the amount that would be received for the asset if it were to be sold at the reporting date.
Where indicators exist for a decrease in impairment loss and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised the prior impairment loss is tested to determine reversal.
An impairment loss is reversed on an individual impaired financial asset to the extent that the revised recoverable value does not lead to a revised carrying amount higher than the carrying value had no impairment been recognised.
Current tax Corporation tax payable is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that will result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that on the basis of all available evidence it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse based on the tax rate and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax relating to property plant and equipment measured using the revaluation model and investment property is measured using the tax rates and allowances that apply to sale of the asset.
The tax expense or income is presented in the same component of comprehensive income or equity as the transaction or other event that resulted in the tax expense or income.
Turnover is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer usually on dispatch or delivery of the goods or on provision of services.
Turnover comprises the invoice value of goods inclusive of excise duty and services net of VAT and discounts.
Rental income received from tied estate properties is recognised in the period in which it arises on an accruals basis or for leased properties on a straightline basis over the term of the lease.
Items which are either material or infrequent in nature are described as exceptional items and are excluded from underlying results.
The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes.
Contributions are charged to the profit and loss account as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the schemes.
Other longterm employee benefits are measured at the present value of the benefit obligation at the financial reporting date.
Transactions expressed in foreign currencies are translated into sterling and recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at rates of exchange prevailing at that date.
All differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Dividends payable are shown as a movement in reserves when declared interim dividend or approved final dividend.
StrategicReport Governance Financial Statements OtherInformation 47 site q Sharebased payment All options are equitysettled.
The cost of equitysettled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award.
Fair value is determined using the BlackScholes pricing model which is considered by management to be the most appropriate method of valuation.
In valuing equitysettled transactions no account is taken of any vesting conditions other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Group market conditions.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due to marketbased conditions not achieving the threshold for vesting.
At each balance sheet date before vesting the cumulative expense is calculated representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and managements best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of nonmarket conditions.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet is recognised in the profit and loss account with a corresponding entry in equity.
The Company recognises its investment in subsidiaries at cost.
Income is recognised from these investments only in relation to distributions received from postacquisition profits.
Distributions received in excess of postacquisition profits are deducted from the cost of the investment.
2 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the application of the Groups accounting policies which are described in note 1 the Directors are required to make judgements estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Key source of estimation uncertainty  impairment of assets Financial and nonfinancial assets are subject to impairment reviews at the balance sheet date based on whether current or future events and circumstances suggest that their recoverable amount may be less than their carrying value.
Recoverable amount is based on the higher of the value in use and fair value less costs to dispose.
Value in use is calculated from expected future cash flows using suitable discount rates and includes management assumptions and estimates of future performance as disclosed in note 14.
Critical judgements There have been no critical judgements made in the current or prior financial years.
48 Shepherd Neame annual report and accounts 2017 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 24 June 2017 3 Segmental reporting In adopting FRS 102 the operating segment disclosure requirements of IFRS 8 are required as the Group has publicly traded equity instruments.
The accounting policy for identifying segments is based on internal management reporting information that is regularly reviewed by the chief operating decisionmaker.
The Group has three operating segments which are largely organised and managed separately according to the nature of the products and services provided and the profile of the customers Brewing and Brands which comprises the brewing marketing and sales of beer wine and spirits Managed Pubs and Hotels and Tenanted and Leased Pubs which comprises pubs operated by third parties under tenancy or lease agreements.
Transfer prices between operating segments are set on an arms length basis.
The measurement policies the Group uses for segment reporting under IFRS 8 are the same as those used in the financial statements.

The main impact was the reduction of the UK Corporation tax rate from 18% to 17% effective from 1 April 2020.
To the extent that this rate change will affect the amount of future tax cash tax payments to be made by the Group this will reduce the size of both the Groups deferred tax liability and tax asset.
The impact in the 52 weeks to 24 June 2017 was an exceptional credit to profit and loss of 315000 and a credit to other comprehensive income of 146000.
During the 53 weeks beginning 25 June 2017 the net reduction of deferred tax liabilities expected to be credited to the profit and loss account is estimated at 800000 due to the reversal of accelerated capital allowances and reduction in the deferred tax liability on the revaluation of freehold pubs.
This estimate is based upon a number of assumptions including the level of capital expenditure qualifying for capital allowances properties that are to be sold and increases in the Retail Price Index which are uncertain and could result in a significantly different actual movement.
There is no expiry date on timing differences.

A net impairment loss of 199000 was recognised in the year in respect of two licensed properties to write them down to their recoverable amount 2016 307000 in respect of six licensed properties.
The loss arose as a result of a decline in performance at these properties.
Impairment was assessed at the incomegenerating unit level considered to be on the basis of each individual pub.
Whether an asset was impaired or not was determined by comparing the carrying value against its estimated recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount was taken as the higher of either the net realisable value or its value in use.
The value in use was determined by conducting a net present value review of all relevant cash flows from the asset based upon the budget for the forthcoming financial year approved by the Directors.
Cash flows beyond the budget period are extrapolated in perpetuity for freehold properties and over the length of the remaining lease for leasehold properties.
The longterm growth rates applied are 2.5% for managed pubs and 1.5% for tenanted pubs.
The pretax discount rate used in this review was 8.13% 2016 8.16%.
Impairments and reversal of impairments of fixed assets are included in operating charges excluded from underlying results.
Investment properties which are all freehold are revalued to fair value at each reporting date by the Companys own professionally qualified staff.
The valuations were performed by a Company director who is RICS qualified.
An independent valuation of the properties has not been performed.
The fair values for commercial property and land are based on the rental income earned on the properties and average yields earned on comparable properties from publicly available information and for residential properties on comparable market evidence.

Under the terms of the swaps the Group receives floating rate interest and pays fixed rate interest.
The fair values for interest rate swaps are a volatile value often referred to as mark to market value.
This value is determined by marking the fixed rate within the swap against the market for forward interest rates.
If forward interest rates are below the fixed swap rate then the swap will have a negative fair value for the Group.
If forward interest rates are above the swap rate then there will be a positive fair value for the Group.

23 Financial Risk Management
The main risks associated with the Groups financial assets and liabilities are interest rate risk liquidity risk counterparty credit risk and foreign currency risk as noted below.
The policies for managing these risks are regularly reviewed and agreed by the Board of Directors.
In certain limited circumstances the Group uses derivative instruments to change the economic characteristics of its financial instruments.
It is Group policy not to enter into or trade in financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Interest rate risk Currently it is Group policy to manage the cost of its borrowings by using a mixture of fixed and variable interest rates at the balance sheet date.
Debt is represented by a 20year term loan a fiveyear revolving credit facility and a shortterm committed overdraft facility all of which are secured by a first floating charge over the assets of the Group.
They all bear interest at variable rates based on LIBOR and National Westminster Bank base rate.
The interest on the rate subject to bank margin of 60m available under the 20year term bank loan is fixed by means of interest rate swap contracts which run for the same period as the loan as disclosed in notes 21 and 22.
Interest on drawings on the revolving credit facility and shortterm overdraft facility are not fixed as it is Group policy to have shortterm borrowing on a variable rate basis.
Liquidity risk The Group manages its liquidity risk by monitoring cash receipts and payments and preparing rolling cash flow forecasts from which to predict short and longterm funding requirements and ensure that borrowing facilities are available if required and that covenants in respect of bank loans are not contravened.
Capital expenditure is approved by the Board and investment appraisal models used to evaluate proposed expenditure.
It is currently the Groups policy to finance the majority of its business need by means of longterm bank loans which amounted to 60m fully drawn at the year end.
The balance of its requirements at the balance sheet date was provided by a fiveyear revolving credit loan facility of 45m which is due to mature in September 2020 and a committed overdraft facility of 2m which matures in June 2018.
The size of the facility is regularly reviewed and the overdraft facility is renewed annually.
At the year end 19m 2016 nil of the revolving credit loan facility and nil 2016 0.7m of the overdraft facility was being utilised.
Counterparty credit risk The Group trades only with recognised creditworthy third parties.
It is the Groups policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures and are subject to credit limits to control debt exposure.
It has not been possible to maintain credit insurance at appropriate cost in the current market.
In addition receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis.
The growth of the Groups business with national retailers has increased the concentration of credit risk.
However the Board of Directors consider that the credit risk from these customers remains relatively low.
With respect to credit risk arising from other financial assets of the Group which comprise cash and cash equivalents the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from the default of a counterparty with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying value amount of these instruments.
Foreign currency risk The principal financial instruments are denominated in sterling and the vast majority of the Groups operations are undertaken within the UK.
Consequently the foreign currency risk is immaterial except for importation of product and those infrequent occasions when the Group purchases plant and equipment denominated in foreign currency.
In these circumstances it is the policy of the Group to consider entering into forward exchange contracts to fix future payments as they fall due.
At the year end the Group had no outstanding contracts to purchase foreign currency.
The capital structure of the Group consists of bank loans see note 20 cash and shareholders equity comprising share capital reserves and retained earnings see notes 25 and 26.
In managing its capital the Groups main objectives are to ensure that it is able to continue to operate as a going concern as noted in the Report of the Directors and to maximise its return to its shareholders through a combination of capital growth and distributions.
The Group seeks to maintain a ratio of debt to equity that balances the risk and returns at an acceptable level and maintains sufficient funds to meet its working capital and investment requirements and comply with banklending covenants.
The Board of Directors review the Groups dividend policy and funding requirements regularly throughout the year.

The Company is in dispute regarding the terms on which a longterm agreement with our local water company terminated and any residual liabilities under it owed by the Company.
The Board is of the view that there should be no material liability for the Group in this respect beyond charges yet to be invoiced in line with the contract for the final four years which terminated in April 2015.
The Group has made accruals in respect of these amounts.
The dispute resolution procedure in the longterm agreement is arbitration.
In the absence of a consensual resolution to this dispute there is a possibility that arbitration could commence.
It is estimated that the Groups legal and associated costs of an arbitration case could be up to 750000.
The Group would seek to reclaim these costs as part of the arbitration process.

All schemes are equitysettled.
All disclosure relates to both Group and Company.
The Shepherd Neame Employee Share Incentive Plan SIP is open to all employees with 18 months service at the award date.
A free award of shares based on length of service and salary and subject to the maximum of 3600 was made to all eligible employees in all years from 2003 to 2016 with the exception of 2009.
Participants are entitled to these free shares from three years after the date of the award if they remain in the Companys employment.
The Company did not purchase any shares for the Employee Share Incentive Plan in either 2017 or 2016.
The following table illustrates the number and movements in shares in the year
Number
Outstanding shares at start of year Granted during the year Forfeited during the year Distributed during the year Outstanding shares at end of year Distributable at end of year The employees do not have to make any payment for the award of shares under the Plan.
As such the weighted average exercise price is nil.
The weighted average share price at date of distribution for the shares distributed was 12.954 2016 11.740.
The weighted average fair value of the shares granted in November 2016 was 12.650 November 2015 11.950.
The fair value taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the shares were granted equates to the market price at the date of grant.
The expense recognised for sharebased payments made under SIP in respect of employee services during the year to 24 June 2017 was 237000 2016 200000.
This is a restricted share scheme for Senior Managers and Executive Directors including the highest paid Director and four other
The scheme ended in 2015.
Under the 2005 restricted share scheme primary options were awarded which are exercisable three years after they were awarded subject normally to the grantee remaining in the Companys employment.
The Directors were also granted secondary options which are exercisable three years after they were awarded if the Group achieves certain financial performance criteria and normally provided that the Director remains in the Companys employment.
The contractual life of each option granted is ten years and the options outstanding at 24 June 2017 had a remaining contractual life of 6.97 years.

The fair value of the equitysettled share options granted under the scheme is estimated at the date of grant using the BlackScholes option pricing model which is considered by management to be the most appropriate method of valuation.
In valuing equitysettled transactions no account is taken of any vesting conditions other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company market conditions.
