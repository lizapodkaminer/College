OVERVIEW
Helicals core business is developing and owning dynamic well located office space in London and Manchester and also includes a portfolio of logistics units along the motorway network of England and Wales.
With intelligent stock selection we aim to maximise returns by development and refurbishment as well as through significant asset management initiatives.
THE
LONDON
MARKET
In our judgement the London commercial property market currently provides the best source of potential capital profits and we expect this to remain the case for the foreseeable future notwithstanding the risks associated with our exit from the European Union and other potential headwinds.
In order for Helical to generate capital profits the Company needs to identify those areas where it believes tenant demand is or will become strong and to source opportunities in those areas at an appropriate entry price.
Using the skills knowledge and expertise gained over many years the Helical team aims to deliver attractive and exciting office space in locations with growing tenant demand.
The Company has recognised three continuing major developments in the London office market.
First the growth of the London population which exceeded its previous peak during 2015.
Second the continuing and rapid expansion of the creative industries predominantly in technology and media.
Third the migration of occupiers from the West End to the City and East London.
Londons population reached 8.7 million in 2015 exceeding its previous peak in 1939 and is forecast to continue growing towards 10 million by 2030.
Whilst this growth will present challenges to London particularly in terms of its infrastructure the opening of the Elizabeth Line Crossrail at the end of 2018 will assist in alleviating these problems.
Our properties in the City and Tech Belt are all in locations that will benefit from this rail link.
Recently published research by CBRE noted that the UK is a global leader in the creative industries and we have targeted these industries with our portfolio.
In
London companies involved in media advertising and marketing technology and other creative industries comprised 54% of our new lettings in the year to 31 March 2017.
The third factor influencing our choice of location for our portfolio is the migration of occupiers across central London to the City and East London.
The desire to be part of creative hubs surrounded by likeminded individuals located a short travelling distance from home is a common theme in discussing requirements with tenants.
Most obviously those hubs are in the Tech Belt from Kings Cross to Whitechapel.
In London Helical is building up a portfolio of multitenanted office buildings in the Tech Belt locations of Farringdon the Old Street roundabout and Whitechapel and also in West London from Chiswick to Shepherds
By owning these clusters or villages of office buildings it has a portfolio of assets with multiple lease events leading to ongoing asset management opportunities.
The Company also seeks to expand its profitability by taking on additional schemes in Central London either by coinvestment or by forward selling funding them to allow for the generation of profit shares and development management fees but with reduced balance sheet exposure.
IN LONDON 54% of our new lettings in the year to 31 March 2017 were to companies involved in media advertising and marketing technology and other creative industries.

THE
REGIONAL
MARKET
LOOKING
FORWARD
Outside London the Company has identified two key areas that contribute the potential for capital growth and are a source of recurring net rental income at good yields.
In Manchester we now have four assets one acquired post yearend with a potential capital value after all refurbishment works and lettings are concluded approaching 100m.
Here the occupational and investment market continues to strengthen.
The city has high quality office stock and a diverse occupier base which has seen much international and institutional investment over the past few years.
Companies have access to a deep and highly skilled talent pool in a cost effective location both for the employer and the employee.
Recent research by CBRE identified Manchester as the leading UK creative location outside London by some margin and our buildings are designed to attract creative occupiers.
Annual office take up is consistently in excess of 1m sq ft with high profile new occupiers coming to the city on a frequent basis.
In addition we have a portfolio of logistics units comprising 15% of our investment portfolio but which contribute 25% of our current contracted rents.
This sector is characterised by strong occupational demand and limited available supply.
These properties have little obsolescence and good prospects of rental growth.
The key areas of focus going forward for Helical are London Manchester offices and logistics units.
All other assets currently held are regarded as noncore and we will seek to continue to exit those assets as the opportunities to do so arise.
Our ambition is to have a balanced portfolio which generates sufficient net rental income to exceed all of our recurring costs and provide a surplus significantly greater than our annual dividend to shareholders.
We have an ERV on the portfolio post recent sales of 69m and expect to generate this surplus once all of our current asset management initiatives are completed.
We also seek a pipeline of opportunities to grow the balance sheet of Helical through the creation of development profits and capital surpluses.

GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION STRATEGIC REPORT HELICAL PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 15 I am pleased to present the Companys 2017 Annual Results the first since my appointment as Chief Executive of Helical plc at the 2016 AGM.
EPRA NAV INCREASE 3.7% to 473p EPRA EPS RENTAL INCOME 8.3% to 47.0m INCREASE IN TOTAL DIVIDEND 5.3% TOTAL PROPERTY RETURN IPD PROPERTY RETURN 9.4% GERALD KA YE CHIEF EXECUTIVE
The year to 31 March 2017 has been eventful with the real estate sector proving resilient against a background of both UK and international political change.
Looking back 12 months it was clear that the exceptional growth in property values that we experienced over the period from 2012 to 2016 as the market recovered from the 2008 Global Financial Crisis was coming to an end with yields approaching historic lows but with some prospect for growth in rental values.
At Helical we took advantage of the strong recovery in property values during this period by expanding the Companys business activities investing in development opportunities in London and higher yielding regional assets to provide a stable flow of rental income.
Using the proceeds of our 2013 Retail Bond and our 2014 Convertible Bond together with additional borrowings we increased our property portfolio from 626m at 31 March 2013 to over 1.2bn generating significant surpluses which have more than doubled shareholders funds from 254m to 517m at 31 March 2017.
During the year we have sought to recycle some of the capital created in this period into the schemes which we believe will continue to support the future growth of the Company.
We have narrowed the focus of the Company to London offices in Manchester and a portfolio of logistics units.
We expect to complete this process during the current year with the sale of the remaining noncore assets being the retail properties and regional offices outside of Manchester whilst continuing to work through the retirement village programme.
HELICAL PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 16 CHIEF EXECUTIVES STATEMENT In the year under review the majority of our performance has come from the assets we own in London where we have increased our weighting to 63% of the total portfolio.
Sales of regional assets since the year end have increased this London weighting further to 66%.
In the investment portfolio we have created buildings which reflect the needs of our tenants acknowledging that modern lifestyles increasingly merge work and leisure needs.
We now have a portfolio of multilet flexible and desirable properties which also provide ongoing asset management opportunities to add value.
Our London portfolio remains reversionary with further value to be created through the completion of our redevelopment and refurbishment programme letting vacant space and upcoming rent reviews.
We believe that London will continue to outperform the rest of the UK over the medium and long term and our strategy is to continue to increase our London holdings.
RESULTS FOR THE YEAR The profit before tax for the year to 31 March 2017 was 41.6m 2016 114.0m.
Total Property Return reduced to 79.9m 2016 164.6m and included growing net rents of 47.0m an increase of 8.3% on 2016 43.4m and development losses of 5.7m 2016 profit of 27.5m after deducting provisions of 12.8m 2016 6.4m.
The gain on sale and revaluation of the investment portfolio contributed 38.6m 2016 93.7m.
Net finance costs of 21.2m were lower than in 2016 22.6m and the Income Statement benefited from the shortening of the maturity period for the Groups remaining interest rate swaps which led to a 0.8m credit 2016 charge of 6.9m arising from the valuation of the Companys derivative financial instruments.
The revaluation of the Companys Convertible Bond provided a credit of 3.0m 2016 0.5m.
Recurring administration costs were marginally higher at 10.8m 2016 10.7m.
Performance related awards were substantially lower at 6.9m 2016 13.3m with National Insurance on these awards of 0.7m 2016 2.1m.
These results allow the Board to continue its progressive dividend policy and to recommend to Shareholders a final dividend of 6.20p which together with the interim dividend of 2.40p paid in December 2016 takes the total dividend for the year to 8.60p 2016 8.17p an overall increase of 5.3%.
PERFORMANCE
We measure our performance at both portfolio and Company level seeking to outperform the relevant sector indices and our peer group in the medium and long term.
EPRA earnings per share fell from 17.1p to 0.5p reflecting growing net rental income offset by reduced development profits.
On a likeforlike basis the investment portfolio increased by 5.2% 4.5% including sales and purchases.
Sales during the year offset this growth in values contributing to an overall reduction in the portfolio value to 1205m 2016 1240m.
The unleveraged return of our property portfolio as measured by IPD was 9.4% 2016 21.7% compared to 4.4% 2016 11.4% for the benchmark index.
These investment gains contributed to an increase in EPRA net asset value per share up 3.7% to 473p 2016 456p.
FINANCE
The Company has expanded its activities significantly in recent years seeking to increase shareholder funds through the generation and retention of increased net rental streams development profits and valuation surpluses.
This growth has been financed through an increase in secured debt borrowed primarily from UK high street banks and since 2013 through the use of unsecured debt in the form of a Retail Bond and a Convertible Bond.
In assessing the needs of the business the Company is conscious that it needs to manage any risks inherent in this leveraged approach to growing the business.
It seeks to do this through the use of unsecured debt 24% of total debt by maintaining an appropriate debt maturity profile and by hedging its interest rate exposure.
The Company uses gearing on a tactical basis throughout the property cycle being raised to accentuate property performance when property returns are judged to materially outperform the cost of debt and lowered when seeking to reduce exposure to the property cycle.
At 31 March 2017 the Companys seethrough loan to value LTV being the ratio of seethrough net borrowings to the value of the seethrough property portfolio was 51%.
This metric has varied between 45% and 55% in the last five years and subsequent to the year end has fallen below 50% following the recent sales of properties in Cardiff and Great Yarmouth.
Looking forward the Company will seek to operate within an LTV range of 40%50% for the foreseeable future subject to being able to maximise opportunities in the market whilst remaining aware of the risks of higher levels of gearing.
During the year the average debt maturity reduced to 3.6 years 2016 4.5 years with no secured loan repayable before November 2019 whilst marginally increasing the average cost of debt at 4.3% 2016 4.2%.
The Company has a significant level of liquidity with cash and unutilised bank facilities of 267m 2016 193m to fund capital works on its portfolio.
BOARD MATTERS In July 2016 I became CEO of Helical plc succeeding Michael Slade who became the Companys NonExecutive Chairman.
The Board also consists of three Executive Directors and five Independent NonExecutive Directors.
Our Executive team has an average of over 19 years experience at Helical and are supported by a strong team of property and finance professionals and administrative staff.
THE FUTURE Helical has a dynamic portfolio with good upside potential through a combination of development refurbishment and significant asset management opportunities.
We believe our concentration on offices and mixed use assets in London offices in Manchester and well located logistics units will provide capital growth from development gains and rising income streams.
We have ambition to continue to grow the Company and have actively sought to add to our development pipeline with exciting new schemes particularly in
Rebalancing the portfolio through the sale of noncore assets enables us to recycle some of the capital we have created in recent years and fully pursue those opportunities that we have identified.

IPD Benchmark EPRA NET ASSET VALUE COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH RATE 3 YEARS
The Investment Property Databank IPD produces a number of independent benchmarks of property returns which are regarded as the main industry indices.
IPD has compared the unleveraged performance of Helicals total property portfolio against portfolios within IPD for the last 20 years.
The Groups annual performance target is to exceed the top quartile of the IPD database which it has consistently achieved.
PERFORMANCE
Helicals unleveraged performance for the year to 31 March 2017 was 9.4% 2016 21.7% compared to the IPD benchmark of 4.4% 2016 11.4% and upper quartile benchmark of 6.9% 2016 13.0%.
LINK TO REMUNERATION Performance Share Plan A third of the PSP vesting criteria is based on performance compared with the IPD so these awards are directly linked to this performance measure.
DESCRIPTION
Our Groups main objective is to maximise growth in net asset value which we seek to achieve through increases in investment portfolio values and from retained earnings from other property related activity.
EPRA net asset value per share is the property industrys preferred measure of the share of net assets attributable to each share as it includes the fair value of net assets on an ongoing longterm basis.
The adjustments to net asset value to arrive at this figure are shown in note 32 to the financial statements.
PERFORMANCE
The diluted net asset value per share excluding trading stock surplus at 31 March 2017 increased by 6.4% to 431p 2016 405p.
Including
31 March 2017 increased by 3.7% to 473p 2016 456p.
LINK TO REMUNERATION Director Bonuses The calculation of the Directors bonuses under the Annual Bonus Scheme 2016 is based on a model where Directors share in the profits generated by the Companys property activities.
As these are the same profits that drive increases in EPRA NAV the Directors bonus is strongly aligned to this performance measure.
Performance Share Plan A third of the Performance Share Plan PSP vesting criteria is based on compound growth in net asset value NAV over three years so these awards are directly linked to this performance measure.
We measure our performance using a number of financial and nonfinancial key performance indicators KPIs.

DESCRIPTION
Total Shareholder Return is a measure of the return on investment for shareholders.
It combines share price appreciation and dividends paid to show the total return to the Shareholder expressed as an annualised percentage.
PERFORMANCE
The Total Shareholder Return in the year to 31 March 2017 was 18.0% 2016 1.0%.
Over
Total Shareholder Return exceeded that of the Listed Real Estate Sector Index.
LINK TO REMUNERATION Performance Share Plan A third of the PSP vesting criteria is based on performance against the FTSE 350 Super Sector Real Estate Index excluding storage companies and agencies.
These awards are therefore directly linked to this performance measure.
DESCRIPTION
High levels of staff retention remain a key feature of Helicals business.
The Group retains a highly skilled and experienced team.
We assess our success based on two key metrics the average length of service of the Groups head office employees and average staff turnover.
PERFORMANCE
The average length of service of the Groups head office employees at 31 March 2017 was eight years and the average staff turnover was 5.7%.
LINK TO REMUNERATION Director Bonuses Under the rules of the Annual Bonus Scheme 2016 a third of the bonuses are settled in deferred shares which are required to be held for a period of three years.
Performance Share Plan These awards have a three year vesting period and the Directors are required to hold them for a further two years after they vest.
We incentivise management to outperform the Groups competitors by setting appropriate levels for performance indicators against which rewards are measured.
We also design our remuneration packages to align managements interests with shareholders aspirations.
Key to this is the monitoring and reporting against identifiable performance targets and benchmarks.

In measuring and reporting on the financial performance of the Groups activities the Group uses a number of alternative performance measures APMs to ensure that these financial statements reflect such performance on a basis consistent with that used by management to monitor and assess the Groups property portfolio and to facilitate comparisons with other companies in the real estate sector.
Since 2010 Helical has held a significant proportion of its property assets in joint ventures with partners that provide the majority of the equity required to purchase the assets whilst relying on the Group to provide asset management or development expertise.
Accounting convention requires Helical to account under IFRS for our share of the net results and net assets of joint ventures in limited detail in the income statement and balance sheet.
In this review and elsewhere in this statement we have incorporated the separate components of such joint ventures into a more detailed seethrough analysis of our property portfolio and debt profile and the associated income streams and financing costs to assist in providing a more comprehensive overview of the Groups activities.
This seethrough analysis can be found in Appendix 1.
Helical is a member of the European Public Real Estate Association EPRA a body which aims through its best practice recommendations to make the financial statements of public real estate companies clearer more transparent and comparable across Europe.
Earnings reported in the income statement as required under IFRS do not provide HELICAL PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 48 FINANCIAL REVIEW TOTAL ACCOUNTING RETURN %tel 2014 2013 TOTAL PROPERTY RETURN mtel 2014 2013 KEY PERFORMANCE INDICA TORS OUR BUSINESS MODEL stakeholders with the most relevant information on the operating performance of the underlying property portfolio of real estate companies.
A key measure of a companys operational performance and the extent to which its dividend payments to shareholders are underpinned by earnings is the level of recurring income arising from operational activities.
Unrealised changes in valuation gains or losses on disposals of properties and certain other items do not necessarily provide an accurate picture of the Companys underlying operational performance and are therefore excluded from the EPRA performance measures.
Net asset value is a key performance measure used in the real estate industry.
However net asset value as reported in the financial statements under IFRS does not provide stakeholders with the most relevant information on the fair value of the assets and liabilities within an ongoing real estate investment company with a longterm investment strategy.
The objective of the EPRA NAV measure is to highlight the fair value of net assets on an ongoing longterm basis.
Assets and liabilities that are not expected to crystallise in normal circumstances such as the fair value of financial derivatives and deferred taxes on property valuation surpluses are therefore excluded.
Similarly trading properties and developments are adjusted to their fair value under the EPRA measure.
RESULTS FOR THE YEAR The year to 31 March 2017 saw the Group deliver continued growth in net rental income and a valuation surplus on the investment portfolio leading to pretax profit of 41.6m and an increase in EPRA net asset value per share of 3.7%.
The proposed final dividend of 6.20p takes the total dividend for the year to 8.60p a 5.3% increase on the previous year.
With growing rents from our core London portfolio supported by strong income streams from the regional portfolio the Company aims to continue to grow this dividend.
The Groups real estate portfolio including its share of assets held in joint ventures reduced to 1205m 2016 1240m as gains from its annual revaluation and capital expenditure on the investment portfolio and development programme were offset by the sale of 199m of assets.
There were no purchases of new investment trading or development assets during the year.
The sale of investment assets during the year has resulted in a reduction in the Groups loan to value to 51% 2016 55% which has been reduced further since the year end to 49% on a proforma basis following the sale of 65m of assets and the purchase of one asset for 13m.
The
Groups debt maturity profile shortened to 3.6 years 2016 4.5 years and its weighted average cost of debt increased to 4.3% 2016 4.2%.
At 31 March 2017 the Group had unutilised bank facilities of 158m and 109m of cash.
The bank facilities are primarily available to fund Phase Two of the Groups redevelopment of The Bower London EC1 the construction works at Barts Square London EC1 including the last phase of residential its retirement village development programme and future potential investment purchases.
TOTAL ACCOUNTING RETURN The total accounting return is the growth in the net asset value of the Company plus dividends paid in the year expressed as a percentage of the net asset value at the beginning of the period.
The metric measures the growth in shareholders funds each year and is expressed as an absolute measure.
TOTAL PROPERTY RETURN We calculate our Total Property Return to enable us to assess the aggregate of income and capital profits made each year from our property activities.
Our business is primarily aimed at producing surpluses in the value of our assets through asset management and development with the income side of the business seeking to cover our annual administration and finance costs.

Risk management starts at Board level where the Directors set the overall risk appetite of the Group and the risk management strategies.
Helicals management runs the business within these guidelines and part of its role is to act within these strategies and to report to the Board on how they are being operated.
The Groups risk appetite and risk management strategies are continually assessed by the Board to ensure that they are appropriate and consistent with the Groups overall strategy and with external market conditions.
The effectiveness of the Groups risk management strategy is reviewed regularly by the Audit and Risk Committee and by the full Board.
The Board has ultimate responsibility for risk within the business.
However the small size of the team and our flat management structure allows the Executive Directors to have close contact with all aspects of the business and allows them to ensure that the identification and management of risks and opportunities is part of the mindset of all decision makers at Helical.
PRINCIPAL RISKS
Risk is an integral part of any groups business activities and Helicals ability to identify assess monitor and manage each risk to which it is exposed is fundamental to its financial stability current and future financial performance and reputation.
As well as seeing changes in our internal and external environment as potential risks we also see them as being opportunities which can drive performance.
HELICAL PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 VIABILITY STATEMENT The Directors have assessed the viability of the Group for a period of five years to March 2022 being the period for which the Board regularly reviews forecasts and which encompasses the lifetime of the Groups major development projects.
The Board does consider the future performance of the Group beyond the five years but a longer timeframe involves less certainty over the forecasting assumptions.
The viability of the Group is reviewed throughout the year and through multiple channels detailed below The strategic direction of the Group is established by the Board once a year and is captured in the Business Plan which forms the basis of the detailed budgets and actions for the year The Board reviews the principal risks of the Group twice a year reassessing the severity of each risk and determining the Groups proposed response The five year forecasts for the Group are updated and reviewed by the Board on a quarterly basis and Management reviews the shortterm threefour months cash requirements of the Group on a weekly basis and cash balances and movements are monitored daily.
In making their assessment the Board considers the principal risks and then assesses the potential impacts in severe but plausible downside scenarios together with the likely effectiveness of mitigating actions that the Group would have at its disposal.
The most relevant risks and the potential impact of them on the viability of the Group are considered to be A significant reduction in the fair value of the Groups property portfolio which could result in the Group breaching loan covenants and being required to repay a proportion of borrowings A lack of demand from tenants as the Groups development properties near practical completion which could reduce the Groups levels of rental income and profitability and An inability to maintain sufficient levels of rental income which could present a shortterm liquidity risk for the Group.
The Group subjected the cashflow forecasts to sensitivity analysis in which it assessed the impact of significant reductions to the property portfolio fair value and associated rental income on the Groups loan covenants.
Management also modelled the rental income profile of the Group taking into account expected changes to leases and contracted rents comparing expected income with the loan covenant requirements in order to determine points of potential pressure.
Based on the outcomes of the procedures outlined above and other matters considered by the Board it has a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the five year period of their assessment.
GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION STRATEGIC REPORT HELICAL PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 55 OUR PRINCIPAL RISKS
RISKS
Strategic risks are external risks that could prevent the Group delivering its strategy.
These risks principally impact our decision to purchase or exit from a property asset.
The Groups strategy is inconsistent with the market Risk description Changing market conditions could hinder the Groups ability to buy and sell properties envisioned in its strategy.
The location size and mix of properties in the Helical portfolio determine the impact of the risk.
If the Groups chosen markets underperform the impact on the Groups liquidity investment property revaluations and rental income is greater.
The Group carries out significant development projects over several years and is therefore exposed to fluctuations in the market over time.
Mitigationaction
Management constantly monitors the market and makes changes to the Groups strategy in light of market shifts.
The Groups management is highly experienced and has a strong track record of understanding the property market.
Due to the Groups small management team changes in strategy can be implemented quickly.
Management carefully reviews the risk profile of individual developments and in some cases builds properties in several phases to minimise the exposure to reduced demand for particular asset classes or geographical locations over time.
The Group limits the number of speculative developments it does on its own balance sheet.
Property values declinereduced tenant demand for space Risk description The property portfolio is at risk of revaluation falls through changes in market conditions including underperforming sectors or locations lack of tenant demand or general economic uncertainty.
Mitigationaction
The Groups property portfolio is diverse in asset type location and tenant industries reducing overexposure to one sector.
Management reviews external data seeks the advice of industry experts and monitors the performance of individual assets and sectors in order to dispose of nonperforming assets and rebalance the portfolio for the changing market.
Political risk Risk description There is a risk that regulatory and tax changes could adversely affect the market in which the Group operates and changes in legislation could lead to delays in receiving planning permission.
This risk has increased significantly following the United Kingdoms decision to leave the European Union in June 2016.
Mitigationaction
Management seeks advice from experts to ensure continued monitoring of upcoming regulatory and tax changes and to understand the potential impact on the Group.
It maintains good relationships with planning consultants and local authorities.
FINANCIAL
RISKS
Financial risks are those that could prevent the Group from funding its chosen strategy both in the long and short term.
Availability of bank borrowing and cash resources Risk description The inability to roll over existing facilities or take out new borrowing would impact on the Groups ability to maintain its current portfolio and purchase new properties.
The
Group may forego opportunities if it does not maintain sufficient cash to take advantage of them as they arise.
Mitigationaction
The Group maintains a good relationship with many established lending institutions and borrowings are spread across a number of these.
Funding requirements are reviewed weekly by management who ensure that the maturity dates of borrowings are spread over several years.
Management monitors the cash levels of the Group on a daily basis and maintains sufficient levels of cash resources and undrawn committed bank facilities to fund opportunities as they arise.
Breach of loan and bond covenants Risk description If the Group breaches debt covenants lending institutions may require the early repayment of borrowings.

An endorsement of Helicals commitment to managing environmental and social impacts is its continued listing in the FTSE4Good Index.
The FTSE4Good Index measures the performance of companies that meet globally recognised Corporate Responsibility standards and facilitates investment in those companies.
Maintaining listed status on this Index remains a key priority for Helical and informs the evolving approach to Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability.
The benefits of managing environmental and social impacts include an increased ability to secure planning consent improved marketability of assets to prospective tenants reduced operating costs of assets mitigating the risk of future legislation and regulation and enhanced corporate reputation.
MANAGING CORPORATE
Each year Helical reviews and updates its environmental management system which has been in place since 2003.
The environmental management system is available on the Company website and key elements of the system include Environment and Corporate Responsibility policies which set out the Groups highlevel commitment across a number of impact areas.
These are reviewed annually at Board level and are implemented by the senior management team Annual and ongoing performance targets to enable Helical to focus its efforts throughout the year on measurable and achievable performance goals Key Performance Measures to help Helical monitor progress towards these targets and to ensure they can report in line with investor disclosure requirements notably FTSE4Good Checklists to assist in applying minimum sustainability requirements across its development activities.

PEOPLE
Helical has a small core team working closely with trusted partners in multiple disciplines.
Our success is built on the skills of our staff so finding developing rewarding and retaining our people is a key element of our corporate strategy.
As at 31 March 2017 Helical had 30 permanent and three temporary employees 9.1% of the staff based at the Groups head office in London.
In addition there were two employees in the Polish subsidiary and three employees of the retirement village companies.
The majority of the staff working at the retirement villages were transferred to the external company responsible for the day to day management of the sites during the year.
The information set out below is in respect of the head office only.
Gender diversity of the Board and the Company as at 31 March 2017 is set out in the charts to the left.
Helical continues to enforce its equal opportunities harassment and sexual discrimination policies.
We also continue to monitor compliance with its anti bribery and whistle blowing policies.
There have been no incidents to report against these policies to date.
A high level of staff retention remains a key feature of the business.
Staff turnover is low at 5.7% representing two permanent employees leaving in the year.
Helical has retained a highly skilled and experienced team and the table below shows a breakdown of staff by length of service Total number of staff as at 31 March
Executive Directors 4 19.5 Executives 15 5.7 All employees 30 8.0 THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF SERVICE OF OUR PEOPLE IS 8 YEARS.
Helicals staff retention levels not only reflect competitive remuneration and benefits packages but also its commitment to enhancing the professional and personal skills of its team by supporting employee training and development by means of training courses seminars and mentoring.
As in previous years Helical continues to evaluate training needs in line with business objectives.
Collectively our people spent 1148 hours on training and development during the year an average of 5.3 days per employee.
There are no human rights issues of which the Board is aware that are considered relevant to the Group.
As Helical operates with a small team our ability to establish excellent longterm relationships with our advisers agents and other suppliers is very important.
As part of this fair treatment of suppliers remains a key priority for Helical and the Groups policy is to settle all agreed liabilities within the terms established with them.
COLLECTIVELY OUR PEOPLE SPENT 1148 HOURS ON TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT DURING THE YEAR.
ENVIRONMENT
The Groups corporate commitments to environmental issues are outlined in the Groups Environmental Policy which can be found on the Companys website.
The policy details Helicals commitments across a range of impact areas and its development and property management activities.
The Group sets itself targets to guide its environmental responsibilities including resource use and waste production pollution biodiversity timber sourcing tenant engagement flood risk and sustainable design and construction.
HELICAL PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 60 Full details of the Groups performance against the targets during the year is available in the Corporate Responsibilities section of the Companys website but a selection of highlights are presented below Due to changes in the portfolio over the year it is difficult to provide meaningful overall likeforlike statistics.
However of the properties that can be compared The Shepherds Building London W14 has shown an increase in energy consumption of 6% which can be partially attributed to the ongoing major essential repairs to the lifts.
Water consumption increased by 24% with the addition of new showers in the common parts last year and varying usage based on occupancy levels.
The Hub Glasgow has shown an 8% increase in gas consumption attributable to increased occupancy levels although a decrease of 8% in electricity consumption has also been achieved and a 54% decrease in water consumption which is principally a result of works to faulty toilet cisterns.
Churchgate and Lee House Manchester has shown a small decrease in electricity consumption compared with last year but increases of 11% for gas and 34% for water are principally attributed to increased occupancy.
The Morgan Quarter Cardiff has shown a 15% decrease in electricity consumption through implementing a successful awareness raising programme for staff regarding the role they can play in reducing costs and lessening environmental impact.
The Group continues to offer recycling facilities at the larger of its managed assets.
Where data is available Helical comfortably exceeded its ongoing target of a recycling rate of at least 35% at most properties with over 80% of waste generated being recycled at The Loom London E1 211 Old Street London EC1 The Hub Glasgow and Churchgate and Lee House Manchester.
In line with the mandatory requirement for reporting its greenhouse gas emissions Helical provides a separate disclosure in this report below.
GREENHOUSE GAS GHG EMISSIONS REPORTING For the reporting year to 31 March 2017 the 2014 UK Governments Conversion Factors for Company Reporting has been followed.
Greenhouse gas emissions are reported using the following parameters to determine what is included within the reporting boundaries.
Scope 1  direct emissions includes any gas data for landlord controlled parts and fuel use for Group owned vehicles.
Fugitive emissions from air conditioning are included where it is Helicals responsibility within the managed portfolio when the data is available.
Scope 2  indirect energy emissions includes purchased electricity throughout the Groups operations within landlord controlled parts.
Electricity used in refurbishment projects has been recorded separately where appropriate.
In the majority of cases the electricity consumed is recorded for the individual properties as part of the data collection for the management of common parts and contractors have been required to collect project specific data.
The table below highlights that overall GHG emissions have increased by 27% year on year.
The reason for this is primarily due to an increase in tenant occupation at a number of the larger multilet properties which has also increased the common parts consumption.
Data for last year has been restated due to metering and billing issues at a number of properties in particular Churchgate and Lee House Manchester and Leighton Buzzard.
For Scope 1 this represents an increase of 226 tonnes and for Scope 2 an increase of 469 tonnes.
Due to the changing portfolio the likeforlike GHG emissions are only reported for a small number of properties seven properties for electricity and three properties for gas.
Although consumption overall for the portfolio has increased the likeforlike performance across the assessed properties has reduced by 8%.
This is due in part to improved energy efficiency light fittings and a greater awareness of responsibilities regarding personal impact on consumption.
Only three multilet office buildings and one shopping centre can report on carbon intensity.
At Churchgate and Lee House Manchester The Hub Glasgow and The Shepherds Building London W14 the average carbon intensity equates to 0.11 tCO em whilst The Morgan Quarter Cardiff has a carbon intensity of 0.01 tCO em These levels are consistent with last years performance.
Greenhouse gas emissions tonnes CO are set out below for the year Total portfolio Tonnes CO Likeforlike portfolio Tonnes CO Year ended Year ended Year ended Year ended Scope 1 Direct emissions 796 1009 366 382 Scope 2 Indirect emissions 2877 3628 1288 1144 Total all scopes 3673 4637 1654 1526 The specific target set by Helical is to reduce energy consumption by 2% pa in the principal managed assets.
As discussed earlier in this section of the report year on year performance is variable across the portfolio and complicated by the changing nature of the portfolio through acquisition and divestment increasing occupancy and ongoing refurbishment of the component assets.
Likeforlike has seen an improvement of 8% on the 2016 baseline performance achieving the 2% reduced energy consumption target.

CHARITABLE COMMUNITY AND SOCIAL INITIATIVES Helical takes a strong interest in charitable community and social issues.
As a group we recognise that the buildings that we own and develop have an impact on the local environment and the communities that live and work there and we believe that engagement with those communities is an important part of our activities.
Community engagement is an ongoing concern throughout the development process from planning until development completion and operation.
Over the past year Helical has set up social media accounts on Twitter LinkedIn and Instagram in order to communicate more effectively with our tenants and other stakeholders.
A quarterly online newsletter City Life has also been introduced which circulates articles on the Groups projects occupiers and contributing partners.
These can all be accessed through the Helical website.
As part of our commitment to the regions in which we operate we regularly support community initiatives.
Some examples from the year to 31 March 2017 include The Morgan Quarter Cardiff team worked with Cardiff Pride last summer to provide a hub for the LGBT community for a week in the run up to the Pride Festival.
They have also been shortlisted for a Cardiff Life Award in the Property category A number of charity fundraising events have been held at The Shepherds Building London W14 over the last 12 months many of which tie into high profile national charity campaigns for example the MacMillan baking event Wear It Pink Day and Children in Need HEALTH and SAFETY Helical has a corporate culture that is committed to the prevention of injuries and ill health to its employees or other people that may be affected by its activities.
The Groups Health and Safety policy reflects this commitment.
The
Board of Directors and senior executives are responsible for implementing this policy and they look to ensure that health and safety considerations are always given priority in planning and in daytoday activities.
The Groups Health and Safety Policy was last reviewed and updated in February 2017 to reflect the latest legislative and regulatory developments.
Training of Helical staff in the updated Health and Safety Policy and supporting CDM requirements has been undertaken during the reporting year.
The Groups Health and Safety policy can be found on the Companys website and a summary of performance for the 18 active sites is below.
Helical has delivered over two million hours of construction during the year with no fatalities or major accidents and only seven RIDDOR reportable incidents.
Overall Health and Safety performance using Lost Time Accident Frequency Rate is a 61% improvement over last year.
The majority of Helical projects are managed by principal contractors holding OHSAS 18001 certification and that maintain 100% Construction Skills Certification Scheme CSCS accreditation for all full time and subcontracted staff.

Membership of the Group currently includes landowners commercial occupiers and developers.
TAP works in partnership with its members to develop Aldgate as One Location delivering a range of interventions to support community development and develop a premier business hub with high quality public realm and environment that produces a safe convenient and inspiring destination for all employees residents and visitors During the year Helical staff raised funds for numerous charities most particularly LandAid the property industrys charity.
LandAid works with young disadvantaged people in the UK who are living on the streets or who are at severe risk of homelessness to provide them with accommodation and training as well as working to tackle the root causes of homelessness.
Seven members of Helicals staff participated in the 10k LandAid Run and five employees took part in LandAid Day touring around London raising over 17000 in donations from local businesses.
One Helical staff member participated in the Source to Sea  a nonstop relay race from the source of the River Thames to the sea stretching 237 miles averaging more than 33 miles per runner and raising over 9000 for LandAid Helical has been a sponsor of the Property Race Day every year since it started in 2006 raising funds for a number of national charities Alongside the Groups formal charitable activities Helical employees raise funds for charities on a personal basis and where appropriate the Group will make donations to help the staff reach their fundraising goals and To help encourage young people to enter the property industry for the last ten years Helical has held a work experience event comprising a twoday intensive introductory programme into London Real Estate run by Helicals Chief Executive with support from the senior members of the Property team.
The package is available to 810 students studying either a BA or Masters in Real Estate or equivalent qualification.
WE RECOGNISE THAT THE BUILDINGS WE OWN AND DEVELOP HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT AND THE COMMUNITIES THAT LIVE AND WORK THERE AND WE BELIEVE THAT ENGAGEMENT WITH THOSE COMMUNITIES IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR ACTIVITIES.
FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES Helical recognises that changing social and environmental factors need to be taken into account when considering our broad business strategies as these may give rise to opportunities to be exploited or risks to be mitigated.
Such factors include The uncertainties surrounding future changes to environmental and social legislation and potential changes to labour markets following the UKs decision to leave the European Union The implications for the property sector of global agreements to tackle climate change and more local actions that may be taken to tackle specific environmental issues for example measures to reduce air pollution in city centres and Broader technological and social changes that may impact on our tenants our partners and the wider communities where our properties are sited.
As a group we keep such matters under review and act as necessary to ensure that we meet our obligations.

DEAR SHAREHOLDER I am pleased to be able to address Shareholders for the first time as Chairman of Helical.
After leading the Company as Chief Executive for 32 years I was delighted the Board selected Gerald Kaye to be my successor and am confident he will lead the Company with distinction for many years.
The Company has had a good year despite an uncertain background following the decision to leave the European Union.
The rationalisation of the portfolio leaves the Company with a focused portfolio balanced between a London investment and development programme providing both capital and rental growth opportunities and a high yielding regional investment portfolio.
COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD The composition of the Board is discussed in greater detail in the Nominations Committee Report on pages 76 to 77.
Following the changes implemented at the 2016 AGM the Board consists of a NonExecutive Chairman four Executive Directors and five independent Non Executive Directors a balance which satisfies governance requirements for a FTSE 350 Company notwithstanding that we are currently outside of that index.
There are no changes proposed at the AGM on the 13 July 2017 and none are anticipated before 2019.
Good governance is reflected in the contribution that a diverse Board offers and the Company will seek to make further progress in this area in future years.
BOARD DECISIONS Much of the year was taken up in discussion of the changing economic and political environment and outlook for our markets against a background of the decision to leave the European Union and other geopolitical factors.
In addition the Board meeting agendas during the year contained many issues including A review of the Groups corporate property and financial strategy A complete review of the Companys compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 2014 and the introduction of new policies on diversity and slavery Consideration and approval of significant property transactions and Completion of the changes to the composition of the Board as outlined on page 76.

We have also sought to strengthen our compliance with Corporate Governance requirements.

We have also sought to reflect the recommendations of the Financial Reporting Council in their note on Developments in Corporate Governance and Stewardship 2016 issued in January 2017.
COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD AND ALIGNMENT TO CORPORATE STRATEGY The Code requires a Board and its committees to have an appropriate balance of skills experience independence and knowledge of the Company to enable them to discharge their duties and responsibilities effectively and in line with its corporate strategy.
Helical operates with a strong management team of senior decision makers backed up by a finance team and other support staff.
The Group is keen to promote exceptional talent to Board level at the earliest opportunity to expose such individuals to the broader issues facing the business encourage their longterm commitment to the Group and provide for future succession.
Provision B.1.2 of the Code notes that companies such as Helical which are below the FTSE350 are required to have at least two independent NonExecutive Directors.
Following the changes to the Board at the 2016 AGM the Board comprises the Chairman four Executive Directors and five independent NonExecutive Directors a balance in line with the Codes requirement for FTSE 350 companies.
The Chairman is Michael Slade former Chief Executive of Helical who was reelected as a Director and assumed his new role as Chairman at the 2016 AGM with 85% of votes cast by Shareholders in favour of his reelection.
In advance of these changes the Company consulted with Shareholders and proceeded with the indicated approval of a significant majority.
However as noted in last years Annual Report Michael Slade is not considered to have been independent on his appointment as required by the Governance Code.
As a consequence the Board has ensured that there are safeguards in place to counter any concerns regarding his independence status.
In particular he does not chair the Nominations Committee although he is a member of that Committee and is not a member of the Audit and Risk or Remuneration Committees.
Furthermore the Board Evaluation process is run by Richard Gillingwater the Companys Senior Independent
Notwithstanding this the Board considers Michael Slade to be of independent character and judgement.
In assessing his contribution to the business the other members of the Board consider Michael Slade to be a valuable asset to the Company providing almost 50 years of experience in the real estate sector.
The independent NonExecutive Directors are Richard Gillingwater Senior Independent Director Susan Clayton Richard Cotton Richard Grant and Michael ODonnell.
Between them the NonExecutive team provide a current FTSE 100 Chairman an Executive Director of CBRE the leading advisor on commercial property and real estate matters a former head of UK Real Estate at J P Morgan Cazenove the current Finance Director at Cadogan Estates a real estate family owned trust owning a substantial part of West London and a private equity corporate advisor with residential and retirement living experience.
In the Boards view the Board and its Committees have the appropriate balance of skills experience independence and knowledge of the real estate sector the listed environment financial accounting and the Company to discharge their respective duties effectively as required by the Code.
CULTURE OF THE COMPANY In July 2016 the Financial Reporting Council FRC issued a report entitled Corporate Culture and the Role of
During the year under review the Company has started to reflect the recommendations of the report in its governance structures and culture with greater engagement and involvement of Board members and employees in identifying documenting and targeting its strategic aims and objectives.
In particular senior property professionals below Board level regularly make presentations to the Board on assets they are responsible for.
In addition in considering the Companys Annual Strategy Review the Executive Directors met with and discussed the views of the senior management of Helical and incorporated their views in the final Strategy Report.
In taking this action the Company is seeking to reflect the main aims of the FRC report which are to Connect purpose and strategy to culture Align values and incentives and Assess measure and report on the Companys culture.
The Company will consider how it can adopt the recommendations of the report during the year to 31 March 2018 and will report back to Shareholders on its impact in the Annual Report 2018.
THE UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE 2014 THE CODE The Board is accountable to the Groups Shareholders for good corporate governance and we believe in applying the highest principles of corporate governance.
We have complied throughout the year with the principles as set out in the section of the Code headed The Main Principles of the Code and except where stated above in relation to Michael Slade and in respect of sending out the Notice of the AGM and related papers to shareholders at least 20 working days before the meeting where they were sent out 18 days before the 2016 AGM have complied with the provisions of the Code throughout the year under review.
At Helical we believe that robust corporate governance is of fundamental importance in delivering for shareholders the longterm success of the Company through the effective entrepreneurial and prudent management of the Company.
HELICAL PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 72 GOVERNANCE REVIEW ANNUAL EVALUATION OF THE BOARD Since the Company is not in the FTSE 350 the Code does not require our annual Board evaluation to be externally facilitated every three years.
However following the changes to the Board in 2016 it was proposed that the 2017 Board evaluation would be carried out externally to ensure that the Groups Board and governance process is highly effective in carrying out its responsibilities.
In
January 2017 we retained SA Associates an executive search and board evaluation services firm to undertake a full external evaluation which involved An initial briefing on the future strategy of the Company from the Chairman Senior Independent Director and the Chief Executive The observation of Board meetings and Committee meetings Distribution of a short focussed questionnaire to each Board member Conducting onetoone interviews and Reviewing governance documents and Board meeting agendas and minutes.
The key areas for consideration were Board composition roles and responsibilities Board culture dynamics teamwork and leadership Board processes reporting and agendas overall Board effectiveness strategy input and relationship between Board and management.
The evaluation report by SA Associates was presented for discussion at the March Board meeting.
The overall findings noted that Helical has an effective Board with a positive dynamic and a good platform to challenge and support.
The following key strengths and development opportunities were identified Key Strengths The new Chairman and Chief Executive have settled well into their respective roles The relationships between Executive and NonExecutive Directors is strong The Board applies good governance practices across the business Discussion of strategic issues including consideration of the annual Strategy Review receive suitable discussion time and Health and safety issues receive appropriate focus.
Development Opportunities Time allocated to discussion of a broader Corporate Strategy could be increased Elevating the importance of discussion of risks facing the business and Talent development and succession throughout the Company could receive more focus.
Actions for 201718 At the March 2017 Board meeting the Board discussed and agreed the following actions The introduction of a Strategy Day for the whole Board incorporating external speakers The reallocation of the primary responsibility for risk from the Executive Committee to a renamed Audit and Risk Committee and Greater exposure for those below Board level to the full Board.

The report of the Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee describing the issues considered by the Committee in the year under review is on pages 78 and 79.
Risk Management and Internal Controls The Board is responsible for maintaining a sound system of internal control to safeguard shareholders investment and the Groups assets.
Such a system is designed to manage but cannot eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives.
There are inherent limitations in any control system and accordingly even the most effective system can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The key features of the Groups system of internal control are as follows Clearly defined organisational responsibilities and limits of authority.
The daytoday involvement of the Executive Directors in the running of the business ensures that these responsibilities and limits are adhered to Financial controls and review procedures Financial information systems including cash flow profit and capital expenditure forecasts.
The Board receives regular and comprehensive reports on the daytoday running of the business An Audit and Risk Committee which meets with the Auditors and deals with any significant internal control matters.
In the year under review the Audit and Risk Committee met with the Auditors on two occasions and The Board is responsible for the management of the Groups risk profile which is reviewed by the Audit and Risk Committee during the year.
An analysis of the Groups principal risks can be found on pages 54 to 57.
GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION STRATEGIC REPORT HELICAL PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 73 VIABILITY AND GOING CONCERN The Companys Viability Statement is included on page 55 within the Principal Risks Review of the Strategic Report.
The Directors have reviewed the current and projected financial position of the Group making reasonable assumptions about future trading performance.
The key areas of sensitivity are Timing and value of property sales Availability of loan finance and related cash flows Future property valuations and their impact on covenants and potential loan repayments Committed future expenditure Future rental income and Receipt amount and timing of development profits.
The forecast cash flows have been sensitised to reflect those cash inflows which are less certain and to take account of a potential deterioration of property valuations.
In addition the forecasts have been subject to sensitivity analysis in which the impact of significant reductions to the fair value of the property portfolio and associated rental income on the Groups loan covenants was assessed.
From their review the Directors believe that the Group has adequate resources to continue to be operational as a going concern for the foreseeable future.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETINGS At the 2016 Annual General Meeting held on the 25 July 2016 all the Directors with the exception of Michael Slade discussed below were reelected with over 98% of the votes cast in favour of their reelection.
The two resolutions relating to the reappointment and remuneration of the Auditors also received over 98% of the votes cast in favour.
The resolution to renew the Companys Remuneration Policy received a vote in favour of over 97% whilst the resolution to approve amendments to the rules of the Companys Annual Bonus Scheme were approved by over 98%.
The nonbinding vote in respect of the approval of the Companys Directors Remuneration Report received a vote in favour of over 84% see below.
All the remaining resolutions were approved with votes cast in favour by between 94% and 100%.
The reelection of Michael Slade received a vote in favour of 84.5% with 15.5% against.
In addition shares representing 2.1% of the Companys shareholders withheld their vote on this resolution.
We believe that these votes provide strong support for Michael Slades Chairmanship of the Company whilst recognising some Shareholder concern regarding his lack of independence on appointment.
The resolution to approve the Companys

At the 2017 Annual General Meeting to be held on the 13 July 2017 the Company will be seeking reelection of all the current Board members consideration of the Annual Report to 31 March 2017 and approval of the final dividend to be paid on 21 July 2017 the reappointment of and authorisation to set the remuneration of the Companys auditors the approval of the Directors Remuneration Report and a number of regular technical resolutions.

A record of attendance at all Board and Committee meetings is shown on page 74.
The Committee reviewed the following matters during the year Recommendations arising from the Board evaluation Composition of the Board and Membership of the Board Committees and Succession planning.
BOARD APPOINTMENTS AND DIVERSITY Appointments to the Board and its Committees are made against objective criteria.
The Committee controls the process for Board appointments and makes recommendations to the Board.
The Board is mindful of the Groups diversity policy and the Committee gives full consideration to diversity including gender diversity when recommending to the Board any future Board appointments.
All Board appointments are based on experience and will be made on merit.
COMMITTEE MEMBERS
Richard Gillingwater Susan Clayton Richard Cotton Richard Grant Michael ODonnell Michael Slade With the exception of Michael Slade all of the Committee are independent NonExecutive Directors and all served throughout the year.
Michael Slade became a member of the Committee on his appointment as Chairman of the Company on 25 July 2016.
The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee.
ROLE OF THE COMMITTEE Leads the process for Board appointments Board evaluation succession planning and makes recommendations to the Board.
TERMS OF REFERENCE The terms of reference of the Committee are available on request and are included on the Groups website at site DEAR SHAREHOLDER In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code the role of the Nominations Committee and my primary responsibility as its Chairman is to ensure that the Company is headed by an effective Board which is collectively responsible for the longterm success of the Company.
RICHARD GILLINGWATER CBE SENIOR INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR Care is taken to ensure that appointees have enough time available to devote to the job on appointment.
To enable the Board to identify any potential conflicts of interest and ensure that Directors will continue to have sufficient time available to devote to the Company Directors are required to inform the Board of any changes to their other significant commitments.
In February 2017 Susan Clayton informed the Board that she had been appointed Chairman of Barwood Property Fund which is to launch this year.
In April 2017 Mike Slade informed the Board that he had been appointed Chairman of The Royal Marsden Cancer Charitys Clinical Care and Research Centre Appeal.
The Board is satisfied that both Directors will continue to have sufficient time to devote to their roles.
COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD Several Board changes together with details of the recruitment process for the new appointments were set out in last years report and I am pleased that Shareholders voted in support of the Committees recommendations to approve those changes at the 2016
The refreshed Board consists of a NonExecutive Chairman four Executive Directors and five independent NonExecutive Directors.
This provides a strong balance of entrepreneurial leadership and a talented executive team supported by committees with an appropriate balance of skills experience independence and knowledge of the Company to be able to constructively challenge and assist the executive team in achieving its objectives.
No further changes have been made to the composition of the Board during the year.
HELICAL PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 76 NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE REPORT SUCCESSION PLANNING By strengthening our Board evaluation process in employing an external assessor the Company has sought to improve its processes with regard to succession at all levels.
The issue of who should succeed the previous Chief Executive and the balance of the Board with regard to the number of independent NonExecutive Directors compared to Executive Directors has been settled for the foreseeable future.
The focus of the Committee and future Board evaluation processes will now be on ensuring there is a pipeline of potential future senior executives both for below and at Board level.
In considering these matters the Board will seek to reflect a greater diversity at Board and senior management level whilst ensuring that the Company has the requisite balance of skills to ensure its longterm success.
BOARD EVALUATION As detailed in the Governance Review on pages 72 to 75 the Board retained an external assessor SA Associates to undertake a full evaluation of the Board and governance process in January 2017.
At the March 2017 meeting the Committee and Executive Directors discussed the recommendations made in the evaluation report in detail.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING The Board believes that the requirements of Code Provision B.7.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code should be fulfilled.
This provision requires all directors of FTSE350 companies to be subject to annual reelection by shareholders.
Whilst the Company is not in the FTSE350 the Board has chosen to comply with this provision as it accepts that shareholders should annually have the right to vote on each Directors election or reelection to the Board.
At the Annual General Meeting to be held on 13 July 2017 the following resolutions relating to the appointment of Directors are being proposed The reelection of Mike Slade as NonExecutive Chairman The reelection as Executive Directors of Gerald Kaye Tim Murphy Matthew BonningSnook and Duncan Walker and The reelection as NonExecutive Directors of Susan Clayton Richard Cotton Richard Gillingwater Richard Grant and Michael ODonnell.
The Nominations Committee confirms to Shareholders that following the annual formal performance evaluation and taking into account their qualifications and experience these Directors continue to be effective and demonstrate commitment to their roles.
Biographical details of the Directors are given on pages 70 and 71.
I trust that Shareholders will support the Committee and vote in favour of these resolutions.
RICHARD GILLINGWATER CBE Chairman of the Nominations Committee 25 May 2017 BOARD OF DIRECTORS GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION STRATEGIC REPORT HELICAL PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 77 The Committee endorses the principles set out in the FRC Guidance on Audit and Risk Committees.
The Board has formal and transparent arrangements for considering how it applies the Groups financial reporting and internal control principles and for maintaining an appropriate relationship with its auditors.
Whilst all Directors have a duty to act in the interests of the Group this Committee has a particular role acting independently from the Executive Directors to ensure that the interests of Shareholders are properly protected in relation to financial reporting and internal control.
Appointments to the Committee are made by the Board on the recommendation of the Nominations Committee in consultation with the Audit and Risk Committee members.
THE WORK OF THE AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE IN THE YEAR The Committee met five times during the year and a record of attendance at these meetings is shown on page 74.
It is common practice at Helical for Audit and Risk Committee meetings to be attended by all Board members whether or not they are members of the Committee so that their contribution to the matters discussed may be obtained.
In conjunction with the Board the Audit and Risk Committee reviewed the following matters during the year Risk and internal controls The financial statements of the Group and the announcement of the annual results to 31 March 2016 and the interim statement on the half year results to 30 September 2016 The Annual Report for the year to 31 March 2016 to ensure it is fair balanced and understandable The performance of the external auditors and their programme of work The reappointment of the Groups external auditor The external auditors independence and the provision of nonaudit services by the external auditor and The consideration of the requirement for an internal audit function.
The Audit and Risk Committee met the external auditor on two occasions to discuss matters arising from the annual and interim audits.
Other matters formally reviewed and discussed by the Committee during the year included Review of company policies including those relating to antibribery and the Modern Slavery Act The Companys whistleblowing procedures to ensure that they remain effective.
Under the Companys Whistleblowing Policy employees and workers within the Group may raise concerns about malpractice or misconduct in confidence either internally or outside of the Company to the independent audit partner and Review of IT risk and business continuity planning.
In discharging its responsibilities in connection with the preparation of the financial statements for the year to 31 March 2017 the Committee is responsible for reviewing the appropriateness of the Groups accounting policies assumptions judgements and estimates as applied by the executive management to the financial statements.
During this review the following significant issues were considered Internal Controls The Committee annually reviews the need for an internal audit function and recently reaffirmed its stance that in view of the small scale and simplicity of the business it does not consider that an internal audit function would be effective.
However periodically the Committee asks the Groups auditors to review its internal controls and their most recent report was presented to the Committee in April 2015.
Grant Thorntons Report on the Design and Operating Effectiveness of Internal Controls of Helical plc provided a review of the Groups control environment and internal controls.
Neither this report nor the Audit and Risk Committees review highlighted any material weaknesses in the design and effectiveness of the Groups systems and controls.
DEAR SHAREHOLDER During the year the responsibilities of the Audit Committee were broadened to include
This formalised the Committees mandate to oversee the Groups identification monitoring and mitigation of risk.
COMMITTEE MEMBERS
Richard Grant Susan Clayton Richard Cotton Richard Gillingwater Michael ODonnell All of whom are independent NonExecutive Directors and all served throughout the year.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee.
ROLE OF THE COMMITTEE Assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities by reviewing and monitoring The integrity of the financial information provided to shareholders The Companys system of internal controls and risk management The external audit process and auditors and The processes for compliance with laws regulations and ethical codes of practice.
TERMS OF REFERENCE The terms of reference of the Committee are available on request and are included on the Groups website at site RICHARD GRANT CHAIRMAN OF THE AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE HELICAL PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 78 AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT  Property Valuation The valuation of the Groups investment and trading and development portfolio is a key area of judgement in preparing the annual and half yearly financial statements and reports.
For this reason the fair value of the Groups investment portfolio is determined by independent third party experts who are familiar with the markets in which the Group operates and have suitable professional qualifications.
The Groups trading and development stock is accounted for in the financial statements at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Accordingly the Committee reviews the assumptions made in considering whether an asset should be written down to its net realisable value if lower than cost.
In addition the Committee reviews those instances where stock is considered to have a fair value above its current book value.
The surplus of fair value above book value is not included in the Groups Balance Sheet nor is any movement reflected in the Income Statement.
However in accordance with the best practice recommendations of the European Public Real Estate Association the surplus is included in the calculation of the EPRA Net Asset Value per share at each reporting date.
The fair value calculation of the trading and development stock is reviewed by a suitably qualified independent third party valuer.
In order to assist the Audit and Risk Committee in considering the valuations the fair values of the investment trading and development property portfolios are reviewed and approved by the Property Valuations Committee which is chaired by Susan Clayton FRICS an independent NonExecutive Director.
Revenue Recognition Revenue recognition is a presumed significant risk under International Standards on Auditing UK and Ireland and where the Group enters into complex transactions judgment must be applied in determining when and to what extent revenue should be recognised.
For material transactions technical papers are presented to the Committee by Management and the Committee also requests that the Groups external auditors review and report on these judgments.
The Committee assesses the appropriateness of the proposed revenue recognition for each transaction and these are discussed between the external auditor and myself.
In addition to the significant issues discussed above the Committee also considered and concluded upon the Groups ability to continue as a going concern and the estimates and judgements discussed in note 37 to these accounts.
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EXTERNAL AUDITOR During the year the Audit and Risk Committee reviewed Grant Thornton UK LLPs fees effectiveness and whether the agreed audit plan had been fulfilled and the reasons for any variation from the plan.
The Audit and Risk Committee also considered their robustness and the degree to which they were able to assess key accounting and audit judgements and the content of their reports.
This was performed through reviewing their reports and meeting with them to discuss their audit approach and findings.
In addition the Committee was notified by the Financial Reporting Council FRC that they had carried out a review of Grant Thornton UK LLP and the work they performed in conducting the audit of Helicals 31 March 2016 results.
The FRC assessed that Grant Thorntons audit procedures in respect of investment property valuations could be significantly improved.
Grant Thornton subsequently agreed the changes it would make in its approach with the FRC to address the shortcomings in their audit work identified in the FRC report.
The Committee took the results of this review seriously and met with Grant Thornton and management in advance of the 2017 audit to discuss their revised approach and then at the conclusion of the audit process to satisfy itself that these changes had been appropriately implemented.
As a result of their review the Committee concluded that the audit process was effective.
AUDIT INDEPENDENCE The Audit and Risk Committee considers the external auditor to be independent.
The Committees policy is not to award nonaudit services where the outcome of the work is relevant to a future audit judgement or that could impact the independence or objectivity of the audit firm.
This policy is designed to ensure that the Group receives the most appropriate advice without compromising the independence of the Auditor.
As part of this policy prior approval of nonaudit services that exceed 20000 is required.
During the year the following nonaudit fees were paid to Grant Thornton UK LLP 45750 for the review of the Half Year Results 6000 for the review of the Performance Share Plan and Directors Bonus Scheme 4311 for advisory services in relation to the Groups Polish operations carried out by a separate team to the audit and the work was not relied upon by the audit team in reaching their opinion and 13440 for local taxation compliance work in the Netherlands.
The Committee considered all the services to be appropriate and that they did not impact the audit independence.
AUDITOR ROTATION The Audit and Risk Committee has reviewed the EU guidance for mandatory auditor rotation which has now been adopted into UK law.
Under this legislation Grant Thornton are required to rotate from the audit after the 31 March 2020 year end.
After considering this legislation best practice guidance and the Groups strategic position the Committee has determined to carry out a tender process in 2018 with the aim of having a new firm in place to report on the 31 March 2019 year end.
Given their period of tenure as the incumbent auditor Grant Thornton will not be included in this process.
The proposed timeline for the tender process is set out below

In the year to 31 March 2017 the Committee completed its review of its remuneration policy in the light of the 2016 reshaping of the Board the Executive Bonus Plan 2011 reaching the end of its shareholder approved life at the end of the previous financial period and a desire to acknowledge sensitivities surrounding executive pay.
At the 2016 AGM shareholders approved an amended Helical Annual Bonus Scheme 2016 which removed potential additional bonus awards of 300% of salary in 2017 and 2022 which would have been available under the previous scheme and introduced additional shareholder protections and an updated Remuneration
In addition the Committee considered a number of other matters during the financial year as follows New service contracts were introduced for all Executive Directors which included a reduction in notice periods from 12 to six months.
These contracts came into effect on 25 July 2016 The bonuses payable under the terms of the Annual Bonus Scheme 2012 for the year to 31 March 2016 were finalised.
Two thirds of these bonuses were paid in cash in June 2016 and one third in deferred shares to be held for a minimum of three years The final bonuses payable in accordance with the terms of the Executive Bonus Plan 2011 were paid in June 2016 for the year to 31 March 2016 The three year performance conditions in respect of the share awards granted in 2013 under the Performance Share Plan 2004 were considered.
The performance conditions were fully satisfied and therefore 100% of shares vested The terms of unvested PSP awards held by Michael Slade were amended to reduce the awards to reflect the proportion of the vesting period served as an Executive Director The Committee resolved in June 2016 to make an award of shares under the terms of the 2014 Performance Share Plan which is expected to vest in June 2019 subject to performance conditions Changes to the basic salaries of the Executive Directors as noted below were approved and The fees paid to the Chairman were reviewed in March 2017 and no increase was awarded.
For completeness ANNUAL STATEMENT MICHAEL ODONNELL CHAIRMAN OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE The Company has once again produced a good set of results with an increase in EPRA NAV per share of 3.7% 3 year CAGR of 14.8% and with Shareholders Funds more than doubled since 2013.

REWARD
Basic Salaries In the 2016 Directors Remuneration Report I reported on changes to the Companys Remuneration Policy which were approved by shareholders at the 2016 AGM.
Included
Gerald Kayes salary would be increased to 515000 a level 20800 below that of his predecessor.
In addition Duncan Walkers salary would be increased to that of Matthew BonningSnook.
It was noted that both increases would be implemented over a two year period with the final increase effective from 1 April 2017 and would be subject to the satisfactory performance of the two Directors in that period.
In
March 2017 the Remuneration Committee reviewed the performance of both Gerald Kaye and Duncan Walker and was satisfied that the final increases to the targeted salary levels should be implemented with effect from 1 April 2017.
It is expected that future increases will be linked to RPI.
The salaries of Matthew BonningSnook and Tim Murphy were increased by 3.1% reflecting RPI to 31 March 2017.
The salaries of all other staff were also reviewed and increased by an average of 6.7%.
All increases were effective from 1 April 2017.
Annual Bonus Scheme 2016 Subsequent to the year end and in accordance with the rules of the Helical Annual Bonus Scheme 2016 cash and deferred shares have been approved for inclusion in the financial statements for the year to 31 March 2017.
For the relevant participants these are 50% of what would have been payable under the Annual Bonus Scheme 2012 should its final year have been implemented.
Details of these annual bonus awards are disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Performance Share Plan 2014 Share awards made in 2014 under the terms of the 2014 Performance Share Plan PSP were subject to three performance conditions over the three years to 31 March 2017.
One third of the awards were based on absolute net asset value performance the second third of the awards were based on a comparison of the Groups portfolio return to the IPD Total Return index and the final third of the awards were based on a comparison of the Groups Total Shareholder Return to a basket of companies in the Real Estate Super Sector.
The performance criteria were measured at the end of the three year period and both of the net asset value and IPD conditions were met in full.
The TSR conditions were not met and consequently 66.7% of the awards are expected to vest in July 2017.
Remuneration Policy for the Year to 31 March 2018 The Committee is committed to ensuring that its remuneration policy remains aligned to the longterm interests of shareholders  incentivising management to increase total returns and growing net asset value per share  whilst ensuring that an appropriate balance is maintained between the targets set for management and the risk profile of the Group.
The
Committee believes it has struck the right balance between fixed annual remuneration and an incentive structure with challenging targets which seek to reward outperformance with a mixture of cashbased bonus payments and longer term share awards.
Further details of the proposed implementation of the remuneration policy for the year to 31 March 2018 can be found on pages 92 to 94.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING The Companys Remuneration Policy was approved at the 2016 AGM with over 97% of shareholders voting in favour of the new arrangements.
We are not proposing any changes this year but for reference purposes only include the full policy for shareholders on pages 82 to 86.
At the 2017 AGM to be held on 13 July 2017 a resolution in respect of the Annual Statement and Annual Report on Remuneration for the year to 31 March 2017 is being proposed.
I trust that shareholders will support the Committee and vote in favour of this resolution.
MICHAEL ODONNELL Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 25 May 2017 although not a Committee responsibility the Board excluding NonExecutive Directors reviewed NonExecutive Director fees and no increases were awarded.

REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT
This section of the Remuneration Report sets out the remuneration policy of the Group.
The Committee believes that the policy continues to support the Groups strategy and is aligned with Shareholders interests.
REMUNERATION POLICY Helicals approach to the remuneration of its Executive Directors is to provide a basic remuneration package below the median level of its peers within the listed real estate sector the FTSE 350 Super Sector Real Estate Index excluding storage companies agencies and companies run by external investment managers combined with an incentive based bonus and share scheme structure aligned with the interests of its shareholders.
The majority of performance based awards are judged on the absolute performance of the Group through its profitability and growth in net asset value per share.
The remaining awards are judged on the relative performance of the Groups real estate portfolio and its total shareholder return against appropriate industry benchmarks.
Remuneration within the real estate sector is monitored and reviewed regularly to ensure that the Groups positioning of its remuneration remains in line with these objectives.
In addition to this external view the Committee also monitors the remuneration levels of senior management below Board level and the remuneration of other employees to ensure that these are taken into account in determining the remuneration of Executive Directors.
It also considers environmental social governance and risk issues.
In determining such policy the Committee takes into account all factors which it deems necessary.
The objective of the remuneration policy is to ensure that Executive Directors and senior management are provided with appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced performance and are in a fair and responsible manner rewarded for their individual contributions to the success of the Group.
Within the terms of the agreed policy the Committee shall determine for the Executive Directors The total individual remuneration packages of each Executive Director including where appropriate basic salaries bonuses share awards and other benefits Targets and hurdles for any performance related remuneration schemes and Service agreements incorporating termination payments and compensation commitments.

In addition to the above Executive Directors may also participate in any allemployee share arrangement operated by the Company up to prevailing HMRC limits.
However employees including Directors who participate in the Groups longterm incentive awards are excluded from the Helical Bar 2010 Approved Share Option Scheme.
GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION STRATEGIC REPORT HELICAL PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 83 HOW EMPLOYEE PAY IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AND COMPARED TO THE REMUNERATION POLICY OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS All permanent employees of the Group including Executive Directors receive a basic remuneration package including basic salary private medical cover permanent health insurance life assurance and membership of the Share Incentive Plan.
In addition Directors and senior management are entitled to the use of company cars or the payment of a car allowance and a car fuel allowance.
There is no Group pension scheme for Directors and no contributions are payable into Directors own pension schemes.
For all permanent employees below Board level the Company pays pension contributions of either 7.5% or 10.0% into either a Group Pension Scheme or individual employees own pension scheme.
Whilst employees below Board level are not entitled to participate in the Annual Bonus Scheme discretionary bonuses are paid to employees on an individual basis depending on their performance and contribution.
The Performance Share Plan is available to all employees but is primarily utilised to incentivise Executive Directors and senior management.
An HMRC approved Share Option Scheme is available for the Committee to grant options to those who do not receive awards under the Performance Share Plan.
Consequently Directors are not granted awards under this scheme.
In determining executive remuneration the Committee considers the overall remuneration of all the Groups employees and other than in exceptional circumstances seeks to award increases in salaries at levels below those made to other staff and within its own guidelines.
The remaining remuneration is weighted towards performance related awards.
The Committee does not consult with its employees when drawing up the Groups remuneration policy.
PERFORMANCE METRICS The performance metrics used in the Annual Bonus Scheme and the Long Term Incentives Plan are aligned with the Groups Key Performance Indicators discussed on pages 20 to 21.
The Annual Bonus Scheme 2016 is a profit sharing model which takes the results of the Company including valuation movements on its property portfolio and after charging all finance costs nonperformance related administration costs and a charge for the use of the Groups equity initially set at 7% but subject to regular review allocates the net results into a profit pool for payment to participants with maximum limits deferral clawback and other shareholder protections.
The scheme is open to all Executive Directors.
Longterm incentives awarded in accordance with the rules of the 2014 PSP are subject to an absolute net asset value growth test a relative performance metric based on the performance of the Groups property portfolio compared to an IPD index and a relative performance metric based on Total Shareholder Return.
RECRUITMENT POLICY In considering the structure of the Board the balance between Executive Directors and independent NonExecutive Directors and the skills knowledge and experience required to ensure the Board functions in accordance with the Groups objectives the Committee will seek to apply the following principles in relation to the remuneration of new directors whether by internal promotion or external appointment Element Policy Salary The salary of newly appointed Executive Directors would reflect the individuals experience and skills and be targeted below the median of appropriate sector comparables taking into account internal comparisons.
On initial appointment salaries would generally be set at a level lower than benchmarked for that role to allow for pay increases to market levels subject to satisfactory progress and contribution.
Benefits Benefits would be as are currently provided and periodically reviewed being car or car allowance car fuel allowance private medical cover permanent health insurance and life assurance.
Pension There is no Group pension scheme for Directors and no contributions are payable to Directors own pension schemes.
Annual bonus Annual bonus arrangements under the terms of the 2016 Annual Bonus Scheme will be made in accordance with the terms of that scheme with the Committee retaining the right to prorata any bonus payable in respect of the year of appointment.
Longterm incentives Annual awards under the terms of the 2014 PSP will be made in accordance with the terms of that Plan.
Share Incentive Plan In line with that of existing Executive Directors.
Buyout awards Should it be deemed necessary to compensate a new director for loss of bonus or incentives from a previous employer the Committee may structure the remuneration of such director to buyout any such bonus or incentives on a likeforlike basis in respect of currency ie cash versus shares timing and performance targets.
Where possible such buyout will be structured within the Companys existing incentive arrangements but the Committee has the discretion to implement the exemption under rule 9.4.2 of the Listing Rules.
NonExecutive Directors Newly appointed NonExecutive Directors will be paid fees at a level consistent with existing NonExecutive
Fees would be paid prorata in the year of appointment.
HELICAL PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 84
DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT
CONTINUED LEAVER POLICY On termination of employment each Director may be entitled to a payment in lieu of notice of basic salary and other contractual entitlements ie provision of a car health and life insurance etc.
The Group may make payments in lieu of notice as one lump sum or in instalments at its own discretion.
If the Group chooses to pay in instalments the Director is obliged to seek alternative income over the relevant period and to disclose the amount to the Group.
Instalment payments will be reduced by any alternative income.

For good leavers individuals would cease to accrue future amounts into the Bonus Award Pool although would continue to receive deferred share awards and any remaining amounts held in the Bonus Award Pool for a period of two years after cessation.
Any sharebased entitlements granted to an Executive Director under the Groups share plans will be determined based on the relevant plan rules.
For awards granted under the 2014 PSP awards held by good leavers will vest on the normal vesting date subject to performance conditions and time prorating unless the Committee determines that awards should vest at cessation andor time prorating should not apply.
NONEXECUTIVE DIRECTORS NonExecutive Directors are appointed by a Letter of Appointment and their remuneration is determined by the
Current Letters of Appointment setting out the terms of appointment operate from 1 April 2015 or if later the date of appointment.
The appointment of NonExecutive Directors is terminable on three months notice.

Basic salary and benets Bonus PSP SHARE OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES Directors will not normally be permitted to sell shares received through the 2014 PSP other than to meet taxation and national insurance contributions liabilities for at least two years and until they own shares to the value of 300% increased from 200% of basic salary for Executive Directors and 100% of salary for other Senior Management.
ALIGNMENT WITH SHAREHOLDER INTERESTS The Remuneration Committee has analysed the potential gains that may be made by Executives Directors and those below Board level through the 2014 PSP and other incentive arrangements currently in place.
It has concluded that the share of the increase in the value of the Group measured as the increase in the net asset value before incentives plus cash returned as dividends to shareholders that could accrue to all Executives through the Groups long and shortterm incentive and bonus plans at the point at which the maximum awards vest over the term of the plans might be of the order of 20%.
At this point in absolute terms the Group will have increased its triple net asset value by at least 15% pa with the Groups relative performance placing it in the top quartile of IPD and Total Shareholder Return over each three year period.
REWARD SCENARIOS The charts below show how the composition of the Executive Directors remuneration packages varies at three performance levels namely at minimum ie fixed pay target assumed to be 50% of the maximum incentive levels and maximum levels under the policy set out in the table overleaf.
The chart is based on Salary levels effective 1 April 2017 An approximated annual value of benefits no pension is provided A 300% of salary maximum annual bonus for the CEO and other directors and 200% for the Finance Director with target assumed to be 50% of the maximum A 300% of salary award under the 2014 PSP in line with the normal maximum award with target assumed to be 50% of the maximum and No share price appreciation in respect of deferred bonus and PSP awards has been assumed.

As such Duncan Walkers basic salary was increased from 357000 to 400600 on 1 April 2017 the same level as Matthew BonningSnook.
Following completion of these planned changes subsequent increases for all Executive Directors are expected to be limited to inflationary increases each year.

Helicals share price at that date was 287.50 per share a small premium to the EPRA net asset value per share of 286.00p per share.
The Companys share price at that stage had not fallen as much as the average of the FTSE 350 SuperSector Real Estate Index and remained at a premium until 2012.

By Order of the Board JAMES MOSS FCA Company Secretary 25 May 2017 GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION STRATEGIC REPORT HELICAL PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 99 The Directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report Governance and the Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year.
Under that law the Directors have to prepare the financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs and profit or loss of the Company and Group for that period.
In preparing these financial statements the Directors are required to select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent state whether applicable IFRSs have been followed subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements and prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Companys transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors confirm that so far as each Director is aware there is no relevant audit information of which the Companys auditor is unaware and the Directors have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as directors in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Auditors are aware of that information.
The Directors consider the Annual Report and the financial statements taken as a whole provides the information necessary to assess the Companys performance business model and strategy and is fair balanced and understandable.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Groups website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
We confirm to the best of our knowledge the Group financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union give a true and fair view of the assets liabilities financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole and the Annual Report including the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Independent Auditors Report to the Members of Helical plc Consolidated Income Statement Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income Consolidated and Company Balance Sheets Consolidated and Company Cash Flow Statements 108 Consolidated and Company Statements of Changes in Equity 109 Notes to the Financial Statements 110 THE BOWER London EC1 HELICAL PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 101 GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION STRATEGIC REPORT AUDIT RISK HOW WE RESPONDED TO THE RISK Revenue recognition The risk The revenue cycle includes fraudulent transactions.
Under International Standard on Auditing UK and Ireland 240 The auditors responsibilities relating to fraud in an audit of financial statements there is a presumed risk that revenue may be misstated owing to the improper recognition of revenue.
The group has complex contracts for which the timing and quantum of revenue recognition require the exercise of management judgement.
Dependent upon the nature of the contract this risk applies to development property profit share of results of joint ventures and net gain on sale and revaluation of investment properties.
We therefore identified revenue recognition as a risk requiring special audit consideration.
Our audit work included but was not restricted to evaluating the Groups revenue recognition policies to confirm that they comply with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and have been applied consistently agreeing on a sample basis net rental income to managing agents reports and the underlying lease agreements testing all investment property and residential unit sales and profits in retirement villages and development property sales and profits on a sample basis to completion statements and proceeds received and assessing the appropriateness of judgements exercised by management in respect of complex contracts.
The Groups accounting policy on revenue recognition is shown in note 37 and related disclosures regarding revenues and profits are included in notes 2345 and 18.
The Audit and Risk Committee identified revenue recognition as a significant issue in its report on pages 78 and 79 where the Committee also described the action that it has taken to address this issue.
Our findings Based on our audit work we are satisfied that the judgements made and assumptions used by management in determining the revenue recognised were balanced and supported by the evidence obtained from our testing.
OUR OPINION ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS UNMODIFIED In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Groups and of the Parent Companys affairs as at 31 March 2017 and of the Groups profit for the year then ended the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and as regards the Group financial statements Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
WHO WE ARE REPORTING TO This report is made solely to the Companys members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Companys members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors report and for no other purpose.
To the fullest extent permitted by law we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Companys members as a body for our audit work for this report or for the opinions we have formed.
WHAT WE HAVE AUDITED Helical plcs financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017 comprise the Consolidated Income Statement the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income the Consolidated and Company Balance Sheets the Consolidated and Company Cash Flow Statements the Consolidated and Company Statements of Changes in Equity and the related notes.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as regards the Parent Company financial statements as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
OVERVIEW OF OUR AUDIT APPROACH Overall group materiality 12.7m which represents 1% of the Groups total assets In addition we applied lower materiality of 2m to all income statement items above operating profit excluding share of joint ventures gain or loss on investment properties net gain on sale and revaluation of investment properties and impairment of available for sale investments based on 5% of profit before tax for the year We performed full scope audit procedures at all material locations and Key audit risks were identified as revenue recognition and investment property valuation.
OUR ASSESSMENT OF RISK In arriving at our opinions set out in this report we highlight the following risks that in our judgement had the greatest effect on our audit HELICAL PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 102
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF HELICAL PLC AUDIT RISK HOW WE RESPONDED TO THE RISK Investment property valuation The risk Investment properties with a fair value of 1003m are not valued appropriately.
Investment property is held at fair value under International Accounting Standard IAS 40.
The fair value of all of the Groups investment properties is determined based on level 3 fair value inputs as defined by IFRS 13 Fair value measurement which means that the inputs used in valuing investment properties are unobservable and are therefore subject to estimation.
In determining a propertys valuation the valuers take into account property specific information such as the current tenancy agreements and rental income.
They apply assumptions for yields and estimated market rent which are influenced by prevailing market yields and comparable market transactions to arrive at the final valuation.
For developments classified as investment properties the residual appraisal method is used by estimating the fair value of the completed project less estimated costs to complete.
We therefore identified investment property valuation as a risk requiring special audit consideration.
Our audit work included but was not restricted to examining the qualifications and experience of the Groups independent external valuers and whether the basis of their valuations was consistent with the RICS red book as required by IAS 40 evaluating evidence of the reliability of valuation estimations by comparing the historical trend of investment property sales with the related carrying values obtaining the information provided by management to the independent valuers to confirm it was consistent with information obtained during our audit analysis of year on year valuation movements including discussion of any outliers with both management and the independent valuers benchmarking for outlier properties identified by the analysis above valuation yields used in the external valuations to yields for comparable published market data and seeking further corroboration for those that fall outside a predetermined range discussions with the independent valuers used to understand and assess the appropriateness of the estimates assumptions and valuation methodology used and ensuring that valuations are reviewed and approved by the Valuations Committee through review of minutes and discussions with the Chair of the Committee.
The Groups accounting policy on investment properties is shown in note 37 and related disclosures are included in note 14.
The Audit and Risk Committee identified investment property valuation as a significant issue in its report on pages 78 and 79 where the Committee also described the action that it has taken to address this issue.
Our findings We were satisfied that investment property valuations were made by suitably qualified independent valuers using information provided by management that is consistent with information obtained during our audit and the judgements made and assumptions used by the valuers in determining the investment property valuations were balanced and supported by the evidence obtained from our testing.
GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION STRATEGIC REPORT HELICAL PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 103 OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY AND AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced.
We use materiality in determining the nature timing and extent of our audit work and in evaluating the results of that work.
We determined materiality for the audit of the Group financial statements as a whole to be 12.7m which is 1% of the Groups total assets 1% of the Groups net assets in the year ended 31 March 2016.
We concluded that determining materiality based on the Groups total assets most appropriately reflects the ownership and valuation of investment properties of interest to the users of the financial statements which is a key area of audit focus.
In addition we applied lower materiality of 2m to all consolidated income statement items above operating profit excluding share of joint ventures gain or loss on investment properties net gain on sale and revaluation of investment properties and impairment of available for sale investments based on 5% of the Groups profit before tax for the year.
We believe misstatement of these specific income statement items of a lesser amount than materiality for the financial statements as a whole could reasonably be expected to influence the Companys members assessment of the financial performance of the Group.
We also apply a lower level of specific materiality for certain areas such as Directors remuneration and related party transactions.
We use a different level of materiality performance materiality to drive the extent of our testing and this was set at 75% of financial statement materiality for the audit of the Group financial statements.
We determined the threshold at which we will communicate misstatements to the Audit and Risk Committee to be 625000 except that all misstatements of Directors remuneration and related party transactions are communicated.
In addition we communicate misstatements below that threshold that in our view warrant reporting on qualitative grounds.
OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT A description of the generic scope of an audit of financial statements is provided on the Financial Reporting Councils website at www. rc.
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing ISAs UK and Ireland.
Our
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Auditing Practices Boards Ethical Standards for Auditors and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those Ethical Standards.
In order to address the audit risks described above as identified during our planning procedures we performed a full scope audit of the financial statements of the Parent Company Helical plc and of the financial information of all the Groups operations.
For Group reporting purposes a group materiality is adopted for all subsidiary entities within the Group unless there are specific reasons for adopting an entity materiality for example where a subsidiary is partially owned by a third party.
There are no separate Group components subject to audit by auditors other than the Group audit team.

Other timing differences include deferred tax assets arising from the recognition of the fair value of derivative financial instruments and future tax relief available to the Group from capital allowances and when share awards vest.
A debit of 2062000 2016 3002000 in respect of future tax relief for share awards has been recognised in reserves in accordance with IAS 12.
The Group contains entities with tax losses for which no deferred tax asset is recognised.
The total unrecognised losses amount to approximately 10621000 2016 9026000.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised because the entities in which the losses have been generated either do not have forecast taxable profits or the losses have restrictions whereby their utilisation is considered to be unlikely.
If upon sale of the investment properties the Group retained all the capital allowances the deferred tax provision in respect of capital allowances of 2969000 2016 1946000 would be released and further capital allowances of 31390000 2016 20340000 would be available to reduce future tax liabilities.
The net deferred tax asset in respect of other timing differences arises from tax relief available to the Group on the marktomarket valuation of financial instruments the future vesting of share awards and other timing differences.

EARNINGS PER SHARE The calculation of the basic earnings per share is based on the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
This is a different basis to the net asset per share calculations which are based on the number of shares at the year end.
Shares held by the Helical Employees Share Ownership Plan Trust the ESOP which has waived its entitlement to receive dividends are treated as cancelled for the purpose of this calculation.
The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on the basic earnings per share adjusted to allow for the issue of shares and the post tax effect of dividends on the assumed exercise of all dilutive options.
The EPRA earnings per share is calculated in accordance with IAS 33 and the best practice recommendations of the European Public Real Estate Association EPRA.

Interest capitalised in respect of the refurbishment of investment properties is included in investment properties to the extent of 10972000 2016 6571000.
Investment properties with a total fair value of 993900000 2016 945400000 were held as security against borrowings.
All of the Groups properties are level 3 as defined by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement in the fair value hierarchy as at 31 March 2017 and there were no transfers between levels during the year.
Level 3 inputs used in valuing the properties are those which are unobservable as opposed to level 1 inputs from quoted prices and level 2 observable inputs either directly ie as prices or indirectly ie derived from prices.
Transfers into and transfers out of the fair value hierarchy levels are recognised on the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.
Valuation Methodology The fair value of the Groups investment property as at 31 March 2017 was determined by independent external valuers at that date except for investment properties valued by the Directors.
The valuations are in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS Valuation  Professional Standards The Red Book and the International Valuation Standards and were arrived at by reference to market transactions for similar properties.
Fair values for investment properties are calculated using the present value income approach.
The main assumptions underlying the valuations are in relation to rent profile and yields as discussed below.
A key driver of the property valuations is the terms of the leases in place at the valuation date.
These determine the cash flow profile of the property for a number of years.
The valuation assumes adjustments from these rental values to current market rent at the time of the next rent review where a typical lease allows only for upward adjustment and as leases expire and are replaced by new leases.
The current market level of rent is assessed based on evidence provided by the most recent relevant leasing transactions and negotiations.
The nominal equivalent yield is applied as a discount rate to the rental cash flows which after taking into account other input assumptions such as vacancies and costs generates the market value of the property.
The equivalent yield applied is assessed by reference to market transactions for similar properties and takes into account amongst other things any risks associated with the rent uplift assumptions.
The net initial yield is calculated as the current net income over the gross market value of the asset and is used as a sense check and to compare against market transactions for similar properties.
The valuation output along with inputs and assumptions are reviewed to ensure these are in line with what a market participant would use when pricing each asset.
The reversionary yield is the return received from an asset once the estimated rental value has been captured on todays assessment of market value.
There are interrelationships between all the inputs as they are determined by market conditions.
The existence of an increase in more than one input would be to magnify the input on the valuation.
The impact on the valuation will be mitigated by the interrelationship of two inputs in opposite directions.
Details of the investment portfolio yields can be found on page 46 and in Appendix 5 of this report.
The graph below illustrates the sensitivity of the value of the investment portfolio to the reversionary yield.

Ordinary 50%  Development Creechurch Place Limited Jersey Ordinary 10%  Development Significant Judgements and Estimates There are a number of companies which are accounted for as joint ventures where the Group has an equity interest of less than 50%.
This typically occurs where the Groups joint venture partner is providing a greater share of finance into the Company with the Group contributing a greater share towards the day to day management of the underlying project.
In these cases neither party has control over the entity and therefore it is considered appropriate to account for our interest as a joint venture.
Under the Barts Square joint venture agreement the Group is entitled to varying returns dependent upon the performance of the development.
Whilst the Group holds a 33.35% legal share in the Barts Square group it has accounted for its share at 43.8% to reflect its expected economic interest in the joint venture.
This changed in the year to 31 March 2016 from the 33.35% interest shown at 31 March 2015 and resulted in a gain of 6341000 being recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement to reflect the Groups increased share in the opening net assets of the joint venture.
Under the Creechurch joint venture arrangement whilst the Group holds a legal share of 10% of Creechurch Place Limited a third party acquired the right to step in to take 20% of the Groups share of the effective economic interest ie 2%.
Therefore the Group changed the share of joint venture that it accounted for from 10% to 8%.

Interest rate swaps 13981 14955 Convertible Bond derivative element   2551 7134 13981 14955 2551 7134 The Groups movement in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments in the year was a gain of 789000 2016 loss of 6860000 due to interest rate caps and swaps.
In accordance with IAS 39 the convertible bond is split into a loan and derivative element in the Company Balance Sheet.
On initial recognition the derivative element had a value of 8190000.
At 31 March 2017 the derivative element had a value of 2551000 2016 7134000 with a corresponding gain of 4583000 2016 2048000 recognised in the Income Statement.
The Companys interest rate swaps were novated to a subsidiary company during the year 2016 gain of 1898000.
Credit Risk Credit risks arise from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed.
To manage this risk the Group periodically assesses the financial reliability of customers taking into account their financial position past experience and other factors.
As at 31 March 2017 the Group had total credit risk exposure excluding cash of 73260000 all of which is loans and receivables.
The cash is held with reputable banking institutions and in client accounts with solicitors and managing agents and therefore credit risk is considered low.
All other debtors are deemed to be recoverable.
All Company debtors are considered to be fully recoverable.
The Group is not reliant on any major customer for its ability to continue as a going concern.
For further information on trade and other receivables see note 21.
Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group would not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price.
Liquidity and funding risks related processes and policies are overseen by management.
The Group manages its liquidity risk on a consolidated basis based on business needs tax capital or regulatory considerations if applicable and through numerous sources of finance in order to maintain flexibility.
Management monitors the Groups net liquidity position through rolling forecasts on the basis of expected cash flows.
The Groups cash and cash equivalents are held with major regulated financial institutions and the Directors regularly monitor the financial institutions that the Group uses to ensure its exposure to liquidity risk is minimised.
For further information on debt facilities see notes 24 and 25.
The maturity profile of the Groups contracted financial liabilities is as follows
Group
Company
Company
Payable within 3 months 42722 51204 441308 518956 Payable between 3 months and 1 year 31259 34817 7220 7220 Payable between 1 and 3 years 356708 65602 111119 19032 Payable after 3 years 383217 760795 86663 178099 Total contracted liabilities 813906 912418 646310 723307 At 31 March 2017 the Group had 141918000 2016 83641000 of undrawn borrowing facilities 16847000 2016 105865000 of uncharged property assets and cash balances of 99262000 2016 74670000.
The above contracted liabilities assume that no loans are extended beyond their current facility expiry date.
Management believe that these facilities together with anticipated sales and the renewal of some of these loan facilities mean that the Group can meet its contracted liabilities as they fall due.
Market Risk The Group is exposed to market risk primarily related to interest rates foreign currency exchange movements the market value of the investments and accrued development profits.
The Group actively monitors these exposures.
Interest Rate Risk It is the Groups policy and practice to minimise interest rate cash flow exposures on longterm financing.
The Group does this by using a number of derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps and interest rate caps.
The purpose of these derivatives is to manage the interest rate risks arising from the Groups sources of finance.
The Group does not use financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Details of financing and financial instruments can be found in note 25.
In the year to 31 March 2017 if interest rates had moved by 0.5% this would have resulted in the following movement to net profits and equity due to movements in interest charges and marktomarket valuations of derivatives.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION STRATEGIC REPORT HELICAL PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 131 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 37.
PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate those of Helical plc the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings together the Group drawn up to 31 March 2017.
Subsidiary undertakings are entities for which the Group is exposed to variable returns and has the ability to control those returns.
Subsidiaries are accounted for under the purchase method and are held in the Company balance sheet at cost and reviewed annually for impairment.
Joint Ventures are entities whose economic activities are controlled jointly by the Group and by other ventures independent of the Group where both parties are exposed to variable returns but neither has control over those returns.
They are accounted for using the equity method of accounting whereby the Groups share of profit after tax in the Joint Venture is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement and the Groups share of the Joint Ventures net assets are incorporated in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The Companys cost of investment in Joint Ventures less any provision for permanent impairment loss is shown in the Company Balance Sheet.
Associates are those entities over which the Group has significant influence but which are neither subsidiaries nor joint ventures.
Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains on transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries and between subsidiaries are eliminated.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling which is also the functional currency of the parent company.
Going Concern The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis as explained in the Governance Review on page 74.
Revenue Recognition Rental income  rental income receivable is recognised in the Income Statement on a straightline basis over the lease term.
Any incentive for lessees to enter into a lease agreement and any costs associated with entering into the lease are spread over the same period.
Sale of goods  assets such as trading properties development sites and completed developments are regarded as sold upon the transfer of the significant risks and rewards of ownership to the purchaser in accordance with IAS 18 Revenue.
This occurs on exchange of unconditional contracts for the sale of the site on satisfaction of any and all conditions on a conditional contract for the sale of the site or on completion of the contract on a conditional sale where those conditions are satisfied at completion.
Measurements of revenue arising from the sale of such assets are derived from the fair value of the consideration received in accordance with IAS 18 Revenue.
Construction contracts  where an asset is constructed under a specific contract with a purchaser a presold development the initial sale of the site to that purchaser is recognised as a sale of goods in accordance with IAS 18 Revenue where the sale of the land is not conditional on the construction of the buildings and is not reversible in the event that the building is not constructed.
The construction element of the contract is treated for the purposes of revenue recognition as a construction contract in accordance with IAS 11 Construction Contracts.
Revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion which is typically determined by reference to project appraisals normally supported by independent valuation certificates provided by quantity surveyors.
The Companys principal other responsibility on presold developments is the identification of and agreement of terms with potential tenants of the completed buildings.
The revenue recognition of this additional component of the funding agreements is considered separately to reflect the substance of the transaction as the rendering of services in accordance with IAS 18 Revenue.
The amount of revenue recognised is determined by reference to the percentage of the buildings that are let.
Property advisorydevelopment management services  where the Group provides these services to the third party property site owner the Group recognises income over the period these services are provided and in accordance with the specific terms of the contract.
If the amount and payment of the consideration for these services are contingent upon a future event such as sale of the property and if the fair value of the consideration can be reliably estimated the Group recognises this income as its services are performed discounting for time and risk if appropriate.
Investment income  revenue in respect of investment and other income represents investment income fees and commissions earned on an accruals basis and the fair value of the consideration receivedreceivable on investments held for the shortterm.
Dividends are recognised when the Shareholders right to receive payment has been established.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate.
Deferred income  money received in advance of the provision of goods or services is held in the balance sheet until the income can be recognised in the Income Statement.
Sharebased Payments The Group provides sharebased payments in the form of performance share plan awards and a share incentive plan.
These payments are discussed in greater detail in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 80 to 97.
The fair value of sharebased payments related to employees service are determined indirectly by reference to the fair value of the related instrument at the grant date.
The Group uses a combination of the BlackScholes and stochastic valuation models and the resulting value is amortised through the Consolidated Income Statement Income Statement over the vesting period of the sharebased payments.
For the performance share plan and share incentive plan awards where nonmarket conditions apply the expense is allocated over the vesting period to the Income Statement based on the best available estimate of the number of awards that are expected to vest.
Estimates are subsequently revised if there is any indication that the number of awards expected to vest differs from previous estimates.
The amount charged to the Income Statement is credited to the Retained Earnings reserve.
Depreciation
In accordance with IAS 40 Investment Property depreciation is not provided for on freehold investment properties or on leasehold investment properties.
The Group does not own the freehold land and buildings which it occupies.
Costs incurred in respect of NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HELICAL PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 132 leasehold improvements to the Groups head office at 5 Hanover Square London W1S 1HQ are capitalised and held as shortterm leasehold improvements.
Leasehold improvements plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Residual values are reassessed annually.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets less residual value over their estimated useful lives using the straightline method on the following basis Short leasehold improvements  10% or length of lease if shorter Plant and equipment 25%
The taxation charge represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The charge for current taxation is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items which are nonassessable or disallowed.
It is calculated using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Tax payable upon realisation of revaluation gains recognised in prior periods is recorded as a current tax charge with a release of the associated deferred taxation.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable timing differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible timing differences can be utilised.
The measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities reflects the tax consequences of the manner in which the Group expects at the balance sheet date to recover or settle the carrying amount of those assets and liabilities.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the timing differences arise from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the assets to be recovered.
The deferred tax asset relating to share based payment awards reflects the estimated value of tax relief available on the vesting of the awards at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
It is recognised in the Income Statement except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
The Group recognises a deferred tax liability for all taxable timing differences associated with investments in subsidiaries associates and interests in joint ventures except to the extent that both of the following conditions are satisfied a the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the timing difference and b it is probable that the timing difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Dividends
Dividend distributions to the Companys Shareholders are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which dividends are approved.
Investment Properties Investment properties are properties owned or leased by the Group which are held for longterm rental income and for capital appreciation.
Investment properties are initially recognised at cost including associated transaction costs and subsequently at fair value adjusted for the carrying value of lease incentive and letting cost receivables.
These fair values are based on market values as determined by professionally qualified external valuers or are determined by the Directors of the Group based on their knowledge of the property.
In accordance with IAS 40 investment properties held under leases are stated gross of the recognised finance lease liability.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment properties are recognised as gains or losses on revaluation in the Income Statement of the period in which they arise.
In accordance with IAS 40 as the Group uses the fair value model no depreciation is provided in respect of investment properties including integral plant.
Property that is being constructed or developed for future use as an investment property is treated as investment property in accordance with IAS 40.
When the Group redevelops an existing investment property for continued future use as investment property the property remains an investment property measured at fair value and is not reclassified.
Interest is capitalised before tax relief until the date of practical completion.
Details of the valuation of investment properties can be found in note 14.
Land Developments and Trading Properties Land developments and trading properties held for sale are inventory and are included in the Balance Sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less estimated costs to completion and estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Gross borrowing costs associated with expenditure on properties under development or undergoing major refurbishment are capitalised.
The interest capitalised is either based on the interest paid where a project has a specific loan or calculated using the Groups weighted average cost of borrowings where there are no specific borrowings for the project.
Interest is capitalised from the date of commencement of the development work until date of practical completion.

Purchases and sales of own shares increase or decrease the book value of Own shares held in the Balance Sheet.
At each period end the Group assesses and recognises the value of Own shares held with reference to the expected cash proceeds and accounts for any difference as a reserves transfer.
Use of Estimates and Judgements To be able to prepare accounts according to the accounting principles management must make estimates and assumptions that affect the assets and liabilities and revenue and expense amounts recorded in the financial statements.
These estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions that management and the Board of Directors believe are reasonable under the particular circumstances.
The results of these considerations form the basis for making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.
Areas requiring the use of estimates and critical judgement that may significantly impact the Groups earnings and financial position are
Recognition of sharebased payments which is dependent upon the estimated number of performance share plan awards that will vest at the end of the periods based on future forecast performance and employee retention note 28.
The 2014 award is an actual figure therefore the estimation is around 2015 and 2016 vesting percentages.
As at March 2017 the estimated vesting percentage for 2015 was 42.57% and for 2016 was 33.33%.
These have been sensitised for a range of reasonably possible vesting outcomes.
If it was estimated that nil% of the remaining shares were expected to vest it would result in a credit to the Consolidated Income Statement of 1.8m and if it was estimated that 100% were expected to vest it would result in a 2.8m additional charge.
10% variation in the estimated vesting % would result in a 0.5m chargecredit recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Determination of the most appropriate percentage interest at which to recognise our share of joint ventures where our economic interest can differ to our ownership interest see note 18.
Under the Barts Square joint venture agreement the Group is entitled to varying returns dependent upon the performance of the development.
Whilst the Group holds a 33.35% legal share in the Barts Square group it has accounted for its share at 43.8% to reflect its expected economic interest in the joint venture.
There are several estimates that contribute to this expected economic interest the most sensitive of which is the estimated sales price of the residential units.
If the estimated sales prices were 15% lower the Groups economic interest would fall to 42.0% with a net asset decrease of 0.9m whilst an increase of 15% would result in a 48.4% economic interest with a net asset increase of 2.2m.
Valuation of investment properties.
The sensitivity of these valuations to changes in the reversionary yield is included in note 14 The net realisable value of land and development properties contain subjective assumptions including the results of future planning decisions future construction costs and future sales values and timings note 19.
We do not consider the range of reasonably possible outcomes for changes in estimated cost or sales price would result in a material impact to net realisable value and Determination of the stage of completion of development management projects which impact the amount of development management revenue.
There are no changes in assumptions for which the reasonably possible outcomes would have a material impact on the revenue recognised in the year.
Judgements
Calculation and assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets where it has been assumed that sufficient taxable profits will be available in future periods to allow all of the assets to be recovered note 10 An assessment of the most suitable accounting treatment for convertible bonds note 24 Consideration of the nature of joint arrangements.
In the context of IFRS 10 this involves consideration of where the control lies and whether either party has the power to vary its returns from the arrangements.
In particular significant judgement is exercised where the shareholding of the Group is not 50% note 18 Consideration of whether an investment property purchase that has exchanged but not completed should be recognised as investment property under IAS 40.
The judgement lies in assessing whether the exchange is unconditional in which case it is recognised note 14 and Recognition of development management project revenue where payment for these services is triggered by a future event sale or letting of the property.
