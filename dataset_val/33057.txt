The LiDCOplus sensor LiDCO has developed a proprietary lithium sensor using lithium indicator dilution to calculate cardiac output.
This is used to calibrate the LiDCOplus monitor .
Safe and extremely accurate this method is simple to perform taking less than five minutes for the entire procedure.
3 LiDCO Group plc Annual Report January 2005 Chairmans review Theresa Wallis The 13 months to 31 January 2005 saw a high level of activity and progress on several fronts.
A significant new development was the expansion of LiDCOs international distributor network.
In the US this was possible because of the groundwork conducted by our direct US sales force.
It has established the market for our products setting pricing and sales models.
In Europe final regulatory approvals received in late 2004 and continuing into 2005 in a number of countries opened the way to appointing distributors in several European territories and initiating sales activity there.
In the UK US continental Europe and Japan we continued to encourage and support product validation studies by recognised opinion formers.
Meanwhile the Companys Londonbased manufacturing facility continued to produce a growing number of proprietary sensors efficiently and to the high standards required by the industry .
The facility has the double benefit of providing a substantial increase in capacity with only marginal additional cost.
Having set the price for our monitors through direct sales activity  we started to shift our US sales strategy in 2004 from a capital sales model to one predominantly based on annuity revenues.
This consists of an upfront charge rental and fee per use revenues.
The advantage of this approach is that it enables a larger number of hospitals to benefit from our minimally invasive hemodynamic monitoring system at a cost that is linked to usage and is therefore easier to justify to those budget holders who are not in a position to approve a capital sale. our products in 2001.
As expected given the targeted shift in our sales model from a capital sales model to an annuity sales model headline turnover slipped but excluding a large distributor stocking order from Japan in 2003 sales in 2004 were 37% higher than in 2003 reflecting strong healthy growth in sales of monitors and sensors.
Careful cost control enabled administrative costs to be held at 6 million.
In June a placing of 3.7 million net was completed to provide additional working capital to support new US German and Austrian distributor programmes and additional research and development.
During the year a nonexclusive partnership agreement was signed with Philips Medical Systems.
Hemodynamic monitoring data gathered from patients using LiDCOs systems can be fed into the Philips IntelliVue Patient Monitor  a patient information system used in many of our target hospitals.
Other recently developed links also enable our systems to connect directly to hospitals own information systems an increasingly important feature as the NHS and other healthcare providers move towards an electronic patient record system.
The recently announced results of the St Georges Hospital outcome study are we believe of particular significance to the Companys future development.
We believe that the study  which used LiDCOplus monitors makes the clearest business and humanitarian case ever made for the adoption of hemodynamic monitoring for the treatment of high risk surgery patients saving on average over ten hospital bed days per patient.
The Company is therefore well placed to accelerate penetration of our target markets for hemodynamic monitoring systems.
In order to ensure that full advantage is taken of this opportunity maximum effort and commitment will be required on the part of the Companys employees and management.
F or this reason the Board has decided to undertake a restructuring of its long term incentive programme.
New Bridge Street Consultants LLP is advising the Board on this area.
I would like to take this opportunity to extend my thanks to the management and staff of LiDCO for all their dedication hard work and enthusiasm and to our scientific advisory panel for their valuable support.
Theresa Wallis
17 May 2005 The Company is well placed to accelerate penetration of our target markets for hemodynamic monitoring systems.
LiDCO Group plc Annual Report January 2005 4 FI In a major trial at St.
Georges Hospital London the LiDCO minimally invasive cardiovascular monitoring technology was used to both measure blood flow and increase oxygen delivery in surgery patients.
The results were clear Savings in the cost of treating patients amounting to an average of 4000 per patient.
Extrapolated nationally this would equate to a saving of 500 million per annum for the NHS.
The monetary saving  248000  resulted from 640 hospital days saved for 62 patients an average of more than 10 bed days per patient.
The savings in cost and time were associated with a significant reduction in medical complications.
Once we found out it was simple and easy to do we could implement it immediately in our practice.
Jayne F awcett RN MSc T eam Leader St Georges Hospital London focused on significant savings and improved patient care OUTCOME STUDY GOAL DIRECTED THERAPY ST.
GEORGES HOSPITAL LONDON 5 LiDCO Group plc Annual Report January 2005 . growth rate of 8.
9% hospitals will continue to allocate a significant percentage 3040% of their resources to critical care patients.
There remains a growing need for advances in cardiovascular monitoring and the care of such hospital patients.
The size of the available market therefore is not in doubt.
The challenge for LiDCO in 200405 was to get into the position where the Company could fully exploit the potential for its technology to meet this growing need.
Therefore it was key to complete residual registration activities in a number of new territories and appoint additional distributors in these territories.
These activities have now been concluded successfully .
Following product approvals the publication of independent clinical studies showing both patient and economic benefits is crucial to the development of the minimally invasive monitoring market.
With this in mind I am pleased to report that during the year  a number of trials using LiDCOs technology have concluded positively .
Of these trials the most powerful report was the one presented on 22 March 2005 at the 25th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine in Brussels  following the conclusion of a prospective controlled trial conducted by St.
Georges Hospital London.
This trial has demonstrated that better post operative intensive care can be achieved with the use of LiDCOs minimally invasive technology and importantly that such care translates into benefits for both the patient and cost savings for the healthcare provider .
The savings achieved through adoption of this approach to the hospital per year have been estimated at 2 million.
This represents a saving of 4000 per patient through an average reduction in stay of more than ten bed days per patient treated.
It has been estimated that if this form of advanced cardiovascular care was implemented throughout the UK savings of up to 500 million per annum could be achieved for the NHS.
Business review
During the period we have made significant advances in the development of a truly worldwide sales and distribution network.
In order to do so a number of regulatory milestones were reached in 2004 and in early 2005.
We have paid particular attention to the European market  as this is the most developed territory for the adoption of advanced minimally invasive cardiovascular monitoring.
We have received full approvals for marketing in eight additional territories Italy  Germany Austria Norway  Sweden Denmark Ireland and Bulgaria.
These latest registrations now provide LiDCO with full marketing approval in 13 European countries.
F ollowing these additional registrations we are now selling product in a greatly expanded group of territories Germany  Austria Italy  Sweden Holland Belgium Denmark Czech Republic Croatia Spain Sweden Norway and the
We expect continued and significant sales growth in Europe during 2005.
We also extended our sales reach in the US signing agreements with five regional distributors.
We are supporting these distributors with our direct sales staff and will continue to appoint additional organisations throughout 2005.
Our
Chief Executives review T erry OBrien Hospitals will always need to maintain a high standard of patient care which means a constant need for the latest technology despite budget restraints.
LiDCO Group plc Annual Report January 2005 6 focused on realtime beat to beat display of critical parameters ambition is to achieve full coverage of the US market through a mixed direct and distributor sales force.
In May 2004 the Company announced it had contracted with Philips Medical Systems Philips to create a communications link between LiDCOs proprietary  standalone monitoring system LiDCOplus Monitor and Philips patient monitors via the Philips Open VueLink Interface protocol.
The communications link allows Philips customers access to LiDCOs proprietary minimallyinvasive hemodynamic monitoring data on the IntelliVue Patient Monitor .
The integration of critical care parameters and hemodynamic data derived from the LiDCOplus monitor will allow a fuller picture of the patients condition and history to be displayed and accessed throughout the hospital.
I am pleased to say that this communication link software has now been completed and launched.
In addition for those hospitals without Phillips monitors we have provided a real time ethernet based communication feature.
This means that LiDCO monitors can now be interfaced through both proprietary and inexpensive non proprietary protocols.
This is a major step forward as hospital information systems can now be updated with LiDCOs oxygen delivery data shown by the St.
Georges trial to be fundamental to improving outcomes for surgical patients.
We believe that there is a growing requirement from intensive care staff and the hospital administration for the provision and clinical audit of such crucial information.
Our experience is that interconnectivity of hemodynamic monitors to hospital information systems is becoming a key part of the hemodynamic monitor purchase specification.
Our PC based monitor approach is highly flexible and able to accommodate this developing requirement.
Trading review Sales margins and placing In the period turnover was modestly down in comparison to 2003.
This was a consequence of our continuing strategy to promote monitor rental and disposable sales at the expense of oneoff revenues from capital sales to distributors and hospitals.
Revenues in 2003 were also boosted by the receipt of an initial 0.7 million stocking order from Japan.
Thus the overall revenue figure disguises the underlying strong growth of revenue in Europe and the US  which was increased by 32% over the previous year .
This reflects continued encouraging levels of disposable usage and the expansion in the installed monitor base up 30% from 591 to 770 systems.
Overall disposable sales increased strongly in the period  up by 87%.
Thus
2004 was the fourth year in succession where we have seen such growth in recurring revenue.
These more predictable revenues from sales of disposables fee for use and rentals now account for the majority 64% of total revenue  see T able 1.
As disposable sales increase in existing markets and territories that were added in the second half of the year the Company expects continued strong recurring revenue growth in 2005.
We continue to make progress in the USA which represents 46% of our installed base of monitors.
We expect that in addition to the sales achieved by our own sales team there will be a growing contribution from the five US regional agents who following training are starting to make an impact on income.
The global interest in minimally invasive technology is supported by the widespread distribution of our installed base of monitors US 46% Europe 35% ROW 17%.
The slightly increased operating loss for the period reflects the modestly reduced turnover with administration expenses held at just below the previous years figure.
Cost controls have been maintained and the underlying monthly cash usage is steady despite servicing a larger distributor sales organisation in a considerably expanded number of territories.
Our expectation is that the installed base of monitors 770 as at 31 January 2005 will continue to increase and our first commercial milestone of an installed base of 1000 monitors looks within reach during 2005.
In order to support the sales expansion in the US and Continental Europe and to finance product development the Company concluded a placing of shares in June raising approximately 3.7 million net.
It was gratifying to see a number of our existing investors supporting this financing round and at the same time we were able to welcome a number of new institutional investors.
Hospitals will always need to maintain a high standard of patient care  which means a constant need for the latest technology  despite budget restraints.
In January 2005 LiDCO signed an 7 LiDCO Group plc Annual Report January 2005 agreement with a major US finance house  a leading provider of equipment acquisition solutions for acutecare hospitals throughout the United States and Canada.
We will use the flexible leasing programs on offer to help sell equipment to US hospital customers via leasing programs that give hospitals the ability to obtain equipment immediately and pay for it in monthly instalments.
The provision of this facility greatly enhances the ability of our sales team and agents to provide appropriate financing solutions for our customers.
US
T urnover in 2004 was 935000 2003 754000 an increase of 2 4% despite an adverse currency impact from the weakening dollar of 131000.
Currency adjusted turnover 1.1 million shows an increase of 41%.
Capital sales of monitors represented 27% of systems placed in the period 2003 58%.
The number of monitors placed and sales of sensors fees for use increased by 36% and 111% respectively compared to 2003. within the US.
The training of their staff took place during the second half of 2004 and sales have commenced.
Further appointments of US agents are expected in 2005.
Given the lengthy US capital sales cycle the rental consignment model was introduced during the last quarter of 2003 to accelerate market penetration of our monitoring systems alongside the existing capital sales option and sales through higher charges on disposables Upcharge.
Under this new model customers are charged a fee each time they use the LiDCOplus software but pay no up front fee for the monitor .
Furthermore they can costeffectively calibrate their installed LiDCOplus system using third party products as well as LiDCO sensors thereby further increasing the range of clinical situations in which our monitors can be used.
With this sales model we have had successes at a number of US hospitals where we have been able to provide advanced realtime cardiovascular monitoring while still saving the hospital money against their existing revenue budget for invasive monitoring.
UK
T urnover in the UK increased by 32% to 930000 2003 706000 with both monitor placements and sensor numbers increasing by 64%.
Sales in the UK are made via a direct sales force of seven people ensuring that LiDCOis kept in direct contact with clinical developments in the critical care community and can rapidly adapt its products to meet changing demands.
As in the US a variety of sales models are also used in the UK with hospitals able to select from simple capital purchase up charged sensor prices but no capital purchase or  more recently a feeforuse programme.
The flexibility offered to NHS hospitals assists them in the acquisition of the LiDCO technology according to local budgetary and planning circumstances.
We expect sales growth in the UK to be accelerated through adoption of the protocol for improving outcome in high risk surgery patients pioneered at
Georges hospital.

This will allow many more hospitals around the world to achieve significant improvement in patient care and reduction of complication related costs.
The LiDCOplus monitor  with its ability to connect to other primary patient monitors helps us to improve our patient care by showing all the key clinical information we need on one screen.

THOMAS HOSPITAL LONDON 9 LiDCO Group plc Annual Report January 2005 Chief Executives review continued Continental Europe T urnover for the period was 386000 an increase of 55% 2003 2 49000.
With the first wave of mutual recognition approvals only achieved in late 2003 first sales into continental Europe started in earnest in mid 2004.
The registration process has continued with second wave approvals received in the first quarter of 2005.
There are now 13 European territories open to LiDCO and its products with further European approvals scheduled for 2006.
Sales in Europe are made via a network of distributors supported by LiDCO staff based in the UK and Northern
The market for less invasive cardiovascular monitoring is most advanced in Europe compared to the rest of the world and interest in adopting minimally invasive monitoring is strong.
We expect significant sales growth in 2005.
F ar East Japan and the Rest of the World Sales in the F ar East Japan and the Rest of the World totalled 204000 2003 822000.
Adjusting for the oneoff stocking order received from our Japanese distributor in 2003 700000 reveals a sales increase in territories outside of Japan.
In Japan following their purchase of an initial stocking order of 100 monitors in 2003 our distributor Nipro have established a number of key clinical reference sites for our technology .
The strategy is to concentrate on these centres initially and then expand sales through local referrals.
The market for real time hemodynamic monitoring is less well developed in Japan when compared to Europe  2005 will therefore represent a year where the product advantages are still being established by our distributor partner .
We therefore expect modest sales during this market development period.
Research and development and product application Focus on improving hospital patient outcomes and reducing costs Our core development activities centre on the acquisition and intelligent display through a platform PC based monitor  of combinations of measurements that have been proven to influence hospital patient outcomes positively  and thereby reduce costs.
The advantages to be obtained through targeting one such parameter oxygen delivery have already been demonstrated.
LiDCO believe that there will be an increasing recognition of the advantages of this form of hemodynamic driven care.
Hemodynamic driven care and intravenous fluid management The Company expects to add a further software product to simplify and make safer the administration of fluids for rehydration purposes.
Knowing the precise amount of fluids to administer is surprisingly difficult.
T oo little fluid and the oxygen delivery and blood pressure can fall to dangerous levels.
T oo much can result in overloading the circulation and heart resulting in a greatly extended hospital stay .
LiDCO is developing a unique interface allowing the nurse physicianled optimisation of fluid administration to such patients.
This development activity will result in an intelligent fluid administration screen and new software product.
This will not only improve safety but also help in the implementation of early goal directed therapy EGDT in surgery patients.
Looking ahead we are also assessing the potential to use completely noninvasive skin applied sensor technology with the LiDCOplus monitor to identify and optimise highrisk surgery patients.
The USA is the biggest single market and now represents approximately 50% of our potential worldwide sales.
LiDCO Group plc Annual Report January 2005 10 Oxygen delivery and consumption ratio patent application Improved outcomes are achieved when the consumption and delivery of oxygen are well matched  the EGDT
Georges study is an example of where increasing oxygen delivery to pay back an oxygen debt has markedly improved outcome.
T o further simplify the monitoring of the relationship of these two parameters LiDCO have filed a patent on a unique way of calculating and displaying their relationship in a simplified form.
Through such a display the user can be alerted to any deterioration in this key ratio and a menu of appropriate responses is presented e. drug.
It is our intention to add this functionality to our software.
Potential neonatal application for the LiDCOplus monitor Monitoring of cardiovascular status in the unwell preterm baby neonate is mostly limited to the continuous measurement of blood pressure through an umbilical artery catheter .
However these blood pressure values although useful may not accurately reflect actual tissue perfusion with oxygen.
The continuous measurement of cardiac output and estimation of oxygen delivery in these very small babies has not been possible except intermittently by echocardiography .
Researchers from the Clinical Science Department Child Health University of Bristol UK have shown that continuous analysis of cardiac output is possible with the LiDCOplus monitor .
The cardiac output trend derived from our monitor shows a closer correlation to changing tissue oxygen perfusion than standard arterial blood pressure monitoring.
They conclude that This methodology is applicable to the term and preterm infant in assessing cardiovascular function using either a standard umbilical catheter  or a peripheral arterial line.
The LiDCOplus monitor is not registered for use in subjects less than 40 kgs in weight however  this work has encouraged us to further investigate the potential for sales of the LiDCOplus monitor in neonatal intensive care units.
If an attractive business case can be made then the appropriate steps will be taken for registration of this new clinical indication.

Activities
The principal activity of the Group was the development manufacture and sale of cardiac monitoring equipment.
Results and future prospects The Groups turnover for the period was 2456000 2003 2717 000.
The Group made a consolidated loss after taxation during the period of 4199000 2003 3875000.
The Directors do not recommend the payment of a dividend 2003 nil.
At 31 January 2005 the Group held 1.6 million of cash 31 December 2003 1.6 million which provides the Group with adequate funding for its business plan.
In June 2004 the Company issued 3.7 million of new shares net of expenses to enable the US distributor programme to commence to finance additional research and development and to provide additional working capital.
Recent regulatory approvals in Europe and Brazil have opened more markets in Europe and a new one in South America.
This brings to thirteen the number of European territories in which we are registered to sell lithium chloride as well as Brazil  the largest medical market in South America.
With distributors already appointed in these countries we are looking forward to an acceleration of sales through this expanded network of distributors and territories.

Statement of Directors responsibilities United Kingdom company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company as at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing those financial statements the Directors are required to select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed and prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for systems of internal control safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Going concern After making reasonable enquiries and performing analysis the Directors have formed a judgement at the time of approving the financial statements that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the forseeable future.
On the basis of the anticipated levels of sales costs and cash flow the Directors have satisfied themselves that the level of cash in the business is sufficient for at least the next 12 months.
For these reasons the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Auditors
A resolution to reappoint Deloitte and T ouche LLP as auditors will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Approved by the Board of Directors on 17 May 2005 and signed on behalf of the Board Lucy OBrien Secretary LiDCO Group plc Annual Report January 2005 20 Independent Auditors report to the members of LiDCO Group plc We have audited the financial statements of LiDCO Group Plc for the 13 months ended 31 January 2005 which comprise the consolidated profit and loss account the balance sheets consolidated cash flow statement the reconciliation of movement in consolidated equity shareholders funds the consolidated statement of total recognised gains and losses and related notes 1 to 23.
These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
This report is made solely to the Companys members as a body in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Companys members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors report and for no other purpose.
T o the fullest extent permitted by law we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Companys members as a body for our audit report for this report or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors As described in the statement of Directors responsibilities the Companys Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant United Kingdom legal and regulatory requirements and auditing standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
We also report if in our opinion the Directors report is not consistent with the financial statements if the Company has not kept proper accounting records if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit or if information specified by law regarding Directors remuneration and transactions with the Company and other members of the Group is not disclosed.
We read the Directors report for the above year and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies in the financial statements.
Basis of audit opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination on a test basis of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Companys and the Groups circumstances consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error .
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Going concern As set out in note 1 to the financial statements the Company has continued to record operating losses as a result of continuing to invest in the development of its operations and may require additional funding in the event that new sales are not achieved as forecast by the Directors.
If necessary the Directors believe that there are sufficient opportunities available to them to obtain additional funding from sources which are currently being explored.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might arise from the new sales required by the forecasts not being achieved or if necessary a failure to obtain new funding.
In view of the significance of this uncertainty we draw attention to this matter but our opinion is not qualified in this respect.
Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group at 31 January 2005 and of the loss of the Group for the 13 months then ended and have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

The particular accounting policies adopted are described below.
Advantage has been taken of the exemption under s230 of the Companies Act 1985 not to disclose the profit and loss account of the Company.
The loss of the Company for the year is shown in note 22.
Accounting convention The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention.
There have been no changes in the Groups accounting policies from those used in the 2003 statutory accounts with the exception of the implementation of UITF 38 as described in note 2.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated accounts incorporate the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries.
Going concern The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis which assumes that the Company will have sufficient funds to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The Company has continued to invest in the development of its operations and as a result has continued to trade at a loss in the thirteen months ended 31 January 2005.
The Directors have approved forecasts until the end of May 2006 which indicate that the Company will have sufficient funding to continue to trade during that period.
The forecasts assume a level of new sales about which there is uncertainty.
If such new sales are not achieved the Directors believe that there are sufficient opportunities available to them to obtain additional funding from sources which are currently being explored to enable the Company to continue to develop its operations and to meet its liabilities as they fall due.
Accordingly the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments that would be required in the event that the Company had insufficient funding available.
Merger accounting Admission to the AIM Market of the London Stock Exchange occurred on 5 July 2001.
The restructuring of the Group agreed by the shareholders in February 2001 under which the minority holdings in LiDCO Limited would be bought out in exchange for shares in LiDCO Group was conditional upon admission and is therefore deemed to have occurred on 5 July 2001.
The Directors consider that the relative rights of the shareholders have in substance remained unchanged during the reorganisation.
Merger accounting has therefore been adopted as the accounting treatment for the reorganisation.
Under this method results are reported as if the acquiring companies have been combined since incorporation.
No purchased goodwill is created in the transaction and the assets and liabilities of LiDCO Limited are not adjusted to reflect their market value.

Foreign exchange Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.

These translation differences are dealt with in the profit and loss account.
Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is provided in full on timing differences arising from the different treatment of items for accounting and taxation purposes which are expected to reverse in the future without replacement calculated at the rates at which it is expected that tax will arise.
Deferred taxation is not discounted.
