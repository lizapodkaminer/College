Both of our prime central London estates had a very active year in which management made good operational progress.
The Covent Garden estate which now represents more than 70 per cent of the Groups portfolio by value delivered positive performance and value growth.
The value of our investments at Earls Court has however been impacted by challenges in the London residential market.
PERFORMANCE
Capcos total shareholder return for the year which comprises share price performance plus the dividends paid during the year was 8.1 per cent and total return for the year which represents the change in net assets plus the dividends paid during the year was 1.3 per cent.
The total value of Capcos property portfolio fell by 0.9 per cent on a likeforlike basis to 3.5 billion with gains at Covent Garden being offset by a reduction in the Earls Court valuation.
Covent Garden is established as a renowned retail and dining destination and continues to attract target brands.
The Covent Garden estate is benefiting from a period of significant investment made over recent years creating an inviting environment with a wide variety of British heritage independent and global brands offering a broad selection of retail and dining experiences across the estate.
Net rental income has increased significantly in 2017.
Capcos distinct approach to creative asset management continues to drive leasing activity and in turn ERV progression.
Initiatives to enhance the estate have been very successful.
Examples include the establishment of Henrietta Street as a menswear and dining destination and the successful repositioning Capco Annual Report and Accounts 2017 8 of the Royal Opera House Arcade.
In addition a number of acquisitions have extended our presence on Floral Street.
The
Floral Court development is nearing completion with the courtyard and restaurant openings expected over the coming months.
Economic and political uncertainty has impacted the residential market in London resulting in a further decline in the valuation of our investments at Earls Court.
The consented Masterplan remains one of the largest Opportunity Areas in central London with the ability to evolve with the needs of the Capital.
The political and economic environment has made discussions on enhancing the Masterplan more difficult however Capco will continue to seek to positively engage with all stakeholders to evolve the Masterplan over time.
At Earls Court Partnership Limited ECPL our investment vehicle with Transport for London TfL the final phase of the complex demolition of the former Earls Court Exhibition Centres has been successfully completed in preparation for future development.
Handover of the first phase of the Lillie Square residential development nears completion and half of Phase 2 has been presold at a modest premium to comparable units in Phase 1.
In April 2017 Capco completed the sale of the Venues business at a slight premium to net asset value in keeping with our established strategy of recycling capital through the disposal of noncore assets.
FINANCIAL POSITION AND DIVIDENDS Capco continues to maintain a strong balance sheet with low leverage high liquidity and modest capital commitments.
During the year Capco extended its debt maturities further diversified its sources of funding with a Private Placement and successfully executed the sale of Venues.
The business is wellpositioned to support its future activities and take advantage of opportunities as they arise.
The Directors are proposing a final dividend of 1.0 pence per share which brings the total dividend for 2017 to 1.5 pence per share.
PEOPLE
The Company has evolved during the year and the Board and I would like to thank our employees for their work and commitment.
There were a number of changes to the Board in 2017.
At the beginning of the year Situl Jobanputra was promoted to Chief Financial Officer following Soumen Das departure at the end of 2016.
Charlotte Boyle was appointed as a Nonexecutive Director and member of the Nomination and Remuneration Committees in October 2017 following Demetra Pinsents decision to step down from the Board in July 2017.
I am pleased to report that Situl and Charlotte have both settled into their new roles well and I was delighted to see the recognition of internal talent.
Demetras departure unfortunately sets back our gender diversity aspirations at Board level.
The Board will consider this along with wider diversity for any future appointments and is committed to encouraging diversity inclusiveness and the development of our people across the business.
SHAREHOLDERS
Capco is listed on the London Stock Exchange and the JSE and over 50 per cent of the Companys shares are held by South African investors.
There are sometimes different market expectations in the UK and South Africa and one example of this is the level of authority to issue new shares that shareholders expect to grant to
The Board feels that to preserve flexibility it is appropriate to seek the conventional level of authorities expected by shareholders in UK listed companies where possible.
This has resulted in significant votes against two of our AGM resolutions and Capcos inclusion in The Investment Associations public register of shareholder dissent.
The Board will maintain dialogue with our South African shareholders on this topic.
BOARD OVERSIGHT Nonexecutive Directors are encouraged to visit our assets in Covent Garden and Earls Court and meet operational management regularly.
This is achieved through individual visits and Board update meetings sometimes held on site and helps the Board keep abreast of the business challenges and opportunities and to contribute to strategic debate.
This has been a year of considerable change in the macroeconomic and political context in which Capco operates and I am grateful for the Directors diligence and engagement throughout the year.
In reaching its conclusions regarding key business decisions the Board takes account of the different stakeholders relevant to Capco and its activities including local communities where we operate partners lenders government and our own people as well as shareholders.
The Board also regularly reviews the changing risks affecting Capco and takes account of changes to risks when discussing strategy and reviewing operations.
Health and Safety receives particular attention at Board meetings and across the business.
LOOKING AHEAD London is an outstanding global city and remains a very attractive investment arena.
Our strategy remains clear and focused on delivering longterm value for shareholders from our two prime central London estates.
The Board remains alert to broader economic and political uncertainty and its potential impact on market conditions however Capcos strong financial position enables the Group to support its future activities and provides the financial flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they arise.

20 February 2018 site 9 Governance Financial statements Strategic report Chief Executives review A year of good operational progress Capco has made good operational progress across its two prime central London estates.
Covent Garden which now accounts for 72 per cent of the Groups portfolio by value has had another strong year creating value and positive rental performance.
We continue to implement our strategy by focusing on asset management investment and managing the estate creatively.
Covent Garden is a worldclass destination in the heart of central London offering a vibrant mix of British heritage independent and global brands and continues to evolve to meet consumer demand.
Investments made in recent years including on Henrietta Street Floral Street King Street and the Royal Opera House Arcade have positioned the estate well.
This has resulted in strong demand from occupiers and as new concepts open we are capturing the reversionary income potential of the portfolio.
At Earls Court good operational progress has been made.
ECPL the investment vehicle with TfL which represents our principal investment in Earls Court successfully completed the final phase of the complex demolition of the former Exhibition Centres which prepares the land for development.
At Lillie Square Phase 1 handover has substantially completed.
By the end of 2017 the residents of 182 new homes had been welcomed to the scheme.
A popup high street for Earls Court was successfully launched on Lillie Road.
Whilst the West End and Covent Garden have continued to thrive economic and political uncertainty has continued to impact the residential market in London resulting in a further valuation decline in our investments at Earls Court.
The growth in Covent Garden was offset by a decline in the value at Earls Court.
As a result EPRA net asset value fell by 1.7 per cent over the year to 334 pence.
While the environment for largescale residential development has become more difficult the Earls Court Masterplan has an existing planning consent in place and remains one of the largest Opportunity Areas in central London capable of delivering new homes jobs and investment.
Earls Court has the ability to evolve with the needs of London and its potential will be realised over time.
As a longterm investor in London Capco will continue to seek to engage positively with our partners and all stakeholders in order to evolve the Masterplan which has the flexibility to be brought forward through the introduction of thirdparty capital and selective development.
Over the year the Group successfully realised value from the sale of its Venues business crystallising 230 million of net proceeds which will be recycled into Capcos central London estates.
Capcos prudent approach to its balance sheet continues.
We maintain a strong financial position with low leverage high liquidity and modest capital commitments.
The business is wellpositioned to support its future activities navigate market uncertainties while taking advantage of opportunities as they arise.
Capco remains disciplined in its investment approach with a weighting towards Covent Garden as we continue to expand our ownership on the estate.
CLEAR AND FOCUSED STRATEGY TO DRIVE LONGTERM VALUE CREATION Ian Hawksworth Chief Executive Capco Annual Report and Accounts 2017 10
The total property value of the Group declined 0.9 per cent likeforlike in the year to 31 December 2017 to 3.5 billion.
The valuation of Covent Garden has risen by 4.3 per cent likeforlike to 2.5 billion driven by ERV growth of 4.6 per cent achieved over the year.
The equivalent yield remains broadly unchanged reflecting the valuers current view of the strength of demand for prime central London real estate.
Capcos investment in Earls Court Properties declined by 11.8 per cent likeforlike to 1.0 billion at 31 December 2017.
A number of adjustments have been made to the component parts of the valuation of our interest in ECPL.
The valuers more conservative view on gross development value and the cost of delivery together with recent transactional evidence in the land market have resulted in a net decline of 14.4 per cent likeforlike for ECPL in the second half of the year.
Similarly the valuation of our other interests at Earls Court has declined reflecting changes in valuation assumptions.
The Group has a 63 per cent controlling interest in ECPL the investment vehicle with TfL which owns the land formerly occupied by the Earls Court Exhibition Centres EC1 and EC2.
As a result it is fully consolidated in the financial statements and TfLs interest is represented as a noncontrolling interest.

Our creative asset management strategy has driven positive leasing momentum with good demand for all uses across the estate.
We continue to strengthen the core categories of luxury gifting and accessories cosmetics and differentiated dining concepts.
The estate is valued at 2.5 billion as at 31 December 2017 a likeforlike increase of 4.3 per cent.
During the year 21 new retail and restaurant brands were signed to the estate the most in any year to date.
As a result of positive demand across all uses 90 new lettings and renewals were agreed securing 14.6 million of rental income at 10.4 per cent above December 2016 ERV.
Net rental income has increased significantly by 17.8 per cent in absolute terms or 11.3 per cent likeforlike for the year.
The ERV of the estate is 105 million up 4.6 per cent on a likeforlike basis with positive progress being made towards the ERV target of 125 million by December 2020.
The range of dining concepts on the estate continues to expand with the introduction of a number of high quality and differentiated concepts including The Oystermen Avobar and The Henrietta.
The latest additions further enhance Covent Gardens attractiveness as one of Londons most desirable dining destinations.
Covent Gardens retail offering has gone from strength to strength.
The Market Building has introduced Daniel Wellington Tom Ford and Deciem.
The repositioning of the Royal Opera House Arcade continues with the addition of leading travel brand Tumi which is set to join British heritage brands N.
Peal and Tom Davies which opened stores during the year.
Lettings to Kent and Curwen and The Shop at Bluebird represent an excellent start to the repositioning of Floral Street.
Development of Floral Court nears completion.
Anchored by Petersham Nurseries the courtyard is expected to open in the coming months and will improve the circulation of pedestrian flows on the northern part of the estate.
The residential component comprising 45 new apartments is expected to complete by summer 2018.
We have continued to invest in the estate through acquisitions which offer value creation opportunities.
99 million was invested in acquisitions during the year most notably consolidating our presence on Floral Street.
Earls Court Properties  largescale strategic opportunity in central London During the year ECPL successfully completed the final phase of the complex demolition of the former Earls Court Exhibition Centres in preparation for future development.
Handover of Phase 1 of Lillie Square nears completion with 98 million Capco share of proceeds received by the end of the year.
Cumulative proceeds of 125 million Capco share are expected to have been received on Phase 1 over the coming months.
Negotiations are at an advanced stage for the main construction contract for Phase 2.
50 per cent of the 186 apartments in the phase have now been reserved or exchanged.
34 of these transacted during 2017 seven of which occurred during the second half of the year.
Sales prices achieved in Phase 2 are at a modest premium to comparable units in Phase 1.
The consented Earls Court Masterplan is a strategic development for London and is identified as a Greater London Authority GLA Opportunity Area.
It is referenced in the draft London Plan issued in December 2017 as ready to grow.
The political environment has made discussions on enhancing the Masterplan more difficult however Capco will continue to seek to engage positively with the GLA our partners at Transport for London and other stakeholders to evolve the Masterplan over time.
This includes discussions with London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham LBHF regarding the possibility of the Council taking the lead on future plans for the West Kensington and Gibbs Green Estates The Estates.
Chief Executives review continued Site progress at Earls Court Capco Annual Report and Accounts 2017 12 Ian Hawksworth Chief Executive 20 February 2018 Capco is in discussions with MOPAC the Mayors Office for Policing and Crime regarding its ongoing occupational requirements at the Empress State Building which may include a lease extension or sale of the building.
There is no certainty that any transaction will be agreed.
Innova Investment In 2015 Capco acquired a 50 per cent interest in Innova Investment formerly Solum Developments a joint venture with Network Rail which is exploring potential opportunities for future redevelopments at significant railway station sites across London.
Sale of Venues On 7 April 2017 Capco completed the sale of Venues to a consortium of German institutional investors for 296 million.
Profit on disposal of Venues was 2 million.
Having extracted significant value from the venue since acquisition Capco took the decision to exit this noncore asset realising value for shareholders through sale.
Cash proceeds were used initially to repay bank debt and will be deployed in Capcos prime central London estates over time.
Outlook
Covent Garden is a worldclass retail and dining destination in the heart of London offering a differentiated mix of global British heritage and independent brands addressing the needs of the consumer.
Through creative asset management and by attracting excellent retail brands and dining concepts the reversionary income potential of the portfolio will be captured.
Capco will continue to invest in strategic acquisitions interventions and in enhancing the customer environment.
Following a year of positive leasing activity 2018 will be another active year for openings across the estate which are expected to further strengthen Covent Gardens reputation as a leading global destination.
The estate remains wellplaced for continued success and ERV progression towards the target of 125 million by December 2020.
The consented Earls Court Masterplan represents one of the most important mixeduse developments in London.
The GLAs draft London Plan issued in December 2017 references Earls Court as ready to grow demonstrating the sites potential to deliver more housing and optimise this important London scheme.
Whilst the economic and political environment presents challenges to the London residential market and large scale developments Capco will continue to seek to positively engage with all of its partners and stakeholders to evolve the Masterplan.
The consented Masterplan has the flexibility to be brought forward through the introduction of thirdparty capital and selective development.
Capco has a clear strategy to deliver longterm value creation for our shareholders from our two prime central London estates.
Backed by a strong balance sheet with low leverage high liquidity and modest capital commitments Capco is wellpositioned to support its future activities navigate market uncertainties and take advantage of opportunities as they arise.

Capco Annual Report and Accounts 2017 14 Key performance indicators
PERFORMANCE
The Groups key performance indicators are selected to ensure clear alignment between its strategy shareholder interests and remuneration of its employees.
Based on consensus estimates at 16 February 2018 for comparator group where results are unavailable.
The threeyear total property return is calculated assuming annual reinvestment.
Annualised threeyear total return and total shareholder return are calculated on a basis consistent with the Groups longterm incentive plans.
A number of other indicators of performance are considered by the Board either at a Group level including underlying earnings per share or specifically relevant to each estate for example ERV at Covent Garden.
These are discussed further in the assetspecific operating reviews in the Strategic Report.
All three key performance indicators are directly linked to Executive Directors remuneration.
These three indicators are carefully aligned with the Groups strategy of creating and growing value and delivering marketleading total returns over the longer term.
Total property return underlying earnings per share and net asset value are linked to annual bonuses available to certain of the Groups employees.
Total property return is calculated as capital growth including gains and losses on disposal plus rents received less associated costs including ground rent.
This metric allows comparability with the IPD Total Return All Property Index.
Total return is the growth in EPRA NAV per share plus dividends per share during the year.
Outperformance over a threeyear period versus the median of a comparator group of the nine largest constituents of the FTSE 350 Real Estate Index is identified as a key measure of the success of Capcos strategy.
Total shareholder return is the increase in the price of an ordinary share plus dividends during the year.
The Groups total shareholder return is benchmarked against the median total shareholder return of a comparator group of the nine largest constituents of the FTSE 350 Real Estate Index.
As a key metric for the longterm equity based compensation for the Groups employees total shareholder return aligns incentives with shareholder interest.

Risk management
The Board has overall responsibility for Group risk management.
It determines its risk appetite and reviews principal risks and uncertainties regularly together with the actions taken to mitigate them.
The
Board has delegated responsibility for the review of the adequacy and effectiveness of the Groups internal control framework to the Audit Committee.
Following a comprehensive review of risk management undertaken in 2015 risk is a standing agenda item at all management meetings.
This gives rise to a more risk aware culture and consistency in decision making across the organisation in line with the corporate strategy and risk appetite.
All corporate decision making takes risk into account in a measured way while continuing to drive an entrepreneurial culture.
The Executive Directors are responsible for the daytoday operational and commercial activity across the Group and are therefore responsible for the management of business risk.
The Executive Risk Committee comprising the Executive Directors the General Counsel and Director of Corporate Services and the Financial Controller is the executive level management forum for the review and discussion of risks controls and mitigation measures.
The corporate and business division risks are reviewed on a quarterly basis by the Executive Risk Committee so that trends and emerging risks can be identified and reported to the Board.
Senior management from every division and corporate function of the business identify and manage the risks for their division or function and complete and maintain a risk register.
The severity of each risk is assessed through a combination of each risks likelihood of an adverse outcome and its impact.
In assessing impact consideration is given to financial reputational and regulatory factors and risk mitigation plans are established.
A full risk review is undertaken annually in which the risk registers are aggregated and reviewed by the Executive Risk Committee.

GROUP STRATEGY All of the principal risks and uncertainties have been mapped to the most relevant strategic priority These principal risks are not exhaustive.
The Group monitors a number of additional risks and adjusts those considered principal as the risk profile of the business changes.
See also the risks inherent in the compilation of financial information as disclosed within note 1 Principal Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation and uncertainty.
Since the EU Referendum there has been economic and political uncertainty and this is expected to continue into the foreseeable future.
To date there has been no adverse impact on occupier demand for the Covent Garden estate which has seen strong rental growth although the valuation of residentialled development land has been impacted by the overall economic and political backdrop.
The political framework for large scale residential development has become more difficult.
In the Autumn Statement the government announced it will introduce planning reform that will aim for more land to become available for housing.

The Directors have determined that the threeyear period to December 2020 is an appropriate period over which to provide its viability statement as it is the period covered by the latest business plan which takes into account the Groups current position individual asset performance forecasts and the potential impact of the principal risks disclosed on pages 1719.

The business plan considers the Groups cash flow capital commitments financial resources debt covenants and other key financial risks.
All of the Groups risks could have an impact on viability.
The Directors consider the key principal risks that could impact the viability of the Group to be economic conditions funding and leasing.
A sensitivity analysis was carried out which involved flexing a number of the main assumptions to consider alterative macroeconomic conditions both positive and negative.
In particular the Group considered an economic downturn scenario with conditions equivalent to that of the 20072009 financial crisis leading to asset value and rental income decline as well as rising interest rates.
Additional scenarios were reviewed including stress testing the Groups financing covenants and increasing the Groups exposure to development activity.
This analysis was carried out to evaluate the potential impact of the Groups principal risks actually occurring and based on the results the Directors believe that the Group is wellplaced to manage its principal risks successfully.
This assessment has considered the potential impacts of these risks on the business model future performance solvency and liquidity over the period.
Based on this assessment the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and Company will be able to continue in operation and meet their liabilities as they fall due over the period to December 2020.
In making this statement the Directors have considered the resilience of the Group taking account of its current position the risk appetite the principal risks facing the business in severe but reasonable scenarios and the effectiveness of any mitigating actions.

Largescale strategic opportunity in central London The Earls Court and West Kensington Opportunity Area represents one of the most important mixeduse development sites in London with the potential to create a new district delivering thousands of homes and jobs.
The Earls Court Masterplan is a strategic opportunity for London with planning consent for 10.7 million square feet including the Empress State Building.
The consented Masterplan provides for 7500 new homes and is anticipated to create 10000 jobs and deliver over 450 million of community benefits.
The site is located within two London Boroughs the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea RBKC and the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham LBHF is supported by excellent transport infrastructure and has the potential to deliver substantially more housing.
Investments at Earls Court Earls Court Properties represents Capcos investments within the Earls Court and West Kensington Opportunity Area and principally comprises 63 per cent interest in ECPL the investment vehicle with TfL in respect of EC1 and EC2 and including certain assets on and around Lillie Road.
Capcos interests in ECPL were valued at 560.7 million at 31 December 2017.
ECPL land has detailed planning consent for 3.4 million square feet GEA and following successful completion of the final phase of complex demolition works is available for development.
100 per cent of the Empress State Building ESB valued at 220.0 million at 31 December 2017.
ESB has detailed planning consent to be converted from an office building into residential.
ESB is let to MOPAC until June 2019 with a current passing rent of 17.0 million.
50 per cent interest in the Lillie Square joint venture with Capcos 50 per cent interest valued at 156.5 million at 31 December 2017.
Handover of Lillie Square Phase 1 is substantially complete and Phase 2 continues to progress.
In addition in 2013 Capco exercised its option under the Conditional Land Sale Agreement CLSA a binding agreement in relation to the West Kensington and Gibbs Green Estates the Estates.
To date Capco has paid 75 million of the 105 million cash consideration payable to LBHF including three of the five annual instalments of 15 million.
Demolition works ECPL the investment vehicle with TfL owns 999 year leases over the EC1 and EC2 land together with certain adjacent properties primarily located on or around Lillie Road.
Capco owns a 63 per cent share and is leading the venture in its role as business and development manager.
The final phase of demolition of the former Earls Court Exhibition Centres successfully completed on schedule in January 2018.
The heavy lifting crane was the most visible part of the important site preparation.
The crane successfully completed the lift of 61 concrete portal beams out from over the London Underground lines.
Removal of the large portal beams which supported the weight of the former Earls Court Exhibition Centres concludes the complex demolition works in preparation for future development which has the flexibility to be brought forward through the introduction of thirdparty capital over time.

In January 2017 detailed planning consent was granted by RBKC for Exhibition Square which is located at the entrance of the Earls Court estate adjacent to Earls Court Underground station.
The consented scheme will create an important gateway to Earls Court and its new high street including a public square and gardens a signature hotel offices and an entrance to Earls Court Underground station.
The Earls Court Masterplan remains one of the largest Opportunity Areas in central London capable of delivering new homes jobs and investment.
Additional density could deliver muchneeded homes for all Londoners including additional affordable housing and a broad range of residential tenures.
The GLAs draft London Plan issued in December 2017 The Plan references the Earls Court Masterplan as ready to grow demonstrating the sites potential to deliver more housing and optimise this important London opportunity.
In addition The Plan estimates that the population of London will increase by 70000 per annum reaching 10.5 million in 2041.
According to The Plan London will need at least 66000 new homes annually.
Opportunity Areas such as Earls Court are seen as vital in order to meet Londons demands.
Capco notes with disappointment the statement released by LBHF regarding the deliverability of the proposed level of density and affordable housing however remains in discussions with LBHF including regarding the possibility of the Council taking the lead on future plans for the Estates as part of the wider Masterplan.
In the event that agreement is not reached with LBHF the CLSA a binding agreement in relation to the Estates will remain in place.
Capco will continue to seek to engage positively with all stakeholders in order to evolve the Masterplan to address the changing political landscape and prevailing market conditions.
Due to the scale of the Earls Court Masterplan there will remain a risk of protests and legal challenges ranging from complaints about noise through to judicial reviews or applications for listing against specific aspects of the development as it is progressed.
It should be noted that all such challenges to date have been successfully defended however future challenges of this nature cannot be discounted.
West Brompton Crossing temporary retail and leisure use In November 2017 ECPL successfully launched a popup local high street for Earls Court named West Brompton Crossing with anchor tenant The Prince.
The Prince is located on the junction of Lillie Road and Empress Place within a number of buildings brought back into temporary use and features eateries including Patty and Bun The Begging Bowl MAM and Rabbit.
The project marks a first for temporary retail and leisure use in the area offering a parade of restaurants bars and shops that have proved a very popular addition to the area.

The Masterplan has the flexibility to be brought forward through the introduction of thirdparty capital and selective development.
At the Empress State Building discussions continue with the tenant regarding its occupational requirements and at Lillie Square the focus is on delivery of the remaining homes of Phase 1 ensuring a successful handover to all residents.
On Phase 2 the focus remains on continued sales and completion of negotiations on the main construction contract which is expected over the coming months.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
Our capital structure positions the Group to withstand prevailing market conditions take advantage of opportunities as they arise and deliver longterm returns to shareholders by driving value creation across our assets.
Situl Jobanputra Chief Financial Officer
FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
EPRA NAV of 334 pence per share a 1.7% decrease Total return of 1.3% Total property value of 3.5 billion LTV of 21% Cash and undrawn facilities 691 million Group share Capco further strengthened its financial position during 2017 reducing loan to value to 21 per cent and increasing available liquidity to 691 million.
This has been achieved by the realisation of value through the disposal of the Venues business and further enhancing the unsecured debt platform at Covent Garden by raising a further 225 million in the private placement market and extending the 705 million revolving credit facility to 2022.
There was additional investment in Covent Garden of 177 million through developments predominantly Floral Court and 99 million of acquisitions which have served to increase the Groups weighting in Covent Garden to 72 per cent.
The value of the Covent Garden estate increased by 4.3 per cent likeforlike due to the rental growth achieved during the year with ERV up by 4.6 per cent on a likeforlike basis.
Uncertainties in the broader political and economic environment continue to impact London residential property.
As a result the market value of Earls Court Properties which represents the Groups interests at Earls Court has decreased by 11.8 per cent likeforlike.
Overall the Group share of the total property value has decreased by 0.9 per cent likeforlike.
EPRA net asset value per share decreased by 1.7 per cent during the year from 339.6 pence at 31 December 2016 to 333.8 pence.
This 5.8 pence decline together with the 1.5 pence dividend paid to shareholders resulted in a total return of 1.3 per cent.
Underlying earnings from continuing activities increased to 7.3 million due to higher net rental income and reduced administration expenses.
Basis of preparation In line with the requirements of IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements the Group is required to present its joint ventures under the equity method in the consolidated financial statements.
Under the equity method the Groups interest in joint ventures is disclosed as a single line item in both the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated income statement rather than proportionally consolidating the Groups share of assets liabilities income and expenses on a linebyline basis.
Alternative Performance Measures APMs being financial measures which are not specified under IFRS are used by the Group to monitor the performance of the business.
These include a number of the Financial Highlights shown on page 3.
Many of the APMs included are based on the EPRA Best Practice Recommendations reporting framework which aims to improve the transparency comparability and relevance of published results of public real estate companies in Europe.
Further details on APMs are set out on page 141.

Therefore to align with the way the Group is managed this financial review presents the financial position performance and cash flow analysis on a Group share basis.
Discontinued operation On 7 April 2017 the Venues business was sold.
As Venues has previously represented a separate major line of business its results and cash flows have been reported for the period 1 January 2017 to 7 April 2017 as having arisen from a discontinued operation.
This extends to the prior period comparative which has been represented to reflect the disposal.
Further information on the disposal of the Venues business is set out in note 12 Discontinued Operation.
The chart below sets out a summary of the main movements in the EPRA net asset value per share over the year.
Governance Financial statements Strategic report Financial review continued Investment development and trading property The revaluation loss on the Groups property portfolio was 37.6 million for the year representing a 0.9 per cent decrease in value on a likeforlike basis compared with the IPD Capital Return for the equivalent period of 5.4 per cent.
The Group revaluation loss consists of a 93.4 million gain at Covent Garden and a 131.0 million loss at Earls Court.
Total property return for the year was 1.0 per cent.
The IPD Total Return index recorded a 11.2 per cent return for the corresponding period.
The total revaluation loss of 37.6 million consists of a 27.9 million loss on investment property and a 9.7 million loss on trading property.
On an IFRS basis which includes ECPL at 100 per cent and does not include Lillie Square on a line by line basis loss on revaluation and sale of investment and development property was 90.9 million.
Trading property is carried on the consolidated balance sheet at the lower of cost and market value therefore valuation surpluses on trading property are not recorded.
Any unrecognised surplus is however reflected within the EPRA net asset value measure.
During the year 6.6 million of the unrealised trading property surplus has been realised.
At 31 December 2017 the unrecognised surplus on trading property was 31.8 million 31 December 2016 48.1 million which now arises solely on the Groups share of trading property at Lillie Square.
Debt and gearing During the year the Groups share of total facilities increased by 24.5 million.
During the first half of the year the Group terminated the 100 million Olympia Exhibitions Holdings Limited facility of which 50 million was drawn prior to termination the 85.5 million loan on the Empress State Building and 30 million 15 million Group share of the Lillie Square LP facility.
In June the Group signed an agreement with eight institutional investors for a private placement of 225 million with a range of maturities from 7 to 20 year senior unsecured notes further enhancing the unsecured debt platform at Covent Garden.
Closing occurred in August 2017 and proceeds were used to repay bank debt.
In November 2017 the Group exercised the option under the 705 million Covent Garden debt facility to extend the full loan amount to 2022.
The Groups cash and undrawn committed facilities at 31 December 2017 were 690.8 million 31 December 2016 556.3 million.

Noncontrolling interest represents TfLs 37 per cent share of ECPL.
Net debt decreased by 114 million to 734 million principally as a result of the disposal of the Venues business partly offset by further investment into our assets and the acquisitions at Covent Garden.
As set out in the summary adjusted balance sheet net debt on an IFRS basis was 748 million.
The gearing measure most widely used in the industry is loan to value LTV.
LTV is calculated on the basis of net debt divided by the carrying value of the Groups property portfolio.
The Group focuses most on an LTV measure that includes the notional share of joint venture interests but excludes the share of the noncontrolling interest.
The LTV of 21.3 per cent remains comfortably within the Groups limit of no more than 40 per cent.
2017 2016 Loan to value 21.3% 23.4% Interest cover 170% 173% Weighted average debt maturity 6.9 years 5.9 years Weighted average cost of debt 2.8% 2.7% Gross debt with interest rate protection 91% 86% The Groups policy is to eliminate substantially the medium and longterm risk arising from interest rate volatility.
The Groups banking facilities are arranged on a floating rate basis but are generally swapped to fixed rate or capped using derivative contracts.
At 31 December 2017 the proportion of gross debt with interest rate protection was 91 per cent 31 December 2016 86 per cent.
The Group remains compliant with all of its debt covenants details of which are set out on page 140 and has substantial levels of headroom against its covenants across all of its debt facilities.
Capco Annual Report and Accounts 2017 40 At 31 December 2017 the Group had capital commitments of 61.3 million 156.6 million at 31 December 2016 of which Covent Garden represents 19.5 million and Earls Court Properties 41.8 million including the 30.0 million of CLSA instalments and 7.0 million in relation to Lillie Square.

Conditional Land Sale Agreement CLSA In November 2013 the Group exercised its option under the CLSA which it entered into with LBHF for the purchase of the West Kensington and Gibbs Green housing estates the Estates.
The overall consideration payable is expected to be 105 million cash plus the planning requirement to provide up to 760 replacement homes.
The CLSA remains unrecognised in the consolidated financial statements of the Group as its main underlying asset the land relating to the Estates does not currently meet the recognition criteria under IFRS required for investment and development property.
Annual payments of 15 million commenced in December 2015 and will run through to December 2019.
Where amounts are paid prior to the transfer of property they will be carried on the Groups balance sheet as prepayments against future land draw down.
Of the 75 million paid to date 15 million relates to the acquisition of two properties held as investment and development property and 60 million relates to options over the Estates which is held as a prepayment within other receivables.
The remaining future payments totalling 30 million are disclosed as a capital commitment as referred to above.
The prepayment balance will be transferred to investment and development property once the recognition criteria of investment and development property have been met.
Once this occurs in line with the Groups accounting policy the land will become subject to biannual valuation with any changes reflected in the Groups reported net asset measure.

Net cash flow is based on unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and therefore does not include the movement in Lillie Square deposits on a Group share basis of 3.7 million.
Governance Financial statements Strategic report Financial review continued Operating cash outflows of 24.0 million of which 15.0 million relates to the CLSA annual payment have decreased from 42.4 million for the year to 31 December 2016 as a result of changes in net working capital requirements.
During the year 170.2 million was invested at Covent Garden for the purchase of three properties and subsequent expenditure for the development of property predominantly at Floral Court.
At Earls Court total expenditure of 55.4 million comprises enablement works on ECPL land construction of Lillie Square Phase 1 the acquisition of two properties and other subsequent expenditure.
The disposal of the Venues business resulted in a net inflow of 226 million after repayment of the 50 million drawn debt on the 100 million Olympia Exhibitions Holdings Limited loan facility working capital adjustments and transaction related costs.
The proceeds were used to reduce the Groups net debt position and will be deployed in Capcos core central London estates.
Net sales proceeds from trading property comprise of 95.9 million Group share for the disposal of 177 units at Lillie Square 92.0 million and for the sale of the final two residential units at The Beecham Covent Garden 3.9 million.
Disposal of investment property net of payments in relation to investments resulted in proceeds of 8.7 million being received during the year.
Net borrowings repaid during the period were 75.7 million.
Dividends paid of 6.7 million reflect the final dividend payment made in respect of the 2016 financial year and the interim dividend paid in September 2017.
This was lower than the previous year due to a higher take up of the scrip dividend alternative 47 per cent versus 41 per cent in 2016.

Income
Net rental income has increased by 8.3 million 14.4 per cent during the year mainly as a result of the positive performance at Covent Garden up 11.3 per cent likeforlike.
Of the increase 5.4 million has been achieved on the likeforlike portfolio as the Group continues to convert the reversionary potential into contracted rents.
A further 2.9 million has been added through prior and current year acquisitions with the remaining increase resulting from the net effect of disposals and properties classified as development.
At Covent Garden gross income has increased by 15.4 per cent from 52.1 million in 2016 to 60.1 million whilst ERV has increased by 9.2 per cent from 96.0 million in 2016 to 104.8 million.
Loss on revaluation and sale of investment and development property The loss on revaluation and sale of the Groups investment and development property was 28.0 million.
Covent Garden recorded a gain on revaluation of 93.4 million as a result of rental growth.
The loss on revaluation at Earls Court of 121.4 million was driven by changes in valuers assumptions and is reflective of recent evidence.
Administration expenses Administration expenses have decreased by 3.2 million on a headline basis.
The prior year included a 2.0 million credit for performance related employment costs and an assumed allocation of 4.0 million of head office costs to the Venues business.
Allowing for these items likeforlike administration expenses of 38.7 million compared with 47.9 million in 2016 a decrease of 19.2 per cent.
Net finance costs Net finance costs have increased marginally to 19.8 million due to the higher level of average borrowings during the year.
Governance Financial statements Strategic report Financial review continued
The total tax charge for the year made up of both underlying tax and nonunderlying tax is 6.7 million.
Tax on underlying profits of the Group was 2.7 million which reflects a rate in line with the current rate of UK corporation tax.
The main rate of corporation tax reduced from 20 per cent to 19 per cent from 1 April 2017.
The corporation tax rate will further reduce to 17 per cent from 1 April 2020.
Contingent tax the amount of tax that would become payable on a theoretical disposal of all investment property held by the Group was nil 31 December 2016 nil.
A disposal of the Groups trading properties at their market value net of available losses would result in a corporation tax charge to the Group of 1.6 million 19.25 per cent of 8.3 million.
The provisions of IAS 12 provide for the recognition of a deferred tax asset where it is probable there will be future taxable profit against which a deductible temporary difference can be utilised.
As a result of the application of this provision the Group has not recognised the deferred tax asset on decreases to the carrying value of investment property and certain losses carried forward.
The Groups tax policy which has been approved by the Board and is available on the Group website is aligned with the business strategy.
The Group seeks to protect shareholder value by structuring operations in a tax efficient manner with external advice as appropriate which complies with all relevant tax law and regulations and does not adversely impact our reputation as a responsible taxpayer.
As a Group we are committed to acting in an open and transparent manner.
Consistent with the Groups policy of complying with relevant tax legislation and its goal in respect of its stakeholders the Group maintains a constructive and open working relationship with HM Revenue and Customs which regularly includes obtaining advance clearance on key transactions where the tax treatment may be uncertain.
Dividends
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 1.0 pence per share to be paid on 23 May 2018 to shareholders on the register at 20 April 2018.
Subject to SARB approval the Board intends to offer a scrip dividend alternative.
Going concern At 31 December 2017 the Groups cash and undrawn committed facilities were 690.8 million and its capital commitments were 61.3 million.
With a weighted average debt maturity of 6.9 years loan to value of 21.3 per cent and sufficient headroom against all financial covenants there continues to be a reasonable expectation that the Company and Group will have adequate resources to meet both ongoing and future commitments for at least 12 months from the date of signing these financial statements.
Accordingly the Directors consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts.

However Capco has adopted a CR policy and a supply chain policy which reflect a responsible approach to human rights.
MODERN SLAVERY In accordance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015 the Board has approved a Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement which has been published on our website.
The statement details the steps we take to avoid slavery and human trafficking in our own operations and in our supply chain.
We believe that our own operations present minimal risk but recognise that a higher level of risk is posed by the suppliers we engage with to provide goods and services.
During 2017 we undertook an extensive assessment of a major development site within the Capco portfolio in conjunction with the contractor with the objective of better understanding whether the policies and procedures in place are sufficient to mitigate the risks of modern slavery in the supply chain.
The assessment included interviews with management personnel from the contractor and also subcontractor site workers.
A followup meeting was held with the contractor to discuss findings and recommendations from the assessment.
We also delivered bespoke training on modern slavery and human trafficking to relevant employees and incorporated further information on Capcos expectations in relation to modern slavery into our procurement processes and policies.
In the year ahead we plan to provide further guidance to our employees and continue our ongoing engagement with our suppliers.

Capco aims to minimise the impact of our operations on the environment.
We apply a responsible and forwardlooking approach to environmental issues and the principles of sustainability.
ENERGY and CARBON MANAGEMENT In 2017 we reduced our energy use and carbon emissions by six per cent and seven per cent respectively on a likeforlike basis compared with 2016 exceeding our reduction target of three per cent.
Steps to improve the energy efficiency of our assets remained a key focus and as part of major refurbishment works we have installed more efficient boilers lighting and improved heating and cooling controls.
At Covent Garden the rollout of LED lighting continues across the estate solar panels were installed at Carriage Hall and we continue to purchase electricity via green energy tariffs to further reduce our carbon footprint.
Throughout the year we have closely monitored the Energy Performance Certificate EPC ratings of our assets and have taken action to increase the number of assets with an EPC rating of at least an E.
For Phase 1 of Lillie Square we achieved our target of all apartments achieving at least an EPC C rating.
In 2018 with the introduction of the governments Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards MEES our activities to upgrade assets with an EPC rating lower than an E will continue.
AIR QUALITY In 2017 we sought to gain an improved understanding of air quality within Covent Garden and funded the repair of an air quality monitor located in Covent Garden.
The air quality is monitored via an application called London Air which is run in conjunction with Kings College London.
Covent Garden regularly records the lowest level of air pollution measured by the application.
In 2017 the GLA designated Covent Garden and our neighbours the Northbank Business Improvement District as one of only two Business Low Emission Neighbourhoods in Westminster.
We continue to work collaboratively to further enhance air quality in the district.
WASTE and WATER MANAGEMENT Minimising the amount of waste sent to landfill and improving recycling rates are ongoing priorities across our estates.
Within our offices we have continued to promote recycling by sharing recycling statistics via the intranet and continue to divert all waste from landfill.
As part of the waste consolidation strategy at Covent Garden we have engaged with tenants to raise awareness of the importance of recycling and the waste collections services available.
Over a third of estate waste was recycled with the remaining waste being sent to an energy from waste plant that helped to generate 185 megawatts of energy.
We are actively monitoring water consumption and identifying opportunities to reduce usage.
Rainwater harvesting has been installed to help supply the irrigation to the Covent Garden living wall and water efficient fittings are being installed as part of refurbishment works.
Reduced energy use by six per cent compared with 2016 on a likeforlike basis exceeding our three per cent reduction target.

OUR COMMITMENTS IN 2018 Capco Annual Report and Accounts 2017 52 Corporate responsibility continued GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS In accordance with the Companies Act 2006 Strategic Report and Directors Report Regulations 2013 Capco continues to monitor and report on the greenhouse gas emissions associated with its operations.
We have used DEFRA Environmental Reporting Guidelines and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard to calculate emissions.
We have adopted the operational control consolidation method as this reflects where we have the ability to influence energy use and we have set a materiality threshold of five per cent for greenhouse gas reporting purposes.
Capco has engaged with Carbon Credentials Energy Services Limited to provide independent verification of the 2017 greenhouse gas emissions assertion in accordance with industry recognised standard ISO 140643.
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS DATA FOR YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 2017 Emission source Marketbased method tCO2 Locationbased method tCO2e 2tel 2016 Scope 1 emissions Direct emissions including fuel combustion in owned or controlled boilers and vehicles Not reported 752 1289 Scope 2 emissions Indirect emissions released into the atmosphere including purchased electricity 641 277 1979 4645 Total annual scope 1 and 2 emissions Not reported 2731 5934 Intensity ratio Tonnes of CO2e per m of Net Assets 0.88 1.87 The marketbased method reports emissions as tonnes of carbon dioxide tCO2.
Factors such as the addition of new electricity supplies for Lillie Square Phase 1 higher supplier emission factors and changes of supplier have led to an increase in marketbased emissions.
The locationbased method reports emissions as tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent tCO2e.
The sale of Olympia London in April 2017 caused a notable reduction in locationbased emissions.
RESPONSIBLE DEVELOPMENT Capco is committed to integrating responsible and sustainable practices into the delivery of our projects and development.
Efforts to certify our major construction projects to industry sustainability standards continue with the refurbishment of Regal House receiving our first Ska rating of Silver Carriage Hall achieving BREEAM Very Good status and Phase 1 of Lillie Square attaining Code for Sustainable Homes Level 4 certification.
At Earls Court the responsible management of demolition waste has been a key priority.
By identifying opportunities to reuse material on site and carefully segregating waste streams for recycling we have diverted 99 per cent of nonhazardous waste from landfill.
In 2017 we also focused on introducing more planting and greenery across our portfolio.
At Covent Garden we installed a living wall covering over 1500 square feet and containing over 8000 plants to refine the quality of the air increase the areas biodiversity and capture pollution particles.
We also introduced further flower crates and barrows across the estate.
At Lillie Square we introduced a series of new gardens created by awardwinning landscape designer Andy Sturgeon.
The contemporary gardens introduced 95 new trees over 100 different species of plants and bird bat and hedgehog boxes to the area.
Capco remains an active member of the UK Green Building Council.
SUSTAINABILITY INDICES We monitor and report our performance in line with industry sustainability benchmarks.

At a Group level the governance and reporting framework implemented during 2016 is now fully embedded across the business.
The Sector Safety Leadership Teams SSLTs met regularly during the year to consider health and safety matters for each asset and to implement the Groups Occupational Health and Safety Management System OHandSMS at operational level.
The SSLTs are overseen by the Group Safety Leadership Team GSLT which is chaired by our General Counsel and Director of Corporate Services and championed by the Managing Director and Chief Investment Officer who is responsible for health and safety at Board level.
The GSLT reviews health and safety performance across the Group regularly throughout the year and facilitates the sharing of lessons learnt and best practice across the management team.

In line with our OHSAS 18001 compliant OHandSMS a detailed health and safety management review was undertaken during the year to ensure that the system remained appropriate and continued to operate effectively.
A detailed review of fire safety issues including fire protection measures across the Groups assets was also undertaken and no areas of concern were identified.
Capcos Groupwide business continuity and major incident response plans were tested and refreshed during 2017 using scenariobased desktop exercises focused on each asset.

Capco Annual Report and Accounts 2017 56 Corporate governance report OUR GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK Ian Durant Chairman Dear Shareholder I am pleased to introduce Capcos 2017 Corporate Governance
A key focus of the Board during 2017 was consideration of corporate strategy in light of the ongoing uncertain market conditions and political outlook.
Management is implementing the strategy within a robust governance framework which includes a commitment to the highest standards of business practice and ethics.
The Corporate Governance Statement together with the Committee reports that follow explain how Capcos governance framework works and how the Company applied the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code during the year.
We also provide information on some of the management committees that support the controls and reporting framework across the Group and constitute an environment of integrity transparency and openness.
I am pleased to confirm that this governance framework continues to ensure that the Company operates effectively.
Capcos governance regime reflects the nature of the Company including our large property holdings in well known London locations Covent Garden and Earls Court and the relatively small executive team in a business which now employs about 100 people directly.
During the year there were a number of changes to the Board.
In January Situl Jobanputra took up his new position as Chief Financial Officer and we welcomed Charlotte Boyle to the Board in October.
We were sorry to lose Demetra Pinsent from the Board during the year as a result of the increasing time requirements of her other roles.
Promoted from within the business Situls appointment reflects Capcos commitment to developing the talent of our employees.
Charlotte is an experienced board adviser and brings expertise in people matters including remuneration talent development and succession planning as well as a close knowledge of UK Real Estate leadership.
I am delighted to report that both Situl and Charlotte have settled in well and are accordingly effective in their new roles.
You can read more about Capcos recruitment process and the tailored inductions that we provide to new Directors in the Nomination Committee Report from page 65.
Board composition and succession planning remains an area of focus for the Board and regular reviews are undertaken to ensure that the Board has and will continue to have the appropriate mix of skills and experience to deliver Capcos strategic goals.
As part of this process an updated Board diversity policy has been adopted which is described in greater detail within the Nomination Committee Report.
During 2018 the Board will carefully consider the implications of any updates to the UK Corporate Governance Code arising from the Financial Reporting Councils ongoing consultation.
All of the Directors will be seeking election or reelection at our
Andrew Strang Henry Staunton and Graeme Gordon have each served on the Board for more than six years.
Accordingly before recommending that they be reappointed the Nomination Committee gave particular consideration to the contribution of each Director and the balance of independence of the Board.
Capco has its primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and is also listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and over 50 per cent of the Companys shares are now held by South African investors.
There are sometimes different market expectations in the UK and South Africa and one example of this is the level of authority to issue new shares that shareholders expect to grant to boards.
The Board feels that to preserve flexibility it is appropriate to seek the higher levels of authority expected by UK shareholders where possible.
This has resulted in significant votes against two of our AGM resolutions and Capcos inclusion in The Investment Associations public register of shareholder dissent.
The Board will maintain dialogue with our South African shareholders on this topic as we move into 2018.

20 February 2018 STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE The Company has applied the principles and complied with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code the Code during 2017.
A governance framework that supports the achievement of Capcos strategic objectives.
Financial statements Strategic report Governance THE BOARD The Board is collectively responsible for the longterm success of the Company and for its leadership strategy values standards control and management.
Daytoday management of the Group is delegated to the Executive Directors subject to formal delegated authority limits however certain matters have been reserved for Board approval.
These matters are reviewed annually and include Board and Committee composition strategy significant funding decisions and corporate transactions delegated authority limits and dividend policy.
Board composition As at 31 December 2017 the Board comprised the Chairman three Executive Directors and six Nonexecutive Directors.
The table on page 58 summarises the membership of the Board and Committees.
Biographies of each of the Directors can be found on pages 54 and 55 and additional information on Directors skills and experience is included on page 67.
Board independence The Code requires that excluding the Chairman at least half of the Board should comprise Nonexecutive Directors determined to be independent.
The Board has considered the independence of the Nonexecutive Directors including potential conflicts of interest and the table on page 58 sets out those Directors considered to be independent in character and judgement.
Each of these Directors has also confirmed that there is no reason why they should not continue to be considered independent.
In considering Director independence the Board concluded that Directors tenure should be counted from the date of their first election by shareholders to the Capco Board.
The key responsibilities of Board members are set out in the table on page 59.
THE BOARD IN 2017 The Board met formally throughout the year with main meetings timed around the financial calendar and additional meetings convened to consider specific matters as required.
Attendance at Board and Committee meetings held during 2017 is shown on page 61.
The annual Board calendar includes a twoday strategy meeting.
At this meeting the Board receives detailed updates from external advisers and business divisions and is able to consider strategic issues in depth and spend time with members of senior management in a less formal environment.
Board papers are circulated a week in advance of meetings to ensure that Directors have sufficient time to consider their content prior to the meeting.
If matters require approval at short notice written approval is sought from the Directors.
The Chairman meets regularly with the Nonexecutive Directors without the Executive Directors being present and maintains regular contact with both the Chief Executive and members of senior management.
As matters that require the Boards decision are often large complex and evolve over a period of time informal update meetings are held between Board meetings to allow Board members adequate time to explore understand and challenge matters under consideration.
These are often combined with site visits and provide an opportunity for the Nonexecutive Directors to meet senior management.
Four such updates were held during 2017 including a visit to the Earls Court Project Room.
During 2017 the Board received regular asset financial and performance updates from the Executive Directors and senior management from each asset and reports from the General Counsel and Director of Corporate Services General Counsel the Company Secretary and Committee Chairmen.
The table below shows the key areas considered by the Board during the year.
BOARD COMMITTEES The Board has established Audit Remuneration and Nomination Committees to enable the Board to operate effectively and ensure a strong governance framework for decision making.
Each Committee has written terms of reference which are reviewed annually.
The terms of reference can be viewed on the Companys website site Minutes of all Committee meetings are made available to all Directors.
The Committee Chairmen attend the AGM to answer any questions on the Committees activities.
A number of management committees support the business in delivering its strategy.
A summary of the role of each Committee is shown on page 58 and the activity of each Committee during 2017 is described on pages 62 to 86.

Viability statement Effectiveness of External Auditor and recommendation for reappointment Risk management review Internal controls Viability statement review Corporate governance policies NonAudit Services Policy and Committee Terms of Reference 2018 Internal Audit Plan The external auditors are not permitted to perform any work that they may subsequently need to audit or which might either create a conflict of interest or affect the auditors objectivity and independence.
Access to Committee The external auditors have direct access to the Audit Committee Chairman should they wish to raise any concerns outside formal Committee meetings.
Effectiveness of auditors The Committee monitored PwCs effectiveness and performance during 2017 and considered a paper prepared by the Financial Controller which confirmed that in managements view PwC was providing an independent and goodquality audit service and continued to deliver against all facilities considered at their appointment.
Matters considered in reaching this conclusion included audit partner rotation continuity of audit team commitment to understanding the Groups business and transactions and the level of technical challenge on the Groups accounts and accounting policies.
The Committee is satisfied that the external auditors remain independent and objective are able to challenge management where appropriate and that the Groups audit is robust and objective.
The Committee has therefore recommended to the Board that PwC be reappointed in 2018.
Tendering of external audit contract Capco tendered its external audit contract in 2010 and PwC was appointed as Group auditors on an annual rolling contract.
This is the second year in which Jeremy Jensen has been the audit engagement partner.
The Directors plan to complete an audit SIGNIFICANT ISSUES CONSIDERED BY THE COMMITTEE IN 2017 Matter considered What the Committee did Valuations As in previous years the independent external valuers presented the year end and half year valuations to the Committee at the February and July meetings respectively.
The Committee reviewed the valuation process and component parts of the valuations discussed the valuations with the external auditors and challenged the valuers on the assumptions used.
The
Committee also advised the Board on the independence of the valuers and obtained confirmation that management had provided all requested information.
The Committee was satisfied that the approach taken by the valuers was appropriate.
Further information can be found in note 15 on pages 116 to 119 of the notes to the accounts.

The Committee was satisfied that the policy was appropriate for the Group.
Further information can be found in note 27 on page 130 of the notes to the accounts.
Significant and complex transactions As in previous years the Committee received updates from the Financial Controller on significant and complex transactions at each meeting.
With regard to each transaction such as the CLSA the Innova Investment joint venture impairments of other receivables and the sale of Olympia the Committee discussed the accounting treatments with management and the external auditors and is satisfied that the appropriate approach has been taken. be tendered to comply with regulatory requirements.
This is in the best interest of the Companys members because it will ensure continuity of service from the external auditors.
The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities Order 2014 statement of compliance The Company confirms that it complied with the provisions of the Competition and Markets Authoritys Order for the financial year under review.
Nonaudit services Nonaudit services are normally limited to assignments that are closely related to the annual audit or where the work is of such a nature that a detailed understanding of the Group is necessary.
During the year the Committee reviewed its nonaudit services policy and adopted an updated policy consistent with the Financial Reporting Council FRCs current Ethical Standard.
The purpose of the policy is to ensure that the provision of nonaudit services by the external auditors does not compromise their independence or objectivity.
A number of nonaudit services which reflect the FRCs list of prohibited nonaudit services are prohibited under the policy.
The policy requires the Audit Committee Chairman to approve in advance any nonaudit work with a cost exceeding 75000 for work related to the interim review or for other projects the lower of 50000 or 15 per cent of the estimated annual level of the auditors fees at that time.
The total value of nonaudit services in a financial year must not exceed 70 per cent of the average of the fees paid to the external auditors in the last three Capco Annual Report and Accounts 2017 64 consecutive years for the audit of Capco its Group undertakings and joint ventures.
Services below this limit are preapproved by the Audit Committee under the policy subject to consideration and approval by an Executive Director.
Approval is only given following a full and thorough assessment of the value case for using the auditors the skills and experience the auditors would bring and determination that the auditors are the most suitable provider of the service.
Additionally consideration must be given to the preservation of auditor independence and in advance of providing nonaudit services the external auditors are required to report that they are acting independently that provision of the nonaudit services does not impair their objectivity and that they are not auditing their own work making management decisions for the Company creating a mutuality of interest being remunerated via a contingent success fee developing close personal relationships with the Companys personnel or acting in the role of advocate for the Company.
The Committee is satisfied that the policy is operating effectively.
The total fees paid and payable to PwC in 2017 were 435000 of which 66000 related to nonaudit work.
The nonaudit work relates to the interim review and agreed upon procedures on the verification of balances for contractual arrangements the verification of share scheme performance outcomes and other regulatory requirements.
The total fees paid and payable to PwC in 2017 and 2016 are set out in the table below.
2017 2016 Total fees paid to PwC 435000 464000 Nonaudit fees 66000 63000 Ratio of nonaudit fees 15.2% 13.6% Restated to include interim review fees which are now considered to relate to nonaudit work.

Risk management
The Board has overall responsibility for the Groups risk management framework and system of internal control and the ongoing review of their effectiveness it also determines the risk appetite of the Group and regularly reviews principal risks and uncertainties.

Financial statements Strategic report Governance Nomination Committee report
COMMITTEE REPORT in 2010.
It is our intention that over the next two to three years in the normal course of succession management our Board composition will better reflect the diversity within the Company particularly as regards gender.
In 2018 the Committee will continue to monitor Board composition including Directors tenure skills experience and diversity to ensure that the Board is best placed to deliver Capcos strategy and will consider succession planning for all Directors particularly in the context of new governance regulations.
Finally all the Directors will be seeking election or reelection at the forthcoming AGM.
In accordance with best practice the Nomination Committee gave particular consideration before recommending that Andrew Strang Henry Staunton and Graeme Gordon who have each served on the Board for more than six years be reappointed.
I am pleased to report that the Committee concluded that each of these Directors continues to make a valuable contribution to the work of the Board and its Committees.
I am pleased to introduce Capcos 2017 Nomination Committee Report.
During 2017 the Committee continued to focus on Board composition undertaking a rigorous recruitment process following which we were pleased to welcome Charlotte Boyle to the Board.
At this time the Board did give consideration to appointing two new Directors however in light of the Companys current focus on cost control it was not felt to be appropriate to make a second appointment at this time.
The Committee monitored Situl Jobanputras performance following his promotion to the Board and I am delighted to report that Situl has settled excellently into his new role.
The Committee also spent time considering diversity both at Board level and within the wider business context.
During the year I was pleased to engage with the 30% Club and a number of our shareholders on this topic.
This was a good opportunity to explain Capcos approach to recruitment of Directors diversity across Capcos business and the diversity initiatives in which Capco participates.
Following this engagement the Committee encouraged the Board to review and update its Board Diversity Policy to ensure that it properly reflects the Boards view of the benefits of diversity.
We report on the revised Policy within this report.
Whilst the Board does not currently meet the Hampton Alexander Reviews target for womens representation on Boards it is notable that half of our Nonexecutive Director appointments since 2010 have been women and that female representation within Capcos senior management has been consistently strong.
We have also been in line with the Parker Reports recommendation on ethnic diversity since our inception Ian Durant Chairman of the Nomination Committee Ian Durant Chairman of the Nomination Committee 20 February 2018

Director induction An induction programme is provided for each new Director which is tailored depending on the individuals experience and expected role on the Board.
A typical induction programme for a Capco Nonexecutive Director will include individual meetings with the Chairman Executive Directors General Counsel Company Secretary and members of senior management site tours of Capcos estates with management and meetings with the Companys brokers advisers and lawyers.
The Director is also provided with copies of past Board and Committee papers and minutes and individual briefings are arranged on topics such as Directors duties and responsibilities remuneration structure and regulations and the property market.
The Company provided Charlotte Boyle with a full induction programme on her appointment.
Charlotte commented that the programme was comprehensive and enjoyable and helped her quickly gain an understanding of the Companys operations. promotion to the Board.
Director development The Chairman and the Committee together ensure that Directors keep their skills and knowledge up to date to allow them to fulfil their roles on the Board and Board Committees.
The General Counsel and Company Secretary regularly update the Board on legal and corporate governance matters and information on training opportunities and seminars is circulated to Directors.
The
Company also arranges periodic briefings from external advisers and Directors receive regular business updates from the Executive
Directors may also take independent advice at the Companys expense where they feel this is appropriate.
The Nomination Committee has responsibility for making recommendations on Board appointments and succession to the Board.
The members of the Committee as at 31 December 2017 and the date of this report are listed in the box on the previous page.
The
Nomination Committee met four times during the year and attendance at these meetings is shown in the table on page 61.
Board composition and succession The Committee regularly considers Board composition and succession planning for both Executive and Nonexecutive
In considering Executive Director succession the Boards strategy is to consider both internal and external candidates whilst aiming to develop a choice of internal potential successors.
The focus of Nonexecutive Director succession planning is to ensure that the Board and its Committees continue to have the right mix of skills and experience to deliver Capcos strategy.
A summary of Directors core skills and experience is shown in the table to the right.
Board succession and composition will continue to be considered at Committee meetings during 2018 and the Committee will make recommendations to the Board where appropriate.
This is likely to include the appointment of an additional Nonexecutive Director with property expertise at such time as a suitable candidate is identified.
However the Committee is satisfied that there is no immediate urgency in making this appointment.
Director recruitment Capco operates a rigorous and transparent recruitment process for new Directors which is summarised above.
Following Demetra Pinsents decision to leave the Board due to the increasing time requirements of her other roles the Committee initiated a search for one or more new Nonexecutive Directors.
Lygon Group which provides no other services to the Company was engaged to assist with the process and a broad brief setting out desired skills aptitudes and experience was prepared to ensure that the longlist of candidates was appropriately diverse and matched to the strategic needs of the Company.
The Committee considered a shortlist of two female candidates with different experience and having concluded that it would be inappropriate to make two appointments at a time when the Company was focusing on cost savings recommended that Charlotte Boyle be appointed to the Board.
In approving the Nomination Committee considers Board composition and determines desired skills and experience A shortlist of executive search firms is prepared and a selection process followed A person specification is prepared All Directors the General Counsel and the Company Secretary are given the opportunity to meet the preferred candidate The Chairman and Chief Executive meet with shortlisted candidates and provide feedback to the Committee A list of candidates is identified DIRECTOR RECRUITMENT PROCESS The Committee makes a formal recommendation to the Board site 67 Financial statements Strategic report Governance
Diversity is important to Capco and the Board recognises that diversity of experience and perspective can bring benefits across the business.
During 2017 the Board reviewed its Diversity Policy to ensure that it aligns with the Committees aim of ensuring that the Board has the right mix of skills and experience to deliver Capcos strategy and properly reflects the Boards view of the benefits of diversity.
Capcos refreshed Board Diversity Policy states that when considering the nomination of new Directors the Nomination Committee will evaluate the balance of skills knowledge and experience on the Board to establish the particular skills experience and aptitudes desirable for that appointment.
Such evaluations will pay particular attention to the merits of diversity including diversity of gender race age and background.
The Board remains committed to encouraging diversity and intends that over the next two to three years in the normal course of succession management its composition will become more reflective of the diversity across Capcos business particularly in respect of gender.
The Board Diversity Policy does not include targets for gender or other characteristics however in conducting searches Capco will only use executive search firms that are signatories to the Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms and will require diverse candidate shortlists from which appointments will be made on merit.
The Board believes that diverse shortlists increase the likelihood of identifying the best candidates for each appointment.
The refreshed Diversity Policy reflects Capcos past approach to recruitment of Nonexecutive Directors under which half of new Nonexecutive Director appointments since 2010 have been women and which has supported a number of candidates in obtaining their first listed company Board appointments.
During the period Demetra Pinsent left the Board and Charlotte Boyle was appointed.
Although there was not an opportunity to increase female representation on the Board without increasing Director numbers Charlottes appointment meant that the gender balance of Capcos Board did not reduce following Demetras departure.
The composition of the Board will be kept under review to ensure that the best balance of skills and experience is maintained and the effectiveness of the Board Diversity Policy will be monitored by the Nomination Committee.
Below Board level there is strong female representation within Capcos senior management team and their direct reports which is summarised in the table to the right.
However as a company with a relatively small headcount a small number of changes can have a significant impact on the percentages.
Capco is supportive of employee development including those who wish to seek nonexecutive roles elsewhere and provides development opportunities including mentoring from our Nonexecutive Directors.
It is hoped that such initiatives will help develop the next generation of Board members either within Capco or in the wider business world.
The Company also supports a number of initiatives which promote diversity within the property industry such as the Real Estate Balance initiative and the RICS Inclusive Employer Quality Mark as well as working with peer companies to promote diversity and equal opportunities.
More information on Capcos people practices and diversity initiatives can be found on pages 47 and 48 of the Corporate Responsibility Report.

REMUNERATION REPORT
In line with the framework set for the annual bonus at the beginning of the year the Committee adjusted the NAV and EPS targets following the disposal of the Venues business on 7 April 2017.
The adjustment was made to ensure that the targets remained as stretching as intended when originally set at the start of 2017 and the targets did not become more or less challenging to achieve as a result of the adjustment.
This year the Remuneration Committee has improved the disclosure of annual bonus targets.
The Committee has previously committed to publish the financial performance targets once they cease to be commercially sensitive which was two years retrospectively.
However the Committee understands that an increasing number of shareholders and governance bodies are in favour of earlier disclosure.
As a result from this year forward annual bonus targets will be disclosed one year retrospectively.
Implementation of the remuneration policy in 2018 In 2018 the operation of the remuneration policy will be in line with its operation in 2017.
The policy comprises base salary benefits and pension annual bonus and PSP awards.
The
Remuneration Committee has taken the following decisions with regard to the implementation of these elements in 2018 Base salary increases for the Chief Executive and Managing Director and Chief Investment Officer will be approximately two per cent in line with the lower end of the range of inflationbased increases for the general workforce.
The
Committee is satisfied that these increases are merited by the performance of each Director.
Upon his appointment in January 2017 it was agreed to bring the Chief Financial Officers base salary to market levels over time subject to his performance and development in the role with a review by up to 15 per cent in 2019 to recognise his experience gained.
Following an assessment of the performance of the Chief Financial Officer the Committee noted that he had performed very strongly during 2017 and his development in the role had significantly exceeded the Committees expectations.
ANNUAL STATEMENT Dear Shareholder I am pleased to present the Directors Remuneration Report for 2017.
This year was the first in which we implemented our new remuneration policy which was approved by shareholders at the 2017 AGM with 97.6 per cent of shareholders voting in favour.
The Committees key objectives as in previous years are to ensure that Capcos executive team is appropriately incentivised by remuneration arrangements that are fully aligned with the Companys strategy of providing longterm marketleading returns to shareholders.
Management incentives are linked to the KPIs which the Company uses to measure the creation and growth of value for shareholders.
These KPIs are described in full on page 15.
Performance in 2017 and variable remuneration outcomes Since its establishment in 2010 Capco has delivered TSR performance which ranks in the top quartile when compared with its listed peers.
However external market circumstances have again impacted Capcos financial performance and the variable remuneration outcomes reflect the impact of these market conditions.
The longterm incentive awards which would have vested in 2018 based on TSR and TR performance up to the end of 2017 are expected to lapse as neither the TSR or TR targets are expected to be met.
The financial elements of the 2017 bonus paid out at 55.5 per cent of maximum reflecting achievement of the EPS target and NAV performance which was between threshold and target but TPR results which were below threshold.
The individual performance measures were rated between 76 and 91 per cent of maximum and overall bonuses of between 90 and 96 per cent of salary were awarded to the Executive Directors of which half will be deferred as nil cost options under the Performance Share Plan PSP for three years.
Gerry Murphy Chairman of the Remuneration Committee A consistent approach with stretching targets site 69 Financial statements Strategic report Governance Gerry Murphy Chairman of Remuneration Committee 20 February 2018
Gerry Murphy Chairman Charlotte Boyle Henry Staunton Andrew Strang As a result the Committee decided to bring forward the potential 15 per cent increase to base salary so that it would be effective from April 2018.
This increase is considered appropriate as it reflects his strong performance in the role demonstrated by his overall contribution funding initiatives undertaken during the year and the identification and implementation of cost saving measures.
In awarding the increase the Committee was mindful of the impact that the increase would have on the Chief Financial Officers longterm incentive awards and concluded that the resulting incentive was appropriate.
The annual bonus will continue to be based 75 per cent on financial measures and 25 per cent on personal performance.
The weighting of the EPS annual bonus measure will be increased to 20 per cent of the financial performance measures to reflect the continued focus on cost management and income growth at Covent Garden.
The rebalanced NAV and TPR performance measures will be 50 per cent and 30 per cent of the financial performance measures respectively.
PSP awards of 350 per cent of salary will be granted in 2018.
Half of this award will be subject to a relative TSR performance condition whilst the remainder will be subject to a relative TR performance measure.
The Committee aims to set PSP performance targets that equate to an upper quartile level of performance and has noted that narrowing levels of outperformance within Capcos comparator group have made it more difficult for the maximum PSP TSR target to be achieved.
The Committee therefore sought shareholder views on whether it would be appropriate for the maximum PSP TSR target to be reduced.
However having considered feedback from shareholders the Committee concluded that no change to the TSR target would be made.
The PSP outperformance targets will continue to be kept under annual review.
Conclusion
We are proposing no changes to our policy having received shareholder approval at the 2017 AGM held on 5 May 2017.
This year we will only ask shareholders to approve the Annual Report on Remuneration and this Annual Statement.
We have included the remuneration policy in the Annual Report in order to provide clarity for our shareholders.
The Committee looks forward to receiving your support for this advisory vote at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
POLICY REPORT This section of the Directors Remuneration Report sets out Capcos remuneration policy which took effect following shareholder approval at the 2017 AGM.
In the interests of clarity the report includes some minor annotations to show where appropriate how the policy will be implemented in 2018.
A full version of the policy approved by shareholders can be found in the Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2016.
Details of actual remuneration paid share awards made and the approach to remuneration for 2018 are set out within the Annual Report on Remuneration which starts on page 76.
1.1 Remuneration policy The key objectives of the Companys remuneration policy are to strongly align executive and shareholder interests underpin an effective payforperformance culture support the retention motivation and recruitment of talented people who are commercially astute and encourage executives to acquire and retain significant holdings of Capco shares.
The Committee aims to achieve an appropriate balance between fixed and variable remuneration and between variable remuneration based on shortterm and longerterm performance.
Fixed remuneration includes base salary benefits and pension.
Variable remuneration includes an annual bonus half of which is deferred in shares and awards under the Performance Share Plan PSP.
The remuneration policy is aligned to the strategy and nature of the Company and reflects the importance of total return and the longterm nature of Capcos business rewarding the Executive Directors for delivering strong performance against the Companys Key Performance Indicators KPIs.
Details of each element of remuneration their operation purpose link to strategy and performance metrics are set out in this section.
Capco Annual Report and Accounts 2017 70 Directors remuneration report continued 1.2 Executive Director Policy Table The table below summarises each of the components of the remuneration package for the Executive Directors Operation Purpose and link to strategy To provide an appropriately competitive base salary whilst placing emphasis on the performance related elements of remuneration.
The Committee believes base salary for highperforming experienced Executive Directors should be at least median.
To be appropriately competitive with those offered at comparator companies.
To be appropriately competitive with that offered by comparator companies.
To incentivise and reward performance.
The Committee selects performance measures and targets each year to reinforce the strategic business priorities for the year.
The deferral of half of the bonus into shares is designed to further align executives with shareholders interests.
To incentivise and reward longterm outperformance and help retain Executive Directors over the longer term.
Base salaries are normally reviewed on an annual basis with any increase normally taking effect from 1 April.
The Committee reviews base salaries with reference to other property companies including the constituents of the longterm incentive plans comparator group UK companies of a similar size each Executive Directors performance and contribution during the year scope of each Executive Directors responsibilities changes to the remuneration and overall conditions of other employees When reviewing base salaries the Committee is mindful of the gearing effect that increases in base salary will have on the potential total remuneration of the Executive Directors.
Benefits will be in line with those offered to some or all employees and may include private dental and healthcare life insurance personal accident cover travel insurance income protection and a car allowance currently paid in cash.
Other benefits may be introduced from time to time to ensure the benefits package is appropriately competitive and reflects individual circumstances.
For example Directors may be offered relocation andor expatriate benefits should a Director be required to relocate as a result of emerging business requirements.
Capco offers a defined contribution pension scheme.
Executive Directors may elect to be paid some or all of their entitlement in cash.
The Company does not currently operate any All Employee Share Schemes however if such a scheme were introduced the Executive Directors would be able to participate on the same terms as other employees.
The annual bonus arrangements are reviewed at the start of each financial year to ensure performance measures and weightings are appropriate and support the business strategy.
The Committee reviews performance against the annual bonus targets but has the ability to take into account broader factors and subject to the 150 per cent of salary maximum may exercise twoway discretion to ensure that the annual bonus awarded properly reflects the performance of the Company and each Director.
Adjudication of bonuses will be explained in the Directors Remuneration Report.
50 per cent of any bonus earned is deferred in Capco shares or nil cost options for three years under the Performance Share Plan without further performance conditions but subject to risk of forfeiture should an Executive Director leave the Company in certain circumstances.
Directors may be entitled to be paid dividend equivalents on deferred bonus.
Deferred bonus is subject to malus as described in the notes to this table.
Executive Directors are eligible to receive awards of shares under the PSP which may be made as awards of shares or nil cost options at the discretion of the Committee.
In assessing the outcome of the performance conditions the Committee must satisfy itself that the figures are a genuine reflection of underlying financial performance and may exercise downwards discretion when determining the proportion of an award that will vest.
Dividend equivalents may be paid.
The Committee has the discretion in certain circumstances to grant andor settle an award in cash.
In practice this will only be used in exceptional circumstances for Executive Directors.
PSP awards are subject to malus and clawback as described in the notes to this table.

Annual Bonus Performance Share Plan PSP All Employee Share Schemes site 71 Financial statements Strategic report Governance Maximum opportunity Performance metrics In line with HMRC approved limits.
Base salary increases will be applied in line with the outcome of the annual review and will normally be in line with increases awarded to other employees.
However the Committee may make additional adjustments in certain circumstances to reflect for example an increase in scope or responsibility development in role to address an increase in size or complexity of the business to address a gap in market positioning andor to reward the longterm performance of an individual.
For the purposes of stating a maximum as required by the remuneration regulations no increase will be applied to an Executive Directors base salary if the resulting base salary would be above the upper quartile base salary for CEOs at companies in the FTSE 350.
Set at a level which the Committee considers appropriate in light of relevant market practice for the role and individual circumstances.
The cost of all benefits will not normally exceed 10 per cent of base salary with the exception of any future expatriate andor relocation benefits which would be disclosed in the annual report on remuneration.
Any reasonable business related expenses including tax thereon can be reimbursed if determined to be a taxable benefit.
The maximum contribution is 10 per cent of base salary for any Executive Director appointed on or after the 2017 AGM in line with the level available for other head office and Covent Garden employees.
Executive Directors appointed before the 2017 AGM receive 24 per cent of base salary as a defined contribution.
The maximum bonus opportunity for Executive Directors is 150 per cent of annual salary with a bonus of 75 per cent of salary payable for achieving target levels of performance.
No bonus is payable for below threshold performance.
The payment for threshold performance will not exceed 10 per cent of maximum.
Awards are made on a straightline basis for performance between threshold and target and on a separate straightline basis for performance between target and maximum.
Each year participants may be granted up to 350 per cent of salary in awards or nil cost options.
33 per cent of an award vests for threshold performance with full vesting taking place for equalling or exceeding maximum performance conditions and straightline vesting between threshold and maximum.
The Committee considers individual and Company performance when setting base salary as well as the general increase awarded to other employees.

Executives performance is measured relative to challenging oneyear targets in key financial operational and strategic measures.
The measures selected and their weightings vary each year according to the strategic priorities.
At least 75 per cent of the bonus will be measured against financial performance.
Measures and respective weightings used for the annual bonus for 2017 and proposed for next years annual bonus are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration on pages 78 to 81.
An explanation of how the performance measures were chosen and how the performance targets are set is given on page 72.
PSP awards vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant and are subject to a twoyear postvesting holding period.
The vesting of awards is subject to continued employment and the Companys performance over a threeyear performance period based 50 per cent on relative Total Return Net Asset Value growth plus dividends and 50 per cent on relative Total Shareholder Return For both measures performance is measured relative to a comparator group comprising the largest FTSE350 property companies.
The performance measures and weightings which apply to the PSP are reviewed by the Committee annually and subject to consultation with shareholders the Committee has discretion to make changes to the measures the weightings andor comparator group for future awards to ensure that they remain relevant to the Company strategy and are suitably stretching.
Details of the performance conditions for previous years awards and those proposed for 2018 awards are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration on pages 80 to 82.
An explanation of how the performance measures were chosen and how the performance targets are set is given on page 72.
Capco Annual Report and Accounts 2017 72 1.3 Notes to the Policy Table Performance measurement selection Annual Bonus Scheme Executive Directors may earn bonuses depending on the Companys financial performance and performance against individual performance targets designed to deliver strategic goals.
The current structure of the annual bonus performance conditions is illustrated within the Annual Report on Remuneration on page 81.
The financial performance measures and the importance of each are set out in the table below.
The Remuneration Committee has discretion to change the performance conditions in the annual bonus but within the bounds set out in the Remuneration Policy Table.
The annual financial performance targets are set by the Committee in the first quarter of each year following an analysis of external and internal expectations compiled by the Committees independent adviser.
The
Committee sets targets it believes to be appropriately stretching but achievable.
Longterm incentives As mentioned above the performance conditions for the PSP currently comprise two measures Threeyear relative Total Return TR growth in NAV per share plus dividends and Threeyear relative Total Shareholder Return TSR increase in price of an ordinary share plus dividends.
The Committee believes that these two measures are currently the most appropriate measures of longterm success for Capco as longterm relative performance provides an appropriately objective and relevant measure of Capcos success which is strongly aligned with shareholders interests.
The Committee believes that NAV growth is the most important internal measure of success for Capco at this time.
Accordingly the Committee considered it appropriate to reward NAV performance in both the short and longterm incentive arrangements with oneyear absolute NAV growth being used in respect of the annual bonus arrangements and threeyear relative NAV as the main component of threeyear Total Return being used in respect of the longterm incentives.
NAV is used as a performance measure by over half of FTSE350 property companies in their longterm incentive arrangements.
The
Companys NAV is based on independent external valuations carried out in accordance with RICS Valuation Professional Standards.
Relative TSR helps align the interests of Executive Directors with shareholders by incentivising share price growth and in the Committees view provides an objective measure of the Companys longterm success.
The current longterm incentive performance conditions are summarised within the Annual Report on Remuneration on page 82.
Performance is measured relative to a comparator group comprising the largest FTSE350 property companies and Capco.
The members of the comparator group are shown in Figure 4 on page 80.
In order for any awards to vest the Committee must also satisfy itself that the TR and TSR figures are a genuine reflection of underlying financial performance.
In assessing the extent to which the performance conditions have been met the Committee consults with its independent remuneration adviser.
The calculation of the returns is also reviewed by the Companys auditors as appropriate.
The performance targets are set by the Committee following an analysis of internal and external expectations and are believed to be appropriately stretching.
For future awards the Remuneration Committee has discretion to change the performance measures and weightings.
However any such changes would only be made after consulting with shareholders.
Discretions
Under the Annual Bonus Scheme and the PSP the Company has the standard discretions to take appropriate action in the event of unforeseen events which affect the schemes such as a variation in share capital as well as terminations and on a change in control as described in the policy.
The Committee does not intend to make adjustments to the methods by which it measures the performance conditions however it reserves the discretion to make adjustments in very exceptional circumstances.
Shareholders would be given details of any exercise of discretion.
Payments resulting from existing arrangements The Committee may make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office including exercising any discretions it has relating to such payments even though they are not in line with the policy set out in this report.
This will apply where the entitlement to the payment arose i before the 2014 AGM ii at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company and in the opinion of the Committee the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company or iii under a remuneration policy previously approved by the Companys shareholders.
For these purposes entitlements arising under the Companys previous remuneration policy as approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM will be incorporated into this policy payments includes the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and an entitlement under an award over shares arises at the time the award is granted.
Why are the current annual bonus performance measures appropriate for Capco Measure Reason Growth in Net Asset Value per share Considered by the Committee to be the most important driver of value creation for Capco at the present time.
Relative Total Property Return Rewards the additional portfolio value created by management over and above any changes in value from tracking the property market as a whole as measured by the IPD Total Return All Property Index an external benchmark widely used in the property industry.
Underlying Earnings Per Share Rewards value growth in net rental income as well as the management of financing and other costs.
Given the current stage of the Companys development the Committee considers EPS to be relatively less relevant as an indicator of value creation than growth in Net Asset Value per share.
However the focus on this metric has been increased for 2018.
Directors remuneration report continued site 73 Financial statements Strategic report Governance Malus and clawback Awards granted under the longterm incentive arrangements are subject to malus and clawback until the end of the respective holding periods.
Deferred bonus awards are subject to malus prior to vesting.
Reasons for malus and clawback include in the event of gross misconduct of a Director in the event of a material misstatement in the audited accounts of the Company for a period that was wholly or partly before the end of the financial year by reference to which any performance condition was assessed or in the event that the assessment of the satisfaction of any performance condition was based on error or inaccurate or misleading information.
In the latter two scenarios to the extent an overpayment resulted.
The application of any malus or clawback is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Remuneration of employees below the Board No element of remuneration is operated solely for Executive Directors.
Capco head office including Earls Court Properties and Covent Garden employees below the Board receive base salary benefits annual bonus and participate in the PSP.
The pension contribution for new Executive Directors has been set at the same level as available to employees at Capco head office including Earls Court Properties and Covent Garden.
However there are some differences in operation as set out below In exceptional circumstances such as recruitment longterm incentive awards may be granted without performance conditions to participants below the Board Employees below the Board are not subject to any minimum shareholding requirement and Incentive awards granted to employees below the Board may not be subject to holding periods clawback or malus.
Shareholding guidelines The Chief Executive is required to achieve a shareholding in the Company equivalent to 300 per cent of salary and the other Executive Directors are required to achieve a shareholding in the Company equivalent to 200 per cent of base salary to be achieved by retaining at least 50 per cent of any vested share awards net of tax or within three years.
The current shareholdings of the Executive Directors are set out on page 84.
The current Chairman is required to maintain a shareholding in the Company equivalent to 100 per cent of his base fee but this would be reviewed on any new appointment.
1.4 Performance scenario charts The potential reward opportunities illustrated in Figure 1 are based on the policy which will apply in 2018 applied to the base salary at the salary review date 1 April 2018 and provide estimates of the potential future reward opportunity for each Executive Director and the potential split between the different elements of remuneration under three different performance scenarios Below Threshold Target and Maximum.
The Below Threshold scenario includes base salary pension and benefits fixed pay.
No annual bonus or PSP elements are included variable pay.
The Target scenario includes fixed pay on target bonus and threshold vesting of PSP awards.
The Maximum scenario includes fixed pay maximum bonus and full vesting of PSP awards.
For variable pay the amounts illustrated are the normal maximum opportunities.
It should be noted that the PSP awards granted in a year do not normally vest until the third anniversary of the date of grant and are subject to a twoyear postvesting holding period.
The projected values of longterm incentives shown here exclude the impact of share price movement and dividends.

Depending on the timing of the appointment the Committee may deem it appropriate to set different annual bonus performance conditions to the current Executive Directors in the first performance year of appointment.
The maximum opportunity will be 150 per cent of salary consistent with policy.
In exceptional circumstances normal policy table limits may be exceeded on recruitment.
The maximum additional bonus opportunity will be limited to 50 per cent of salary.
Performance Share Plan New Executive Directors will be eligible to participate in the longterm incentive scheme set out in the remuneration policy table.
A PSP award can be made shortly following an appointment assuming the Company is not in a prohibited period.
The opportunity levels will be consistent with those disclosed in the table.
Other In determining appropriate remuneration for new Executive Directors the Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors including quantum the nature of remuneration and where the candidate was recruited from to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of Capco and its shareholders.
Remuneration may include An award made in respect of a new appointment to buy out existing incentive awards forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
In such cases the compensatory award would typically be a likeforlike award with similar timetovesting performance conditions and likelihood of those conditions being met.
The fair value of the compensatory award would not be greater than the awards being replaced.
To facilitate such a buyout the Committee may use an award under a different structure or an additional award under the PSP A relocation package should this be required For an overseas appointment the Committee will have discretion to offer costeffective benefits and pension provisions which reflect local market practice and relevant legislation and In the event that an employee is promoted to the Board the Company would honour any existing contractual arrangements.
1.6 Service contracts and exit payment policy The service contracts of Executive Directors are approved by the Remuneration Committee and are oneyear rolling contracts.
The commencement dates of the current contracts are shown below.
The service contracts may be terminated by either party giving one years notice to the other.
It is the Companys policy that termination payments should not exceed the Directors current salary and benefits for the notice period.
The service contracts may be viewed at the Companys registered office.
Where a Director may be entitled to pursue a claim against the Company in respect of hisher statutory employment rights or any other claim arising from the employment or its termination the Committee will be entitled to enter into a settlement agreement with the
The Company may pay a Directors legal fees in relation to any settlement agreement.
The Committee may pay reasonable outplacement fees where considered appropriate.
When considering exit payments the Committee reviews all potential incentive outcomes to ensure they are fair to both shareholders and participants.
The payment of any annual bonus is subject to the discretion of the Committee and both the cash and deferred share elements of an annual bonus would normally be payable at the normal payment date.
Any deferred share element could be paid in cash.
Any outstanding deferred bonus may be released or paid in cash subject to clawback for a period of three years from the date of grant.

The table below summarises how PSP awards are typically treated in specific leaver circumstances with the final treatment remaining subject to the Committees discretion for example an individual may be considered a good leaver for any other reason at the absolute discretion of the Committee and the vesting of awards may be reduced for good leavers.
Reason for leaving Timing of vesting Treatment of awards Good leaver Normal vesting date although the Committee has discretion to accelerate.
Payments are normally prorated for time and remain subject to outstanding performance conditions.
Where vesting is accelerated payments are further prorated to reflect the extent to which the performance conditions had been satisfied at the date of leaving.
The holding period would continue to apply.
Change of control Immediately Vesting will be prorated for time and remain subject to performance conditions.
However the Committee has discretion to allow awards to vest in full in such circumstances if it deems this to be fair and reasonable.
The holding period would cease to apply.
Any other reason Awards lapse There are no obligations on the Company contained within the existing Directors service contracts which would give rise to payments not disclosed in this report.
The service contracts of any futureappointed Directors will provide for mitigation in the event of termination.
1.7 Nonexecutive Director Policy Table The Nonexecutive Directors do not have service contracts but instead have letters of appointment.
The letters of appointment of the Nonexecutive Directors are reviewed by the Board annually and contain a onemonth notice period.
The Chairmans letter of appointment contains a 12month notice period.
The letters of appointment may be viewed at the Companys registered office.

NA Capco Annual Report and Accounts 2017 76 Directors remuneration report continued 1.8 External Directorships The Companys policy is to encourage each Executive Director to take up one or more Nonexecutive Directorships subject to Board approval.
Fees received for serving as a Nonexecutive Director of a company outside the Capco Group are retained by the Executive Director.
1.9 Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Company When setting Executive Director pay the Committee considers the remuneration and overall conditions of all employees.
As
Capco has a relatively small workforce the Committee does not consult with employees when deciding remuneration policy but it receives regular updates from the Head of HR on salary increases bonus and share awards made to Group employees and is aware of how the remuneration of Directors compares to that of other employees for example salary increases are generally in line with increases awarded to other employees which are set with reference to market data.
1.10 Consideration of shareholder views It is the Committees policy to consult with major shareholders as appropriate for example prior to finalising any major changes to its executive remuneration policy.

These awards have been included in the 2017 single figure as the performance conditions relating to these awards had been substantially but not fully completed during 2017.
The disclosure has been calculated assuming that zero per cent of the Former PSP awards and MSP awards will vest.
The 2016 multiyear variable comparators were previously disclosed on the basis described above assuming vesting of zero per cent and it is confirmed that the awards lapsed as the performance conditions were not satisfied.

2.5 Annual bonus outcomes for 2017
Executive Directors can earn bonuses of up to 150 per cent of salary.
Half of the bonus earned is deferred in Capco shares or nil cost options for three years subject to forfeiture should the Executive Director leave the Company.
Performance measures and targets Awards made in respect of the year ended 31 December 2017 were based 75 per cent on financial performance and 25 per cent on individual performance.
Financial measures The financial performance element for the year ended 31 December 2017 was based on growth in absolute NAV per share NAV Total Property Return relative to the IPD Total Return All Property Index TPR and underlying Earnings Per Share EPS.
When setting the annual targets for these measures in 2017 the Committee recognised the longterm nature of some aspects of the Companys strategy and the extent to which this would be reflected in these measures on a 12month horizon.
In line with the framework set for the annual bonus at the beginning of the year the NAV and EPS targets were adjusted following the disposal of the Venues business on 7 April 2017.
The adjustment was made to ensure that the targets remained as stretching as intended when originally set at the start of 2017 and did not become more or less challenging to achieve as a result of the adjustment.
The performance measures weightings and targets that applied in respect of the 2017 annual bonus are summarised in the table on the following page.
The Committee has previously committed to publishing the financial performance targets once they cease to be commercially sensitive.
The Committee has determined that the financial performance targets that applied in respect of the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2016 are no longer commercially sensitive accordingly the targets and the Companys performance against these targets are set out on the following page.
Bonus awards made in 2015 and 2016 were based 75 per cent on financial performance.
In future the Committee expects to disclose annual bonus targets one year retrospectively.
Personal measures The Committee assessed individual performance against a set of KPIs which align with the Companys objectives outlined on page 15 of the Annual Report.
These KPIs include Corporate objectives enhancing Capcos position and reputation in the market identifying monitoring and controlling risk including health and safety progress towards meeting mediumterm corporate objectives Financial objectives optimising liquidity and financing effective cost and capital expenditure management other budgeted KPIs Investment objectives strategic investment initiatives operation of joint ventures implementation of business plans achievement of planning targets and CRHR objectives personal development optimisation of organisational structure nurturing of future leaders promotion and support of CR initiatives.
Outcome of 2017 annual bonus performance measures Audited Outcome of financial objectives In respect of the year ended 31 December 2017 the Companys performance did not meet the threshold performance targets for TPR however the EPS target was exceeded and NAV performance was between threshold and maximum.
Accordingly awards of 62.4 per cent of salary were made to Ian Hawksworth Situl Jobanputra and Gary Yardley in respect of the financial performance measures.
Outcome of personal objectives The Executive Directors were considered to have delivered good performance in 2017 including delivery of cost efficiencies and streamlined organisational structure sale of the Venues business operation of joint ventures with TfL and Network Rail management of capital and corporate liquidity consideration of new business opportunities and personal development.
Accordingly awards of between 28.5 and 34.1 per cent of salary were made to the Executive Directors in respect of the individual performance measures.
A summary of the overall outcomes of 2017 annual bonus performance measures is shown in Figure 3 on page 79.

Capco Annual Report and Accounts 2017 80 Directors remuneration report continued 2.6 Longterm incentive outcomes for 2017 Audited In 2015 the following awards with a performance period of 20152017 were made under the Companys former Performance Share Plan Former PSP and former Matching Share Plan Former MSP Former PSP Awards of 150 per cent of salary were made to Executive Directors.
Former MSP Shares awarded in respect of Executive Directors deferred 2014 bonus were matched under the MSP on a 11 basis.
Additionally awards were made pursuant to the Committees 2013 invitation to Executive Directors to invest up to 150 per cent of 2013 salary between 2013 and 2015 subsequently extended to early 2016 when permitted by scheme headroom with an exceptional matching opportunity of 21.
Performance measures and outcomes for 2015 awards under the Former PSP and Former MSP Performance measures and targets The performance conditions for the Former PSP and Former MSP comprised two equally weighted measures Threeyear relative Total Return TR growth in NAV per share plus dividends Threeyear relative Total Shareholder Return TSR increase in price of an ordinary share plus dividends Where an exceptional award was made the additional matching opportunity could only be earned for performance above the normal stretch targets.
The performance targets are set out in Figure 4 below.
Performance outcome In early 2018 the Committee determined that Capcos TR was not expected to equal the median of the comparator group vs an outperformance target of 2.5 per cent per annum or 3 per cent for exceptional awards and that Capcos TSR was not expected to equal the median of the comparator group vs an outperformance target of 4 per cent per annum or 5 per cent for exceptional awards and as such the performance conditions relating to the 2015 Former PSP and Former MSP awards had not been met.
Accordingly the 2015 Former PSP and Former MSP awards are expected to lapse and no value has been included in the single figure disclosures in respect of these awards.

In April 2018 the salary of the Chief Executive and Managing Director and Chief Investment Officer will be increased by approximately two per cent to 607000 and 544000 respectively which is in line with the lower end of the range of increases expected to be applied to Group employees.
As explained in the Committee Chairmans letter on page 68 the review of the Chief Financial Officers salary previously intended for 2019 has been brought forward to 2018 and his salary will be increased in April 2018 by 15 per cent to 373750.

Annual bonus
The annual bonus opportunity will remain unchanged for 2018.
Performance conditions The financial performance targets for the year ended 31 December 2017 were based on growth in absolute NAV per share Total Property Return relative to the IPD Total Return All Property Index and underlying EPS.
The Committee has decided that whilst NAV and TPR continue to be of greatest importance to Capcos strategy in 2018 the weighting of EPS as a performance measure will be increased to 20 per cent of the financial performance measures in order to reflect the continued focus on the Groups cost structure and income growth at Covent Garden.
The rebalancing of weightings of the financial performance measures for 2018 is shown in the table below.
The relative weighting of financial and individual performance measures will remain unchanged.
The Committee will consider the appropriate weighting of the EPS measure on an annual basis.
Performance targets The TPR target is included in the Companys KPIs on page 15.
The KPIs are in part dependent upon the occurrence of certain discrete events.
Therefore whilst the outperformance targets that apply to the longterm incentives are disclosed the Board has decided that as the Group operates in two specific locations within the competitive central London property market prospective disclosure of specific shortterm NAV and EPS targets would provide a level of information to counterparties that could prejudice the Companys commercial interests.
The Committee will publish the performance targets retrospectively once they have ceased to be commercially sensitive which is expected to be one year in retrospect.
Further information on the Companys KPIs can be found on page 15.

Company Secretary 20 February 2018 Directors report continued site 89 Directors responsibilities site 89 STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS RESPONSIBILITIES The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts the Directors Remuneration Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year.
Under that law the Directors have prepared the Group and Parent Company financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing these financial statements the Directors are required to select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union EU have been followed subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements and prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Companys transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and as regards the Group financial statements Article 4 of the IAS
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Companys website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Each of the Directors whose names and functions are listed in the Governance section confirm that to the best of their knowledge the Group financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU give a true and fair view of the assets liabilities financial position and loss of the Group the Directors report contained includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces and having taken all matters considered by the Board and brought to the attention of the Board during the year into account the Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts taken as a whole are fair balanced and understandable.
The Directors believe that the disclosures set out in the Annual Report and Accounts provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Companys position performance business model and strategy.
The financial statements on pages 96 to 137 were approved by the Board of Directors on 20 February 2018 and signed on its behalf by Ian Hawksworth Situl Jobanputra Chief Executive Chief Financial Officer Financial statements Strategic report Governance Capco Annual Report and Accounts 2017 90 Independent Auditors Report to the Members of Capital and Counties Properties PLC Capco Annual Report and Accounts 2016 REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In our opinion Capital and Counties Properties PLCs Group financial statements and Parent Company financial statements the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Groups and of the Parent Companys affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the Groups loss and the Groups and the Parent Companys cash flows for the year then ended have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as regards the Parent Companys financial statements as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and as regards the Group financial statements Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements included within the Annual Report and Accounts the Annual Report which comprise the Group and Company balance sheets as at 31 December 2017 the Consolidated income statement and Consolidated statement of comprehensive income the Group and Company statements of cash flows and the Consolidated and Company statement of changes in equity for the year then ended and the notes to the financial statements which include a description of the significant accounting policies.
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.
Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing UK ISAs UK and applicable law.
Our
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK which includes the FRCs Ethical Standard as applicable to listed public interest entities and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief we declare that nonaudit services prohibited by the FRCs Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the Parent Company.
Other than those disclosed in the Audit Committee Report on pages 63 and 64 we have provided no nonaudit services to the Group or the Parent Company in the period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017.
Our audit approach
Materiality  Overall Group materiality 39 million 2016 41 million which represents 1 per cent of total assets.
Overall Parent Company materiality 20 million 2016 20 million which represents 1 per cent of total assets.
For income statement line items that are deemed to be of particular relevance we applied a lower materiality.
Audit scope  We audited the complete financial information of the Group which comprises three business lines Covent Garden Earls Court and Other.
We audited the financial information relating to the sale of Venues including the Venues results attributable to the Group for the approximately three month period until the disposal.
Key audit matters  Valuation of investment and development property
Disposal of the Venues business We determined that there were no key audit matters applicable to the Parent company to communicate in our report.
The scope of our audit As part of designing our audit we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements.
In particular we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.
We gained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the Group and the industry in which it operates and considered the risk of acts by the Group which were contrary to applicable laws and regulations including fraud.
We designed audit procedures to respond to the risk recognising that the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by for example forgery or intentional misrepresentations or through collusion.
We focused on laws and regulations that could give rise to a material misstatement in the Group and Parent Company financial statements including but not limited to the Companies Act 2006 and UK tax legislation.
Our tests included but were not limited to review of the financial statement disclosures to underlying supporting documentation enquiries of management and review of minutes of meetings of those charged with governance for the Group.
There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above and the further removed noncompliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements the less likely we would become aware of it.
We did not identify any key audit matters relating to irregularities including fraud.
As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls including testing journals and evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the Directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that in the auditors professional judgement were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement whether or not due to fraud identified by the auditors including those which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter Valuation of investment and development property Refer to pages 62 to 64 Audit Committee Report pages 102 to 106 Principal Accounting Policies and pages 102 to 137 notes to the financial statements.
The valuation of the Groups investment and development property is the key component of the net asset value and underpins the Groups result for the year.
The result of the revaluation this year was a loss of 90.9m 2016 loss of 231.2m which is accounted for within Loss on revaluation and sale of investment and development property and is a significant component of the result for the year.
The Groups property portfolios which comprise investment property including retail food and beverage commercial and residential as well as development property located in central London are not uniform in nature.
Therefore there are a number of different assumptions made by the Groups third party valuers JLL and CBRE Ltd the Valuers in determining fair value Investment property  The valuation of investment properties predominantly Covent Garden is inherently subjective due principally to the individual nature of each property which greatly influences the future rental it is expected to generate.
The assumptions on which the property values are based are influenced by tenure and tenancy details for each property prevailing market yields and the estimated rental value of each property.
Development property  The valuation of development property predominantly Earls Court is also inherently subjective.
Development properties are valued using the residual appraisal method i. return on development risk.
Macroeconomic factors and uncertain market conditions impact the valuation of investment and development property.
The fact that only a small percentage difference in individual property valuations when aggregated could result in a material misstatement warrants specific audit focus on this area.
The Valuers were engaged by the Directors in accordance with the RICS Valuation  Professional Standards RICS.
Experience of Valuers and relevance of their work We read the Valuers reports from CBRE Ltd and JLL.
We confirmed that the approaches used were consistent with the RICS guidelines and the requirements of IFRSs as adopted by the European Union.
We assessed the Valuers competence and capabilities and read their terms of engagement with the Group determining that there were no matters that affected their independence and objectivity or imposed scope limitations upon them.
Data provided to the Valuers For investment and development properties we validated a sample of the data provided to the Valuers by management and found that it was consistent with the information we audited.
This data included tenancy schedules capital expenditure details cost schedules and square footage details which we agreed back to appropriate supporting documentation.
For development properties we agreed that the planned schemes being valued were consistent with the actual planned developments and where appropriate had achieved planning consents.
Assumptions and estimates used by the Valuers We met with the Valuers independently of management and gained an understanding of the valuation methods and assumptions used.
We compared the movement in capital values over the period with market sector benchmarks to help identify significant changes in assumptions.
The nature of assumptions used varied across the portfolio depending on the nature of each property but they included estimated capital values investment yields estimated rental values construction costs finance cost and developers margins.
In each of these areas and on a sample basis we compared the estimates and assumptions used by the Valuers against our own expectations using evidence of comparable market transactions.
Where we identified estimates and assumptions that were outside the typical ranges used we discussed these with the Valuers to understand the rationale and then assessed based on all the available evidence and our experience in this sector whether the use of the estimate or assumption was justified.
Our testing which involved the use of our internal real estate valuation experts qualified chartered surveyors with deep market knowledge indicated that the estimates and assumptions used were appropriate in the context of the Groups property portfolio and reflected the circumstances of the market in the year.
Financial statements Strategic report Governance Capco Annual Report and Accounts 2017 92 Independent Auditors Report to the Members of Capital and Counties Properties PLC continued 92 Capco Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Refer to page 62 to 64 Audit Committee Report page 102 to 106 Principal Accounting Polices and pages 102 to 137 notes to the financial statements.
Tax is a specific risk for the Group due to the degree of judgement involved in some of the ongoing activities of the Group.
This gives rise to material tax considerations on the calculation recognition and classification of current and deferred tax balances from both a tax compliance and accounting perspective.
Judgements are made by management to arrive at the current and deferred tax position.
These judgements include the impact of the Group holding structure.
We assessed the principal assumptions and judgements made in arriving at the current and deferred tax position by using our experience of similar matters in the industry.
We evaluate the tax provisions and potential exposures as at 31 December 2017 challenging the Groups assumptions and judgements through our knowledge of the tax circumstances.
Our testing which involved the use of our internal tax specialists did not identify any matters that the Directors have not adequately reflected in their calculation of the necessary current and deferred tax provisions.
Disposal of the Venues business The disposal of a significant business component the Venues business during the year is considered higher risk as it is a significant nonroutine transaction.
We therefore placed specific audit focus on this area.
We performed substantive procedures over the sale agreement completion accounts and gain on disposal workings relating to the transaction.
We reviewed the related disclosures in the financial statements including the prior period representation.
We did not identify any material misstatements relating to the transaction.
We determined that there were no Key audit matters applicable to the Parent company to communicate in our report.
How we tailored the audit scope We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole taking into account the structure of the Group and the Parent Company the accounting processes and controls and the industry in which they operate.
The Group is structured along three business lines Covent Garden Earls Court Properties including the Lillie Square joint venture and the Empress State Building and Other.
The Venues business was disposed of during the year.
The Group engagement team audited all business lines including the Venues business results reflected in the Group results for the period.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality.
We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality.
These together with qualitative considerations helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows Group financial statements Parent Company financial statements Overall materiality 39 million 2016 41 million.
20 million 2016 20 million.
How we determined it 1 per cent of total assets.
1 per cent of total assets.
Rationale for benchmark applied The key measure of the Groups performance is the valuation of investment and development properties and the balance sheet as a whole.
On this basis and consistent with the prior year we set an overall Group materiality level based on total assets.
The Parent Companys main activity is the holding of investments in subsidiaries.
On this basis and consistent with the prior year we set an overall Parent Company materiality level based on total assets.
In addition to overall Group materiality a specific materiality was also applied to certain areas of the income statement.
Our specific materiality is aligned with the metrics in the consolidated income statement that we believe are of particular interest to the members and we determined those metrics to be Net rental income and Net finance costs.
In order to reflect their specific characteristics we applied materiality levels of 10 per cent of Net rental income and 10 per cent of Finance costs to each constituent line item within Net rental income and Net finance costs.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above 1.9 million 2016 2.0 million on balance sheet items as well as misstatements below that amount based on a proportionate value of the relevant materiality figures for income statement line items and other matters that in our view warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern In accordance with ISAs UK we report as follows Reporting obligation
We are required to report if we have anything material to add or draw attention to in respect of the Directors statement in the financial statements about whether the Directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements and the Directors identification of any material uncertainties to the Groups and the Parent Companys ability to continue as a going concern over a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements.

If based on the work we have performed we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report Directors Report and Corporate Governance Statement we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit the Companies Act 2006 CA06 ISAs UK and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority FCA require us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below required by ISAs UK unless otherwise stated.

We have nothing to report having performed a review of the Directors statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group and statement in relation to the longerterm viability of the Group.
Our review was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the Directors process supporting their statements checking that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code the Code and considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Parent Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit.

The section of the Annual Report on pages 62 to 64 describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
The Directors statement relating to the Parent Companys compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the Code specified under the Listing Rules for review by the auditors.
Directors Remuneration In our opinion the part of the Directors Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.

Financial statements Strategic report Governance Capco Annual Report and Accounts 2017 102 Notes to the accounts 102 Capco Annual Report and Accounts 2017 1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES General information Capital and Counties Properties PLC the Company was incorporated and registered in England and Wales on 3 February 2010 under the Companies Act as a public company limited by shares registration number .
The registered office of the Company is 15 Grosvenor Street London W1K 4QZ United
The principal activity of the Company is to act as the ultimate parent company of Capital and Counties Properties PLC Group the Group whose principal activity is the investment development and management of property.
The Groups assets principally comprise investment and development property at Covent Garden and Earls Court.
Basis of preparation The Groups consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRS IC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified for the revaluation of property and derivative financial instruments.
The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption offered by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present a separate income statement or statement of comprehensive income for the Company.
During 2017 the following accounting standards and interpretations have been adopted by the Group IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows amendment IAS 12 Income Taxes amendment These pronouncements had no significant impact on the consolidated financial statements and resulted in changes to disclosures only.
At the date of approval of the consolidated financial statements the following standards and interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not effective and in some cases have not been adopted for use in the European
IFRS 2 Sharebased Payment amendment IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 16 Leases IAS 28 Investments in Associates amendment IAS 40 Investment Property amendment Amendments to IFRS Annual improvements cycle 20142016 Amendments to IFRS Annual improvements cycle 20152017 The Group has assessed the impact of these new standards and interpretations and does not anticipate any material impact on the financial statements.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments modifies the classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities impairment provisioning and hedge accounting.
There is no change to the Group in respect of classification of financial assets and liabilities and hedge accounting.
All Group financial assets have been assessed for impairments under the 12 month and lifetime expected credit loss models considered by IFRS 9.
The adoption of the new standard does not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
In relation to IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers the Groups material revenue stream relates to property rental income.
On the adoption of the standard this revenue stream will not be materially impacted due to property rental income not being within the scope of IFRS 15.
The assessment of this standard also indicated that the impact on all other revenue streams is not material.
As the Group is predominantly a lessor IFRS 16 Leases will not have a material impact on adoption.
Where the Group is currently a lessee this relates only to immaterial contracts.
A summary of the Groups principal accounting policies which have been applied consistently across the Group is set out below.
Going concern The Directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements and for this reason the consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
Basis of consolidation These consolidated financial statements include the consolidation of the following limited partnerships Capital and Counties CGP Capco CGP 2012 LP CG Investments 2016 LP EC Properties LP Innova Investment Group Holdings LP and The Empress State LP.
The members of these qualifying partnerships have taken advantage of exemptions available in Statutory Instrument 2008569 and therefore will not produce consolidated accounts at the partnership level.
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in British pounds sterling which is also determined to be the functional currency of the Parent.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which the Group has control it is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with an entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over an entity.
Subsidiaries cease to be consolidated from the date this control is lost.
Noncontrolling interests are recognised on the basis of their proportionate share in the recognised amounts of a subsidiarys identifiable net assets.
On the balance sheet noncontrolling interests are presented separately from the equity of the owners of the Parent.
Profit or loss and total comprehensive income for the period attributable to noncontrolling interests are presented separately in the income statement and the statement of comprehensive income.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation and uncertainty The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the Directors to make judgements estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities equity income and expenses from sources not readily apparent.
Although these estimates and assumptions are based on managements best knowledge of the amount historical experiences and other factors actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period.
1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation and uncertainty continued The significant areas of estimation and uncertainty are Property valuation The most significant area of estimation and uncertainty in the consolidated financial statements is in respect of the valuation of the property portfolio where external valuations are obtained.
The valuation of the Groups property portfolio is inherently subjective due to the assumptions as outlined within note 15 Property Portfolio and this subjectivity may result in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities year on year.
As a result the valuations the Group places on its property portfolio are subject to a degree of uncertainty and are made on the basis of assumptions which may not prove to be accurate and could therefore have a material effect on the Groups financial performance and position.
The key areas of accounting judgement are Property classification Judgement is required in the classification of property between investment and development trading and owner occupied.
Management considers each property separately and reviews factors including the longterm intention for the property in determining if trading and the level of ancillary income in determining if owner occupied to ensure the appropriate classification.
Other less significant judgements and sources of estimation and uncertainty relate to revenue recognition significant disposals provisions sharebased payment and contingent liabilities.
Operating segments Management has determined the operating segments with reference to reports on divisional financial performance and position that are regularly reviewed by the Executive Directors who are deemed to be the chief operating decision makers.
Revenue recognition Rent receivable consists of gross income calculated on an accruals basis together with services where the Group acts as principal in the ordinary course of business excluding sales of property.
Rental income is spread evenly over the period from lease commencement to lease expiry.
Tenant lease incentive payments including surrender premiums paid which can be directly linked to enhanced rental income are amortised on a straightline basis over the lease term.
Upon receipt of a surrender premium for the early termination of a lease the profit and nonrecoverable outgoings relating to the lease concerned are immediately reflected in net rental income.
Contingent rents being those lease payments that are not fixed at the inception of a lease for example increases arising on rent reviews are recorded as income in the periods in which they are earned.
Where the outcome of an outstanding rent review is reasonably certain rent is accrued from the review date based upon an estimated annual rent.
Estimates are derived from knowledge of market rents for comparable properties determined on an individual property basis and updated for progress of negotiations.
Where revenue is obtained by the sale of property it is recognised when the significant risks and rewards have been transferred to the buyer.
This will normally take place on exchange of contracts unless there are conditions that suggest insufficient probability of future economic benefits flowing to the Group.
For conditional exchanges sales are recognised when these conditions are satisfied.
Revenue arising from the sale of property under construction is recognised when contracts have been exchanged the building work is physically complete and significant conditions with the buyer have been satisfied.
Other income Other income includes management fees charged to joint ventures for services associated with the management of properties and other general expenses as defined by management agreements.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate.
Foreign currencies Transactions in currencies other than the Companys functional currency are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing at the transaction date.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from settlement of these transactions and from retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement except for differences arising on the retranslation of availableforsale investments which are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Income taxes Current tax is the amount payable on the taxable income for the year and any adjustment in respect of prior years.
It is calculated using rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
In accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes deferred tax is provided for using the balance sheet liability method on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the tax bases of those assets and liabilities.
However temporary differences are not recognised to the extent that they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss or are associated with investments in subsidiaries joint ventures and associates where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled by the parent venture or investor respectively and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that management believes it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deferred tax assets can be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on either the same taxable group or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle balances on a net basis.
Tax is included in the income statement except when it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity in which case the related tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.
Discontinued operation A discontinued operation is a component of the Groups business that represents a separate major line of the business that has been disposed of or meets the criteria for classification as held for sale.
Discontinued operations are presented separately from continuing operations in both the income statement and statement of cash flows.
The comparatives have been represented as a result of the discontinued operation.
Sharebased payment The cost of granting share options and other sharebased remuneration to employees and Directors is recognised through the income statement with reference to the fair value of the instrument at the date of grant.

An option pricing model is used applying assumptions around expected yields forfeiture rates exercise price and volatility.
Upon eventual exercise a reserves transfer occurs with no further charge reflected in the income statement.
Own shares held in connection with employee share plans and other sharebased payment arrangements are treated as treasury shares and deducted from equity.
Investment and development property Investment and development property is owned or leased by the Group and held for longterm rental income and capital appreciation.
The Group has chosen to use the fair value model.
Property and any related obligations are initially recognised when the significant risks and rewards attached to the property have transferred to the
Payments made in respect of the future acquisition of investment and development property as is the case for the CLSA are initially recognised as prepayments until the recognition criteria outlined above have been met.
Investment and development property is recorded at cost and subsequently revalued at the balance sheet date to fair value as determined by professionally qualified external valuers on the basis of market value.
The fair value of property is arrived at by adjusting the market value as above for directly attributable tenant lease incentives and fixed head leases.
Property held under leases is stated gross of the recognised finance lease liability.
The valuation is based upon assumptions as outlined within the property portfolio note.
These assumptions conform with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS Valuation Professional Standards.
The cost of development properties includes capitalised interest and other directly attributable outgoings with the exception of properties and land where no development is imminent in which case no interest is included.
Interest is capitalised before tax relief on the basis of the weighted average cost of debt outstanding until the date of practical completion.
When the Group redevelops a property for continued future use that property is classified as investment and development property during the redevelopment period and continues to be measured at fair value.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment and development property are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Depreciation is not provided in respect of investment property including plant and equipment integral to such investment property.
Investment and development properties cease to be recognised as investment and development property when they have been disposed of or when they cease to be held for the purpose of generating rental income or for capital appreciation.
Disposals are recognised on completion.
Gains or losses arising are recognised in the income statement.
The gain on disposal is determined as the difference between the net sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset at the commencement of the accounting period plus capital expenditure in the period.
A property ceases to be recognised as investment and development property and is transferred at its fair value to trading property when in the Directors judgement development commences with the intention of sale.
Criteria considered in this assessment include the Boards stated intention contractual commitments and physical legal and financial viability.
When the use of a property changes from trading property to investment and development property the property is transferred at fair value with any resulting gain recognised in the income statement.
Trading property Trading property comprises those properties that in the Directors view are not held for longterm rental income or capital appreciation and are expected to be disposed of within one year of the balance sheet date or to be developed with the intention to sell.
Such property is constructed acquired or if transferred from investment and development property transferred at fair value which is deemed to represent cost.
Subsequently trading property is carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and selling costs.
Net realisable value approximates market value as determined by professionally qualified external valuers at the balance sheet date.
The amount of any write down of trading property to market value is recognised as an expense in the period the write down occurs.
Should a valuation uplift occur in a subsequent period the amount of any reversal shall be recognised as a reduction in the previous write down in the period in which the uplift occurs.
This may not exceed the propertys cost.
The sale of trading property is recognised as revenue when the significant risks and rewards have been transferred to the buyer.
Total costs incurred in respect of trading property are recognised simultaneously as an expense.
Leases
Leases are classified according to the substance of the transaction.
A lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee is classified as a finance lease.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Group as a lessee In accordance with IAS 40 Investment Property property held under finance and operating leases may be accounted for as investment property.
Finance leases are recognised as both an asset and an obligation to pay future minimum lease payments.
The investment property asset is included in the balance sheet at the lower of fair value and the present value of minimum lease payments gross of the recognised finance lease liability.
Lease payments are allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant financing rate.
Other finance leased assets are capitalised at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments and depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the useful life of the asset.
Rental expenses under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straightline basis over the lease term.
Plant and equipment Plant and equipment consist of fixtures fittings and other office equipment.
Plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset plus any attributable cost in bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straightline basis over an assets estimated useful life.
Currently the maximum life of the Groups plant and equipment is five years.
1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Investment in Group companies Investment in Group companies which eliminates on consolidation is stated in the Companys separate financial statements at cost less impairment losses if any.
Impairment losses are determined with reference to the investments fair value less estimated selling costs.
Fair value is derived from the subsidiarys and their subsidiaries net assets at the balance sheet date.
On disposal the difference between the net disposal proceeds and its carrying amount is included in the income statement.
Investment in joint ventures Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control established by contractual agreement.
Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
On initial recognition the investment is recognised at cost and the carrying amount is subsequently increased or decreased to recognise the Groups share of the profit or loss of the joint venture after the date of acquisition.
Goodwill if any on acquisition is included in the carrying amount of the investment.
The Groups investment in joint ventures is presented separately on the balance sheet and the Groups share of the joint ventures posttax profit or loss for the period is also presented separately in the income statement.
Where there is an indication that the Groups investment in joint ventures may be impaired the Group evaluates the recoverable amount of its investment being the higher of the joint ventures fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
If the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
If the Groups share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds its investment in the joint venture the Group does not recognise further losses unless it has legal or constructive obligations to make payments on behalf of the joint venture.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses nontrading derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to interest rate risk.
They are initially recognised on the trade date at fair value and subsequently remeasured at fair value based on market price.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and if so the nature of the item being hedged.
Instruments that have not been designated as qualifying for hedge accounting are classified as held for trading.
Changes in fair value of these instruments are recognised directly in the income statement.
The Group designates certain derivatives as hedges of a highly probable forecast transaction cash flow hedge.
For hedging instruments the Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking hedging transactions.
The Group also documents its assessment both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
The Directors exercise judgement as to the collectability of the Groups trade and other receivables and determine when it is appropriate to impair these assets.
Impairment of financial assets An annual review is conducted for financial assets to determine whether there is any evidence of a loss event as described by IAS 39 Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement.
Factors such as days past due credit status of the counterparty historical evidence of collection and probability of deriving future economic benefit are considered to assess whether there is objective evidence of impairment.
The amount of any potential loss is calculated by estimating future cash flows or by using fair value where this is available through observable market prices.
If in a subsequent period the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the original impairment was recognised the impairment reversal is recognised in the income statement on a basis consistent with the original charge.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are recognised at fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand deposits with banks and other shortterm highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Trade and other payables Trade payables are obligations for goods or services acquired in the ordinary course of business.
Trade and other payables are recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost until settled.
Deposits
Property deposits and on account receipts are held within trade and other payables.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a current obligation arising from a past event and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
Borrowings
Borrowings are ordinarily recognised initially at their net proceeds as an approximation of fair value.
If the transaction price is not an approximation of fair value at initial recognition the Group determines the fair value as evidenced by a quoted price in an active market for an identical instrument or based on a valuation technique that uses data from observable markets.
Where equity holders of the Group are party to the transaction the difference between the net proceeds and fair value is recognised within equity.
Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost.
Any transaction costs premiums or discounts are capitalised and recognised over the contractual life of the loan using the effective interest rate method or on a straight line basis where it is impractical to do so.
In the event of early repayment transaction costs premiums or discounts paid or unamortised costs are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Financial statements Strategic report Governance Capco Annual Report and Accounts 2017 106 Notes to the accounts continued 106 Capco Annual Report and Accounts 2017 1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
The costs of the defined contribution scheme and the Groups personal pension plans are charged against profits in the year in which they fall due.
Contingent liabilities and capital commitments Contingent liabilities are disclosed where there are present or possible obligations arising from past events but the economic impact is uncertain in timing occurrence or amount.
A description of the nature and where possible an estimate of the financial effect of contingent liabilities are disclosed.
Capital commitments are disclosed when the Group has a contractual future obligation which has not been provided for at the balance sheet date.
Amounts are only provided for where such obligations are onerous.
Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a deduction from equity net of any tax effects.
2 SEGMENTAL REPORTING Management has determined the operating segments based on reports reviewed by the Executive Directors who are deemed to be the chief operating decision makers.
The principal performance measures have been identified as net rental income and net asset value.
For management and reporting purposes the Group is organised into three divisions Covent Garden Earls Court Properties represents the Groups interests in the Earls Court area comprising properties held in ECPL Lillie Square the Empress State Building and a number of smaller properties in the Earls Court area and Other comprises Innova the discontinued activity of Venues and The Great Capital Partnership other head office companies and investments including the payment of internal rent.
Management information is reported to the chief operating decision makers on a Group share basis.
Outlined below is the Group share by segment Segment Group share Covent Garden 100% Earls Court Properties
63% Lillie Square 50% Empress State 100% Other 100%
Innova 50% GCP 50%
0% Other 100% 1 Venues was 100 per cent owned until 7 April 2017.
Subsequent to this the Group share ownership is nil.
Segmental reporting has been presented in line with management information and therefore consolidation adjustments are presented to reconcile segmental performance and position to the IFRS total.
The Groups operating segments derive their revenue primarily from rental income from lessees.
Unallocated expenses consist primarily of costs incurred centrally which are neither directly nor meaningfully attributable to individual segments.

The Lillie square joint venture incurs amortisation charges on deep discount bonds that were issued to the Group and Kwok Family Interests KFI which has contributed to the cumulative losses.
The Group has recognised 11.7 million 2016 10.5 million finance income on these deep discount bonds.
During the year the amounts receivable from joint ventures were part repaid resulting in a write back of 8.2 million against amounts previously impaired.
The impairment of amounts receivable from joint venture is calculated with reference to the Groups share of the cumulative losses in the Lillie Square joint venture.
The carrying value of the investment is nil 2016 nil in accordance with IAS 28 Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures IAS 28.
Refer to note 17 Investment in Joint Ventures.
Due to objective evidence existing an impairment assessment was performed in accordance with IAS 39 Financial instruments comparing the carrying amount of the deep discount bonds to the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
This has resulted in a write down of 9.5 million which has been recorded against the deep discount bonds.
6 OTHER COSTS On 30 August 2012 the Group completed a joint venture arrangement with KFI.
The venture to develop land interests at Lillie Square resulted in the loss of control of the former subsidiary Lillie Square GP Limited and the disposal of a 50 per cent limited partnership interest in Lillie Square LP.
As at 31 December 2016 additional costs associated with the transaction were incurred resulting in a loss of 5.0 million.

The disposal was in line with the Group strategy following the successful transition of shows from the former Earls Court Exhibition Centres to Olympia.
After the repayment of debt working capital adjustments and transaction related costs net proceeds received were 230.2 million.
Based on the net assets at the date of disposal a profit has been recognised on the sale of 2.1 million.
As part of the sale the defined benefit scheme the Group previous held was sold to the purchaser and therefore the Group has no outstanding liability in relation to the scheme.
The net assets at the date of disposal were as follows 7 April Investment and development property Other noncurrent assets Pension asset Cash and cash equivalents Other current assets Other current liabilities Deferred tax

Tradi ng property continues to be measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value in the consolidated financial statements.
Financial statements Strategic report Governance Capco Annual Report and Accounts 2017 118 Notes to the accounts continued 118 Capco Annual Report and Accounts 2017 15 PROPERTY PORTFOLIO CONTINUED At 31 December 2017 the Group was contractually committed to 57.3 million 2016 149.2 million of future expenditure for the purchase construction development and enhancement of investment development and trading property.
Refer to note 29 Capital Commitments for further information on capital commitments.
The fair value of the Groups investment development and trading property at 31 December 2017 was determined by independent appropriately qualified external valuers JLL for Earls Court Properties excluding the Empress State Building and 1517 Long Acre and CBRE Ltd for the remainder of the Groups property portfolio.
The valuations conform to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS Valuation Professional Standards.
Fees paid to valuers are based on fixed price contracts.
Each year the Executive Directors on behalf of the Board appoint the external valuers.
The valuers are selected based upon their knowledge independence and reputation for valuing assets such as those held by the Group.
Valuations are performed biannually and are performed consistently across all properties in the Groups portfolio.
At each reporting date appropriately qualified employees of the Group verify all significant inputs and review computational outputs.
Valuers submit and present summary reports to the Groups Audit Committee with the Executive Directors reporting to the Board on the outcome of each valuation round.
Valuations take into account tenure lease terms and structural condition.
The inputs underlying the valuations include market rent or business profitability likely incentives offered to tenants forecast growth rates yields EBITDA discount rates construction costs including any site specific costs for example Section 106 professional fees planning fees developers profit including contingencies planning and construction timelines lease regear costs planning risk and sales prices based on known market transactions for similar properties or properties similar to those contemplated for development.
As at 31 December 2017 all Covent Garden properties are valued under the income capitalisation technique.
The majority of Earls Court properties are valued under the residual development approach.
Valuations are based on what is determined to be the highest and best use.
When considering the highest and best use a valuer will consider on a property by property basis its actual and potential uses which are physically legally and financially viable.
Where the highest and best use differs from the existing use the valuer will consider the cost and the likelihood of achieving and implementing this change in arriving at its valuation.
A number of the Groups properties have been valued on the basis of their development potential which differs from their existing use.
In respect of development valuations the valuer ordinarily considers the gross development value of the completed scheme based upon assumptions of capital values rental values and yields of the properties which would be created through the implementation of the development.
Deductions are then made for anticipated costs including an allowance for developers profit before arriving at a valuation.
Most notably within Earls Court Properties the Empress State Building has been valued on the basis of its development potential as a residentialled scheme.
The property is currently used as an office space generating an income stream for the Group while the process to achieve the change in use is being implemented.
There are often restrictions on both freehold and leasehold property which could have a material impact on the realisation of these assets.
The most significant of these occur when planning permission is required or when a credit facility is in place.
These restrictions are factored into the propertys valuation by the external valuer.
Refer to disclosures surrounding property risks on page 19.
Nonfinancial assets carried at fair value as is the case for investment and development property held by the Group are required to be analysed by level depending on the valuation method adopted under IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement IFRS 13.
Trading property is exempt from IFRS 13 disclosure requirements.
The different valuation levels are defined as Level 1 valuation based on quoted market prices traded in active markets Level 2 valuation based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that maximise the use of observable data either directly or from market prices or indirectly derived from market prices and Level 3 where one or more inputs to valuation are not based on observable market data.
Valuations at this level are more subjective and therefore more closely managed including sensitivity analysis of inputs to valuation models.
When the degree of subjectivity or nature of the measurement inputs changes consideration is given as to whether a transfer between fair value levels is deemed to have occurred.
Unobservable data becoming observable market data would determine a transfer from Level 3 to Level 2.
All investment and development properties held by the Group are classified as Level 3.
As at 31 December 2016 178.5 million of Covent Garden investment and development properties were valued using the residual development method valuation technique.
As at 31 December 2017 these properties have been valued using the income capitalisation valuation technique as the developments have completed or are substantially complete.

Construction costs incl uding site specific costs expressed per square foot on a gross external area basis.
For properties valued under the income capitalisation method if all other factors remained equal an increase in estimated rental value of five per cent would result in an increased asset valuation of 119.5 million 2016 111.8 million.
A decrease in the estimated rental value of five per cent would result in a decreased asset value of 115.8 million 2016 108.7 million.
Conversely an increased equivalent yield of 25 basis points would result in a decreased asset valuation of 174.3 million 2016 159.8 million.
A decreased equivalent yield of 25 basis points would result in an increased asset valuation of 199.4 million 2016 182.9 million.
These inputs are interdependent partially determined by market conditions.
The impact on the valuation could be mitigated by the interrelationship between the two inputs.
An increase in estimated rental value occurring in conjunction with an increase in equivalent yield could result in no net impact to the valuation.
For properties valued under the residual development method an increase in the estimated construction costs of 10 per cent wou ld result in a decrease in the asset valuation of 224.5 million 2016 238.1 million and a decrease of 10 per cent would result in an inc rease in the asset valuation of 225.1 million 2016 239.4 million.
An increase in the developers profit of one percentage point would result in a decrease in the asset valuation of 24.8 million 2016 27.8 million and a decrease of one percentage point would result in an increase in the asset valuation of 24.8 million 2016 28.6 million.
An increased finance rate of 25 basis points would result in a decreased asset valuation of 25.2 million 2016 26.3 million and a decrease of 25 basis points would result in an incr eased asset valuation of 25.0 million 2016 26.6 million.
Conversely an increase in the capital value per square foot of five per cent would result in an increase in the asset valuatio n of 144.8 million 2016 158.1 million and a decrease of fi ve per cent would result in a decrease in the asset valuation of 145.8 million 201 6 156.4 million.
The above inputs are interdependent partially determined by market conditions.
The impact on the valuation could be mitigated by the interrelationship between these inputs.
An increase in the discount rate included in a discount cash flow valuation of 10 per cent would result in a decrease in the asset valuation of 0.2 million 2016 22.4 million.
A decrease in the discount rate included in a discount cash flow valuation of 10 per cent would result in an increase in the asset valuation of 0.2 million 2016 38.4 million.

Cash and undrawn committed facilities attributable to the Group at 31 December 2017 were 666.5 million 2016 563.6 million.
The fair values of the Groups borrowings have been estimated using the market value for floating rate borrowings which approximates nominal value and discounted cash flow approach for fixed rate borrowings representing Level 2 fair value measurements as defined by IFRS 13.
The different valuation levels are defined in note 15 Property Portfolio.

Certain leases provide for payment of contingent rent usually a proportion of net rental income in addition to the minimum lease payments above.
1.3 million contingent rent has been paid during the year 2016 1.1 million.
A 999 year leasehold interest is held for the air rights above the West London Line as detailed in note 30 Contingent Liabilities.
Any further payments payable at the time of development or disposal of each phase of the Earls Court Masterplan will be accounted for as contingent rent when incurred.
Finance lease liabilities are effectively secured obligations as the rights to the leased asset revert to the lessor in the event of default.

26 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Groups financial risk management strategy seeks to set financial limits for treasury activity to ensure they are in line with the risk appetite of the Group.
The Group is exposed to a variety of risks arising from the Groups operations market risk principally interest rate risk liquidity risk and credit risk.
The following tables set out each class of financial assets and financial liabilities as at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016.

The majority of the Groups financial risk management is carried out by Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
The policies for managing each of these risks and the principal effects of these policies on the results for the year are summa rised below.
Market risk Interest rate risk Interest rate risk comprises both cash flow and fair value risks.
Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.
Fair value risk is the risk that the fair value of financial instruments will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates.
The Groups interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at variable rates that expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk whereas borrowings issued at fixed interest rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
26 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED It is Group policy and often a requirement of our lenders to eliminate substantially all short and mediumterm exposure to interest rate fluctuations in order to establish certainty over mediumterm cash flows by using fixed interest rate derivatives.
Interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating to fixed rates.
Interest rate caps protect the Group by capping the maximum interest rate payable at the caps ceiling.
Interest rate collars protect the Group by capping the maximum interest rate payable at the collars ceiling but sacrifices the profitability of interest rate falls below a certain floor.
The table below shows the effects of derivative contracts that are linked to the drawn external borrowings profile of the Group and joint ventures.
The table is calculated on a Group share basis in line with the reporting of this information internally to management.
FixedCapped
Floating
FixedCapped

Group policy is to ensure that interest rate protection on Group external debt is greater than 25 per cent.
In 2016 the Group entered into a forward starting interest rate swap to hedge the variability in specified hedged interest cash flows arising on 60.0 million of outstanding debt from 2016 to 2026.
The loss recognised in other comprehensive income in the year was nil 2016 1.2 million.
This loss will be reclassified from other comprehensive income to the consolidated income statement over the term of the designated debt.
The fair value of the designated hedging instrument at 31 December 2017 is nil 2016 nil.
The hedge was 100 per cent effective therefore no charge for an ineffective portion has been taken to the consolidated income statement.
The sensitivity analysis below illustrates the impact of a 50 basis point bps shift upwards and downwards in the level of interest rates on the movement in fair value of derivative financial instruments.
Increase in interest rates by 50 bps Decrease in interest rates by 50 bps Increase in interest rates by 50 bps Decrease in interest rates by 50 bps Effect on profit before tax change in fair value of derivative financial instruments Increasedecrease 6.6 6.6 10.4 10.4 The sensitivity analysis above is a reasonable illustration of the possible effect from the changes in slope and shifts in the yield curve that may actually occur and represents managements assessment of possible changes in interest rates.
The fixed rate derivative financial instruments are matched by floating rate debt therefore such a movement would have a very limited effect on Group cash flow overall.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is managed to ensure that the Group is able to meet future payment obligations when financial liabilities fall due.
The Groups policy is to seek to minimise its exposure to liquidity risk by managing its exposure to interest rate risk and to refinancing risk.
The Group seeks to borrow for as long as possible at the lowest cost.
Liquidity analysis is intended to provide sufficient headroom to meet the Groups operational requirements and investment commi tments.
The Groups policy also includes maintaining adequate cash as well as maintaining adequate committed and undrawn facilities.
A key factor in ensuring existing facilities remain available to the Group is the borrowing entitys ability to meet the relevant facilitys financial covenants.
The Group has a process to monitor regularly both current and projected compliance with the financial covenants.
The Group regularly reviews the maturity profile of its financial liabilities and will seek to avoid concentrations of maturities through the regular replacement of facilities and by staggering maturity dates.
Refinancing risk may be reduced by reborrowing prior to the contracted maturity date effectively switching liquidity risk for market risk.
This is subject to credit facilities being available at the time of the desired refinancing.
The tables overleaf set out the maturity analysis of the Groups financial liabilities based on the undiscounted contractual obligations to make payments of interest and to repay principal.
Where interest payment obligations are based on a floating rate the rates used are those implied by the par yield curve.

Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are trade and other receivables amounts receivable from joint ventures loan notes and cash and cash equivalents.
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a tenant or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract.
Credit risk arises primarily from trade receivables relating to tenants but also from the Groups undrawn commitments and holdings of assets such as cash deposits and loans with financial counterparties.
The carrying value of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk without taking into account the value of any deposits or guarantees obtained.
Trade and other receivables Credit risk associated with trade receivables is actively managed tenants are managed individually by asset managers who cont inuously monitor and work with tenants anticipating and wherever possible identifying and addressing risks prior to default.
Trade receivables are less than one per cent of total assets at 31 December 2017 2016 less than one per cent.
Prospective tenants are assessed through an internally conducted review process by obtaining credit ratings and reviewing financial information.
As a result deposits or guarantees may be obtained.
The amount of deposits held as collateral at 31 December 2017 was 13.6 million 2016 7.8 million.
Due to the nature of tenants being managed individually by asset managers it is Group policy to calculate any impairment specifically on each contract.
Specific provisions are made for trade receivables less than 90 days where active credit control highlights recoverability concerns.
The amounts of trade receivables presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
The ageing analysis of these trade receivables past due but not impaired is as follows
Group
Up to 90 days 3.2 7.3 Over 90 days 0.1 0.6 Trade receivables 3.3 7.9 In 2017 there was an impairment write back on trade receivables of 0.5 million 2016 write down of 0.6 million.
As the Group operates predominantly in central London it is subject to some geographical risk.
However this is mitigated by the extensive range of tenants from varying business sectors and the credit review process as noted above.
26 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Amounts receivable from joint ventures Included within receivables is nil 2016 7.0 million of amou nts advanced to LSJV.
The carrying value of the investment in LSJV is nil 2016 nil as the Groups share of losses exceeds the cost of its investment.
Total funding advanced to LSJV including the deep discount bonds of 147.5 million 2016 150.9 million has been impaired by the cumulative losses attributable to the joint venture by 47.6 million 2016 46.3 million.
LSJV is in a net liability position due to carrying trading property at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
However based on a market valuation undertaken by the Groups valuers JLL there is an unrecognised surplus of 31.8 million Group share as at 31 December 2017.
This surplus will only be evidenced on sale of trading property when significant risks and rewards have transferred to the buyer.
Therefore while Lillie Square demonstrates positive pricing evidence commercially and funding provided is not deemed to be at risk of default for reporting purposes the Group is required to allocate losses against amounts advanced to LSJV to the extent that losses do not exceed the investment until the unrecognised surplus on trading property is realised through sale.
Cash deposits and derivative financial instruments The credit risk relating to cash deposits and derivative financial instruments is actively managed by Group Treasury.
Relationships are maintained with a number of institutional counterparties ensuring compliance with Group cash investment policy relating to limits on the credit ratings of counterparties.
The maximum exposure to cash deposits and derivative financial instruments as at 31 December 2017 amounted to 28.6 million 2016 31.1 million.
Capital structure The Group seeks to enhance shareholder value both by investing in the business so as to improve the return on investment and by managing the capital structure.
The Group uses a mix of equity debt and other financial instruments and aims to access both debt and equity capital markets with maximum efficiency and flexibility.
The key ratios used to monitor the capital structure of the Group are the loan to value ratio LTV and the interest cover ratio.
The Group aims not to exceed an underlying LTV ratio of more than 40 per cent and to maintain interest cover above 125 per cent.
These ratios are disclosed on a Group share basis in line with the reporting of this information internally to management.
These metrics are discussed in the Financial Review on page 40.

Fair value estimation Financial instruments carried at fair value are required to be analysed by level depending on the valuation method adopted under IFRS 13.
The different valuation levels are defined in note 15 Property Portfolio.
The tables below present the Groups financial assets and liabilities recognised at fair value at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016.
There were no transfers between levels during the year.

The fair values of the Groups cash and cash equivalents other financial assets and other financial liabilities are not materially different from those at which they are carried in the financial statements.
Financial statements Strategic report Governance Capco Annual Report and Accounts 2017 130 Notes to the accounts continued 130 Capco Annual Report and Accounts 2017 27 DEFERRED TAX The decrease in corporation tax rate referred to in note 11 Taxation has been enacted for the purposes of IAS 12 Income Taxes IAS 12 and therefore has been reflected in these consolidated financial statements based on the expected timing of the realisation of deferred tax.
Deferred tax on investment and development property is calculated under IAS 12 provisions on a disposals basis by reference to the properties original tax base cost.
Elements factored into the calculation include indexation relief and the Groups holding structure.
The Groups recognised deferred tax position on investment and development property as calculated under IAS 12 is nil at 31 December 2017 2016 nil.
The Groups contingent tax liability on investment properties calculated on the same tax base cost as above but based on a deemed market value disposal at year end is nil 2016 nil.
A disposal of the Groups trading properties at their market value as per note 15 Property Portfolio net of available losses would result in a corporation tax charge to the Group of 1.6 million 19.25 per cent of 8.3 million.

In November 2013 the Group exercised its option under the CLSA which it entered into with LBHF in January 2013 in relation to LBHFs land interest within the Earls Court Masterplan.
Under the terms of the CLSA the Group can draw down land in phases but no land can be transferred unless replacement homes for the residents of the relevant phase have been provided and vacant possession is given.
The Group has already paid 75.0 million of the 105.0 million cash consideration payable under the CLSA.
The residual 30.0 million will be settled in two annual instalments of 15.0 million with the next payment due on 31 December 2018.
The Groups share of joint venture capital commitments arising on LSJV amounts to 7.0 million 2016 18.2 million.
30 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES The Group has contingent liabilities in respect of legal claims guarantees and warranties arising from the ordinary course of business.
Contingent liabilities that may result in material liabilities are described below.
Under the terms of the CLSA the Group has certain compensation obligations relating to achieving vacant possession which are subject to an overall cap of 55.0 million.
Should any payments be made in respect of these obligations they will be deducted from the total consideration payable to LBHF refer to note 29 Capital Commitments.
In March 2013 an agreement with Network Rail was signed to acquire a 999 year leasehold interest in the air rights above the West London Line where it runs within the Earls Court and West Kensington Opportunity Area.
Within the terms of the agreement the Group can exercise options during the next 50 years for further 999 year leases over the remainder of the West London Line to allow for development within the Earls Court Masterplan.
Network Rail is entitled to further payments of 5.55 per cent of the residual land value which will be payable at the time of development or disposal of each phase of the Earls Court Masterplan.
Any further payments to Network Rail will be treated as contingent rent as per note 24 Finance Lease Obligations.
Within the terms of the agreement of the acquisition of the Northern Access Road land the vendors successor in title is entitled to further payments until 2027 if certain conditions are met.
Further payments become due following the grant of a planning permission for change of use or on disposal.
In the event such planning permission is implemented the payment is calculated at 50 per cent of the uplift in land value following the grant of the permission.
In the event of a disposal the payment is calculated as 50 per cent of the difference between the sale value against the land value without the relevant permission.

Alternative performance measures For the year ended 31 December 2017 The Group has applied the European Securities and Markets Authority ESMA guidelines on alternative performance measures APMs in these annual results.
An APM is a financial measure of historical or future finance performance position or cash flow of the Group which is not a measure defined or specified in IFRS.
Set out below is a summary of the APMs used in this Annual Report.
Many of the APMs included are based on the EPRA Best Practice Recommendations reporting framework a set of standard disclosures for the property industry which aims to improve the transparency comparability and relevance of published results of public real estate companies in Europe.
The Group also uses underlying earnings property portfolio and financial debt ratios APMs.
The Group considers the presentation of underlying earnings to be useful supplementary information as it removes unrealised and certain other items and therefore represents the recurring underlying performance of the business.
The property portfolio presents the Group share of property market value which is the economic value attributable to the owners of the Parent.
Financial debt ratios are supplementary ratios which we believe are useful in monitoring the capital structure of the Group.
Additionally loan to value and interest cover are covenants within many of the Groups borrowing facilities.
Internally the Board focuses on and reviews information and reports prepared on a Group share basis which includes the Groups share of joint ventures but excludes the noncontrolling interest share of our subsidiaries.
