AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Strategic priority What we said What we did
More than 3D AVEVAs core sales are in the area of 3D Plant and Marine design.
We aim to grow sales of other design tools such as AVEVA Electrical AVEVA Engineering and information management tools such as AVEVA NET to address the whole life cycle of industrial assets.
We see a major market opportunity in leveraging our customer base by selling additional engineering software tools outside of AVEVAs core 3D design platforms.
We grew MT3D sales strongly during the year with an increase of 2.1% on a constant currency basis.
Sales of our wider product suite have been a feature of this years key customer wins with for example the AVEVA NET and AVEVA Engage information management tools helping to strengthen our offer to OOs.
26 % Revenues from MT3D in 2017
OPERATORS
OOs such as energy and power generation companies currently account for only 16% of our revenue.
A significant market opportunity is developing as OOs increasingly adopt Digital Assets to help them manage their physical assets throughout their life cycles.
AVEVAs sales to OOs also grew strongly during the year increasing 5.4% on a constant currency basis.
We won some impressive new customer logos from our competitors during the year which demonstrates the strength of our technology offering for OOs.
16 % Revenues from Owner Operators in 2017
MARKETS
AVEVA generates almost 50% of its revenue from EMEA.
This largely reflects our heritage as a UKbased company and indicates an opportunity to take a larger share of the global market.
We intend to grow our revenues in key markets such as the USA the Middle East and China using the competitive advantages that our products offer.
AVEVA performed well in our target growth markets during the year.
We enjoyed success in North America where our local strategy of leading with sales to OOs and of MT3D products is working well and resulted in key new customer wins including Southern Company and one of the worlds leading industrial conglomerates.
Although we continue to see growth potential in China our business there performed less well during the year while achieving a solid performance in the Middle East.
18.9% Constant currency revenue growth in North America
MARKET
EXPOSURE
AVEVAs core heritage is Oil and Gas and particularly upstream offshore.
However our technology is well suited to a wide range of industries offering exciting growth opportunities.
We aim to grow our market share in industries beyond our core Oil and Gas and Marine markets.
We achieved key new customer wins in the Power market.
We grew revenues from Fabrication strongly.
10.0% Constant currency increase in steel fabrication revenue in 2017 SAAS AND THE CLOUD We intend to unify all of our applications onto a common Cloud platform to enhance ease of customer adoption and address a wider customer base.
While AVEVAs business model already has the high level of recurring subscription revenues typically associated with Cloud delivery we aim to be technologically ready to offer our products on a SaaS model in response to customer demand.
We launched our first public Cloud products AVEVA Connect and AVEVA NET Connect at the AVEVA World Summit in October 2016.
We will soon be launching our Information Standards Management ISM software in the Cloud.
77 % AVEVAs recurring revenues in 2017 STRA TEGIC FRAMEWORK NOTWITHSTANDING THE CYCLICAL HEADWINDS IN END MARKETS THAT AVEVA HAS EXPERIENCED IN THE RECENT PAST  WE EXPECT OUR STRATEGY TO DELIVER SOLID ORGANIC GROWTH INTO THE LONG TERM.
Our strategy is to increase revenues by expanding the addressable market as the concept of the Digital Asset is more widely adopted to sell a wider range of products and to grow in industry and geographic verticals where the Group s market share is underweight versus the strength of its product offering.
This strategy is organised around the pillars shown opposite of More than 3D Owner Operators Growth Markets Broadening Market Exposure and Software as a Service SaaS and the Cloud.
Link to KPIs Our success in executing our strategy ultimately feeds into our KPIs see page 21 which track our longterm aim of delivering sustainable profitable growth.

77 % AVEVAs recurring revenues in 2017 AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 CHAIRMANS ST A TEMENT AVEVA DELIVERED A RESILIENT PERFORMANCE DURING THE YEAR.
WE WILL CONTINUE TO TARGET GROWTH STRENGTHENING CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS WINNING NEW CUSTOMERS AND DEVELOPING OUR PRODUCT PORTFOLIO.
I am pleased to report that AVEVA delivered a resilient performance during 201617  despite two of our key end markets Oil and Gas and Marine remaining subdued.
Revenue increased 7 .1% to 215.8 million 2016  201.5 million assisted by currency translation and profit before tax was 46.9 million 2016  29.4 million supported by strong cost discipline.
On an adjusted basis profit before tax grew 7 .4% to 55.0 million 2016  51.2 million.
The Group also increased cash from operating activities by 58.2% to 57 .2 million 2016  36.1 million.
We are maintaining our progressive dividend policy and propose to increase the total dividend for the year to 40.0 pence per share 2016 36.0 pence.
This represents an increase of 11.1% over the prior year underpinned by our confidence in the longterm prospects for the business.
AVEVAs net cash position at the year end grew to 130.9 million 2016  107 .9 million.
The Board believes that it is important to maintain a strong balance sheet.
This gives our customers confidence in the strength of our business and allows us to have at hand sufficient resources to invest in AVEVAs future growth for example by investing in Research and Development and capitalising on acquisition opportunities as they become available.
Delivering on our strategy In addition to delivering solid results we have remained focused on executing upon our strategy in order to position AVEVA to achieve growth well into the future.
AVEVA achieved good momentum in sales of products beyond the core 3D design software that currently makes up the majority of our revenue.
We also made good progress with our strategy of increasing our sales to Owner Operators OOs growth in the key North American market and in broadening our market exposure outside of Oil and Gas and Marine.
For example during the year we had considerable success in the Power market winning contracts with companies including KEPCO EandC Southern Company and TerraPower.
These successes were made possible by the strength of our technologies and people.
We continued to enhance our existing products and develop new offerings during the year through our development centres in Cambridge and Hyderabad.
Board developments At the end of 2016 after 33 years with the Group and 17 years as Chief Executive Richard Longdon stepped down from his role as Chief Executive and as a Director of the Company.
Richard oversaw the most successful phase in AVEVAs history and was the driving force in developing it into a global company.
The Board and I are grateful to Richard for his contribution to AVEVAs success.

We were also pleased to appoint David Ward to the Board as James successor in the role of Chief Financial Officer in July.
David had been Head of Finance at AVEVA since 2011.
James and David were both key to developing AVEVAs strategy and I have been impressed with the sharp focus that they have demonstrated in executing it in their new roles.
We also had changes within our Non Executive team.
Jonathan Brooks and Philip Dayer both reached their nine year tenures during the year.
Jonathan stepped down from the Board in November 2016 and Philip will retire at the AGM in July 2017 .
I would like to thank them both on behalf of the Board for their contributions to AVEVA.
We welcomed two new NonExecutives to the Board.
Christopher Humphrey joined the Board in July 2016 and assumed the role of Chair of the Audit Committee in November.
Rohinton
Ron Mobed was appointed to the Board in March 2017 .
Christopher and Ron have a wealth of technology and information management experience which will add further breadth and depth to the skills of the Board.
Summary
AVEVA is now in its 50th year having been founded in 1967 as a government funded research institute created by the then UK Ministry of Technology at Cambridge University.
The Companys original mission to develop computer aided design techniques for use by British industry has been achieved and indeed greatly exceeded.
The Group now operates in more than 30 countries across the globe and provides the design technology that has created some of the worlds largest and most complex engineering assets.
As I look ahead the opportunities are as exciting as they have ever been as industries look to drive efficiencies by adopting a Digital Asset approach throughout the life cycle of the physical asset.
We will continue to target growth strengthening customer relationships winning new customers in new areas and developing our product portfolio.
AVEVAs progress would not be possible without the hard work and dedication of all our employees.
The Board would like to express its sincere thanks for their considerable efforts.
We would also like to thank our customers shareholders and other stakeholders for their continued support.

23 May 2017 AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Oil and Gas MARKET REVIEW AVEVAS KEY END MARKETS ARE OIL and GAS MARINE POWER AND PETROCHEMICAL and CHEMICAL.
OTHER MARKETS WE SERVE INCLUDE FABRICATION PAPER and PULP  MINING AND PHARMACEUTICALS.
OIL and GAS ACCOUNTS FOR APPROXIMATEL Y 4045% OF REVENUE MARINE 20% POWER 1520% PETROCHEMICAL and CHEMICAL 10% AND THE REMAINDER 10%.
Oil and Gas Oil and Gas industry endmarket demand was weak with global industry capital expenditure falling by over 40% between calendar 2014 and calendar 2016.
Sources Barclays Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
This decline had a significant impact on the workloads of our EPC customers with the more complex and therefore designintensive upstream and offshore projects being impacted the most by lower oil prices.
This in turn led to some consolidation in our customer base.
These developments impacted demand for our software.
EPC customers tend to favour a rental model for software meaning that their spend with AVEVA adjusts to market demand relatively quickly.
The oil price did however rise towards the end of calendar 2016 helping to underpin a view that industry capital expenditure might start to recover in calendar 2017 .
Over time the industries that we serve are growing although Oil and Gas and Marine have historically seen substantial cyclical peaks and troughs in capital spend.
We aim to outperform the endmarket growth of the industries that we serve as technology particularly the concept of the Digital Asset is more widely adopted throughout the life cycles of physical assets.
In time this will grow the addressable market.
Marine
The Marine market also experienced very weak demand during our 2017 financial year.
New ship orders were more than halved in calendar 2016 versus 2015 Source Clarksons
Notwithstanding this AVEVAs performance was resilient.
We have strong longterm relationships with our customers with nine out of ten of the worlds leading shipyards choosing AVEVA products.
These yards have mostly maintained their software licences during the cyclical downturn in the expectation of a recovery in future years.
Clarksons Research forecasts a recovery in new ship orders globally with strong annual growth off the low calendar year 2016 base out to 2020.

CHIEF EXECUTIVES STRA TEGIC REVIEW
WHILST CONDITIONS REMAIN CHALLENGING IN OUR CORE OIL and GAS AND MARINE MARKETS OUR BUSINESS HAS SEEN EXCELLENT SUCCESSES IN OUR KEY GROWTH INDUSTRIES.
As expected AVEVAs financial performance was resilient despite the challenging conditions in our core end markets.
In addition to delivering solid results we made good progress in delivering against our strategy during the year and in structuring the business to enable future growth.
Revenue increased 7 .1% to 215.8 million 2016 201.5 million assisted by a currency translation benefit of 11.4%.
Profit before tax grew to 46.9 million 2016 29.4 million supported by a strong focus on cost control.
On an adjusted basis profit before tax grew 7 .4% to 55.0 million 2016  51.2 million.
On a regional basis revenue in the Americas grew due to a strong performance in North America partly offset by difficult market conditions in Latin America specifically in Brazil.
AVEVAs performance in EMEA and Asia Pacific was robust in the context of the subdued Oil and Gas and Marine markets.
Overall Group revenue declined in constant currency terms by 3.8% although we did see an improvement in the second half.
Excluding Latin America Group revenue declined only 2.3% in constant currency terms for the full year and was flat in the second half.
We made good progress in executing our strategy.
On a constant currency basis we delivered good growth with More Than 3D MT3D Owner Operators and sales to the Power sector.
The strength of our product offering was demonstrated by several key new business wins during the year.
These included wins in both markets that offer growth opportunities for us and in our more mature product and geographic areas.
During the year I took over as CEO and David Ward transitioned to the post of
We have both been in the business for many years and were core to formulating AVEVAs strategy.
We plan to continue to pursue this strategy with a sharp focus on execution and getting closer to our customers.
As part of this I have simplified AVEVAs management structure with greater decisionmaking capabilities and direct accountability for performance being allocated to our regions.
I have also added more customerfacing people to our Executive team including a recently recruited Chief Revenue Officer who will take overall responsibility for leading Global Sales Partnership Management and Marketing.

WE MADE GOOD PROGRESS IN DELIVERING AGAINST OUR STRATEGY DURING THE YEAR AND IN STRUCTURING THE BUSINESS TO ENABLE FUTURE GROWTH 11 .4 % Constant currency growth in Power revenue 5.4 % Constant currency growth in Owner Operator revenue STRATEGIC REPORT STRATEGIC REPORT Delivery against our strategy AVEVAs strategy is to increase revenues by growing the addressable market for its products as the concept of the Digital Asset is more widely adopted to sell a wider range of products and to grow in industry and geographic verticals where the Groups market share is underweight versus the strength of its product offering.
Notwithstanding the cyclical headwinds in end markets that AVEVA has experienced in the recent past we expect our strategy to deliver solid organic growth in the long term across end market cycles.
The building blocks of this strategy are as follows.
More than 3D We see a major market opportunity in leveraging our customer base and market position by selling additional engineering software tools extending beyond our core 3D design platforms.
Further to this information management tools such as AVEVA NET can generate revenue throughout the operation life cycle of assets therefore expanding the market that we address.
Owner Operators OOs such as energy and power generation companies currently only account for approximately 16% of our revenue.
However a significant market opportunity is developing as OOs increasingly adopt the Digital Asset concept to help them manage their physical assets throughout their life cycles.
Growth markets AVEVA generates approximately half of its revenue from EMEA.
This largely relates to our heritage as a UKbased company.
Over time we intend to grow our revenues in key markets such as the USA and China using the competitive advantages that our products offer.
Broaden market exposure We aim to grow our market share in industries beyond our core Oil and Gas and Marine markets with a particular focus in the short term on Power by applying the strength of our core technology and the rich knowledge of our people in these markets.
Software as a Service SaaS and the Cloud We intend to unify all of our applications onto a common Cloud platform to provide greater value to our customers and address a wider customer base.
CASE STUDY GROWTH MARKETS AVEVA is an established global company with 50 offices in 30 countries.
As such we can provide customers with local sales and support in all of the worlds major economies.
Notwithstanding this AVEVA was not the first mover in some of the worlds key growth markets and therefore has underweight positions due to the stickiness of customers to incumbent providers.
We believe that our products offer a strong advantage over competing offerings due to their inherent integration based on our leading objectmodelling technology which reduces complexity and lowers the total cost of ownership for our customers.
Our strategy is therefore to apply our competitive advantage to gain share in key target markets.
We are enjoying considerable success in North America where our strategy of leading with sales to Owner Operators often with innovative MT3D product offerings is delivering strong results.
18.9% AVEVAs constant currency growth in North America KEY GROWTH MARKET SUCCESSES DURING THE YEAR INCLUDED EXPANDING OUR BUSINESS WITH SOUTHERN COMPANY IN THE USA AND SINOPEC ENGINEERING GROUP IN CHINA.

CHIEF EXECUTIVES STRATEGIC REVIEW CONTINUED
More than 3D MT3D AVEVAs MT3D sales grew during the year increasing 2.1% on a constant currency basis.
MT3D products represented 26.5% of total revenue increasing from 25.2% in the prior year.
Sales of our wider product suite have been a feature of this years key customer wins with for example the AVEVA NET and AVEVA Engage information management tools helping to strengthen our offer to OOs.
We are also achieving success in leveraging our existing EPC Engineering Procurement and Construction customer base to sell MT3D products.
We have developed our technology to help deliver Building Information Management BIM projects in Infrastructure not only to help satisfy any BIM mandate but also to support faster more effective project execution and handover through improved data management.
A good example is Jacobs who have used AVEVA technologies AVEVA NET AVEVA Engineering and AVEVA Information Standards Manager to meet their clients information management and BIM level 2 requirements and to achieve efficiency improvements for a UK highways project.
Owner Operators AVEVAs sales to OOs also grew during the year increasing 5.4% on a constant currency basis.
OOs represented 16.2% of total revenue increasing from 14.9% in the prior year.
We had particular success in North America and Asia where we won contracts in the Petrochemical and Chemical and Power sectors.
These included KEPCO EandC a leading global energy solutions provider based in South Korea which chose AVEVA for a full range of 3D and MT3D design and information management products for its new nuclear power plant projects.
Similarly another leading power generation OO Southern Company in the USA selected our design and information management tools to help improve project execution efficiency and asset information access.
Meanwhile we strengthened our relationship with Eastman a global speciality chemical company.
Growth markets We enjoyed success in North America where our local strategy of leading with sales to OOs and of MT3D products is working well and we achieved significant new business wins.
The business grew by 18.9% during the year on a constant currency basis.
We continue to see growth potential in China where successes during the year included expanding our business with Sinopec Engineering Group which adopted AVEVAs Integrated Engineering and Design solution for effective design collaboration and improved efficiency.
However overall our business there was broadly flat during the year being impacted by tougher market conditions particularly in shipbuilding.
Broaden market exposure We made good progress during the year in broadening our market exposure away from the cyclical Oil and Gas and Marine end markets.
We enjoyed particular success in Power where revenue increased 11.4% on a constant currency basis during the year.
Our
During the year we achieved several key wins within the Power market with Southern Company and TerraPower in the USA KEPCO EPC in Korea and Japan Nuclear Fuel.
We also achieved success in Paper and Pulp where Valmet the leading global developer and supplier of technologies automation and services for the pulp paper and energy industries signed a multiyear agreement for AVEVA E3D.
AVEVA also enjoyed success in the steel fabrication market where sales increased by 10.0% on a constant currency basis as we continue to integrate and leverage the Bocad and FabTrol acquisitions.
STRATEGIC REPORT ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS WE DELIVERED GOOD GROWTH WITH MORE THAN 3D MT3D OOs AND SALES TO THE POWER SECTOR SaaS and the Cloud While AVEVAs business model already has the high level of recurring subscription revenues typically associated with Cloud delivery we aim to be technologically ready to offer our products on a SaaS model in response to customer demand.
For the industries we serve there are several challenges facing our customers which need to be overcome before there is a full transition to
However over time we do expect that customers will want to explore ways of using the Cloud to drive efficiency and improve collaboration through the supply chain and operating cycle of their assets.
We launched our Cloud platform AVEVA Connect together with our first SaaS offering Asset Visualisation at the AVEVA World Summit in October 2016.
AVEVA Connect is our SaaS ecosystem for Engineering Design and Information Management solutions.
Asset Visualisation is our new Information Management as a Service offering.
There is a willingness from the OOs to move towards SaaS for the provision of the Digital Asset and we expect these products to gain traction with major customers in the medium term.
In April this year we launched a second SaaS offering on AVEVA Connect Information Standards Management.
The Sales team has now been equipped to sell these solutions and we have brought on board several major oil Owner Operators as early adopters.
Both Asset Visualisation and Information Standards Management provide entry points for our Owner Operator customers to access Digital AssetasaService solutions flexibly and cost effectively.
Our technology Our software is used by customers as they design build and operate large capitalintensive assets mainly in the Process Power and Marine industries.
Our vision is for the widespread adoption of constantly evolving Digital Assets enabling our customers to manage continual change as they design build and operate some of the worlds most complicated physical assets.
We believe that our products offer a strong advantage over competing offerings due to their inherent integration based on our leading object modelling technology which reduces complexity and lowers the total cost of ownership for our customers.
AVEVAs heritage is in 3D design where our core products are AVEVA PDMS Plant Design Management System AVEVA E3D and AVEVA Marine products.
These products represented 73.5% of 201617 revenues.
AVEVA E3D is the latest generation 3D product which carries a price premium reflecting its higher productivity and advanced feature set.
AVEVA E3D grew strongly during the year as existing customers continued to migrate towards it and new contracts were won.
It contributed almost 13% of total revenue up from below 10% in the prior year.
Within More than 3D the largest product sets are schematics applications such as Piping and Instrumentation Diagram PandID Instrumentation and Electrical applications and our unique multi discipline AVEVA Engineering solution together with information management applications such as AVEVA NET.
These areas grew during the year with strong growth in information management sales particularly to the Owner Operators.

CHIEF EXECUTIVES STRATEGIC REVIEW CONTINUED
Our markets and our customers AVEVAs key end markets are Oil and Gas Marine Power and Petrochemical and Chemical.
Other
Construction and Steel Fabrication Mining and Minerals Processing Paper and Pulp and Pharmaceuticals.
Oil and Gas accounts for 4045% of revenue Marine 20% Power 1520% Petrochemical and Chemical 10% and the remainder 10%.
AVEVA has four main groups of customers.
These are EPCs shipyards OOs and Fabricators.
EPCs primarily use AVEVAs software to design and build industrial assets such as oil platforms power stations and process plants for OOs.
Demand from EPCs for AVEVAs products is therefore impacted by end market demand and particularly the level of capital expenditure on new installations and brownfield projects.
AVEVA has strong longstanding relationships with many leading EPCs.
The large global EPCs are managed as strategic partnerships through AVEVAs Global Accounts programme.
OOs are key to achieving AVEVAs vision of a constantlyevolving Digital Asset.
Whereas historically the Digital Asset was core only to the design phase of physical assets it is now widely accepted that Digital Assets can help OOs to drive efficiency and reduce risk through minimising downtime and unplanned outages while complying with ever more stringent environmental and safety legislation.
We won 9 new OO customers during the year and significantly expanded our business with several existing OO customers.
Oil and Gas In the Oil and Gas industry endmarket demand was weak with global industry capital expenditure falling by over 40% between calendar 2014 and calendar 2016 Sources Barclays Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
This decline had a significant impact on the workloads of our EPC customers with the more complex and therefore designintensive greenfield upstream and offshore projects being impacted most significantly.
This impacted demand for our software.
EPC customers tend to favour a rental model for software meaning that their spend with AVEVA adjusts to market demand relatively quickly and some EPCs have reduced their seat count reflecting lower activity.
There was also some consolidation amongst EPCs and in the oil services sector more generally.
However as OOs seek to extend the life of existing assets we saw an increase in revamps and modifications known as brownfield projects which helped to sustain a level of demand from EPCs although these projects are typically shorter in duration and lower in value.
Due to the downturn in the Oil and Gas industry OOs are putting pressure on EPCs to reduce the cost of capital projects often by up to 50%.
This is putting pressure on the margins of the EPCs and they have been forced to look at how they become more efficient and reduce the cost of projects.
EPCs are also increasingly looking to technology to help drive efficiency in projects.
Our integrated engineering and design approach which helps manage the engineering data across the different engineering disciplines is receiving very positive feedback enabling customers to reduce the total cost of ownership compared to our competition.
An area of focus for EPCs has been around reducing the cost of supporting maintaining and developing inhouse systems by looking to thirdparty vendors such as AVEVA to replace these with commercial software products.
STRATEGIC REPORT This is particularly pronounced around materials procurement and construction management given that many still use inhouse systems in these areas.
As such we are seeing significant interest in our Enterprise Resource Management product.
We are also seeing EPCs start to consider standardising their engineering technology strategy on one toolset and we believe that we are well positioned to capitalise on that trend.
Oil and Gas industry capital expenditure is forecast to increase in future years as investments are made to maintain production and reserves.
There are early signs of improvement in the market however the exact timing of a market recovery is difficult to predict.
Marine
AVEVA is a market leader in Marine design software with customers including 90% of the worlds largest shipyards.
The Marine market is in a cyclical trough with a relatively low number of new ship builds ongoing.
Shipyard customers typically prefer an Initial Licence Fee model because they view software as a longerterm investment rather than being project specific.
This results in annual maintenance payments continuing even in tougher market conditions.
Our recurring revenue from the Marine market was broadly flat during the year.
We are also winning significant new business in the sector with new wins in Europe including a customer focused on cruise ships and in Asia where we won a major South East Asian customer focused on Marine and offshore capital projects.
As with Oil and Gas the Marine market is forecast by commentators such as Clarksons Research to recover from the current trough conditions.
We expect activity to increase as overcapacity in the world fleet reduces and demand for specialist ships such as Floating Production Storage and Offloading vessels and naval vessels grows although again the exact timing of a market recovery is difficult to predict.
CASE STUDY
MARKET EXPOSURE AVEVA has a high proportion of recurring revenues at 76.9% in 201617 due to our righttouse licensing model.
Notwithstanding this resilience some 65% of our revenues are generated in the Oil and Gas and Marine markets.
To an extent therefore the Groups growth prospects have historically been materially influenced by end market conditions within these markets e. operated.
Both Oil and Gas and Marine have grown over the long term but have been subject to shortterm cyclicality.
As such our strategy is to broaden our exposure to other industries which are growing offering the opportunity to achieve market share gains in areas that are less cyclical than our core markets.
Our focus in 201617 was on obtaining share gains in the Power industry.
We achieved great success in this endeavour developing our business with multiple OO customers as well as with companies involved in the design and production of generation technology.
11.4% AVEVAs constant currency growth in the Power sector KEY SUCCESSES IN BROADENING OUR MARKET EXPOSURE DURING THE YEAR INCLUDED NEW ORDER WINS AND EXPANDING OUR BUSINESS WITH JAPAN NUCLEAR FUEL KEPCO EandC SOUTHERN COMPANY TERRAPOWER AND VALMET .

Power
We had significant success in the Power market during the year winning several new contracts with both utilities and power systems design companies.
Longerterm trends in the Power market are positive as the worlds emerging economies invest in their power generation requirements and the ageing infrastructure of the developed world is maintained and replaced.
In the shorter term AVEVA benefited from market share gains and requirements from operators in the sector for both design and information management tools as they seek to improve asset efficiency.
Petrochemical and Chemical We saw ongoing investment in the sector during the year particularly in Asia with stable market conditions on a global basis.
AVEVA enjoyed success in winning new OO customers in Asia during the year in the refining sector.
Other markets Conditions in AVEVAs other markets are less subject to cyclical volatility meaning that AVEVA can grow in a more linear fashion through the execution of its strategy.
Notable developments during the year included solid constant currency growth in sales to fabricators and a new OO customer win in the Pharmaceutical sector.
In the Fabrication sector AVEVA provides integrated endtoend solutions for 3D modelling detailing and fabrication of structural steelwork.
This enables rapid highquality fabrication and construction for ontime onbudget integrated project execution for customers specialising in the engineering manufacturing and assembly of advanced steel structures.
In 201617 our revenue from Fabricator customers increased 10.0% on a constant currency basis.
Outlook
We believe that AVEVA has both the market opportunity and the right strategy to deliver substantial growth over the longer term.
In the short term demand cycles within our end markets have had an impact on growth.
Our core markets of Oil and Gas and Marine which together account for over 60% of Group revenue have been in a cyclical trough over the last three years.
There are early signs of improvement in Oil and Gas.
Although the timing of a full recovery in demand is still uncertain we expect that as the headwinds lessen the growth resulting from our strategic initiatives will begin to show at the Group level.
The Board remains confident in the longterm strength of AVEVAs business model the deliverability of its organic growth strategy and its positioning to benefit from a recovery in our end markets.

Overview
50 years of innovation have produced industryleading software that is used by our customers to create Digital Assets that allow them to manage continual change as they design build and operate some of the worlds most complicated physical assets.
As technology evolves with ever greater processing power connectivity mobility of computing platforms and the Industrial Internet of Things our vision for the widespread adoption of constantlyevolving Digital Assets is becoming ever more compelling.
We believe that our products offer a strong advantage over competing offerings.
This is due to their inherent integration based on our leading objectmodelling technology which reduces complexity and lowers the total cost of ownership for our customers.
In an increasingly connected world openness to access information sources either third party or customer owned is proving businesscritical to our customers.
Supporting our strategy AVEVAs strategy is to increase revenues by growing the addressable market as the concept of the Digital Asset is more widely adopted to sell a wider range of products and to grow in industry and geographic verticals where the Groups market share is underweight versus the strength of its product offering.
We are continually developing our technology to support this strategy and at the same time accommodating the needs of customers in what are inherently safety first industries for application and data continuity.
Our heritage is in 3D design where our core products are AVEVA PDMS AVEVA Everything3D AVEVA E3D and AVEVA Marine products.
AVEVA
E3D is the latestgeneration 3D product which carries a price premium reflecting its higher productivity and advanced feature set.
AVEVA E3D was launched in 2013 and is being developed further each year.
We are now seeing real traction in customer uptake.
Sales grew strongly during the year as existing customers continued to migrate towards it and new contracts were won.
AVEVA E3D contributed almost 13% of total revenue up from just below 10% in the prior year.
More than 3D MT3D Within MT3D the largest product sets are schematics applications such as PandID Instrumentation and Electrical applications and our unique multidiscipline AVEVA Engineering solution together with information management applications such as AVEVA NET and AVEVA Engage.
Research and Development spend over the last decade 36 % Increase in AVEVA E3D revenue in the last year Dave Wheeldon Chief Technology Officer and Deputy CEO STRATEGIC REPORT We have continued our focus on developing our MT3D products during 201617  for example with continuous improvements to AVEVA Engage and exciting developments around our Instrumentation and Electrical applications.
AVEVA Engage in particular started to gain real traction in 201617 .
When it was launched in 2015 Engage created a new benchmark in information accessibility through combining ultrahigh performance visualisation with application agnostic access to information via largeformat touch devices and it has now become a feature of many of our key new OO customer wins.
SaaS and the Cloud We launched our first public Cloud products AVEVA Connect and AVEVA NET Connect at the AVEVA World Summit in October 2016.
AVEVA
Connect is our SaaS ecosystem for Engineering Design and Information Management products.
AVEVA NET Connect is our new Information ManagementasaService offering.
AVEVA Connect will deliver new opportunities to drive down IT costs improve flexibility to scale software usage to meet project demand and increase focus on core business activities without compromising security or user experience.
With
AVEVA NET Connect the Digital Asset will have the capability to be rapidly deployed in the Cloud allowing crossdisciplinary teams to collaborate and share information with complete clarity on the engineered status of the entire project or operating asset.
This will enable greater collaboration between all parties in the supply chain and better decision making by asset operators.
VIRTUAL REALITY Some of our graduates using our HoloLenscompatible software Further to this we recently completed the development of our SaaSbased Information Standards Management tools.
Throughout our history we have partnered with our customers to develop new ways in which technology can deliver business benefits and in this case we are working with several major Owner Operators as earlyadopter customers.
Both
Asset Visualisation and Information Standards Management provide entry points for our Owner Operator customers to access Digital Asset SoftwareasaService solutions flexibly and cost effectively.
Looking to the future We maintain our continued focus on delivering innovation seeking to transform how activities are undertaken or even by eliminating entire steps in business processes.
Our goal is to enhance efficiency drive down costs and improving quality and business agility for our customers.
Over the last decade AVEVA has spent nearly 300 million on Research and Development and we will continue our investments to remain at the leading edge of technology.
While our RandD costs fell by 1.0% on a constant currency basis during 201617  this reflected efficiencies achieved through expanding our presence in Hyderabad India and reducing costs in other locations.
Overall capabilities were not reduced.
Our development efforts are focused on extending the competitiveness of our existing products developing our Cloud platform enhancing our MT3D product suite and on developing exciting new technologies to support growth in the longer term.
An interesting example of this is our current development work around augmented and virtual reality where we are developing the capacity to let customers feel the experience of being inside their models and data.
We will continue to innovate and work closely with our customers in this coming year and I look forward to reporting back to you with our progress.
Dave Wheeldon Chief Technology Officer and Deputy CEO 23 May 2017 24 AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 David Ward Chief Financial Officer AVEVA delivered a solid performance in the financial year ended 31 March 2017.
Reported revenue and profit showed growth over the previous year and cash generation was particularly strong.
We ended the year with 130.9 million in net cash and no debt 2016  107.9 million.
Overview of financial progress Total revenue for the year was 215.8 million which was up 7 .1% compared to the previous year 2016 201.5 million and reported profit before tax was 46.9 million which was up 59.5% compared to the previous year 2016  29.4 million.
On an adjusted basis profit before tax was 55.0 million which was an increase of 7 .4% 2016  51.2 million.
The weakening of Sterling had the impact of increasing reported revenues and costs by 11.4% and 9.4% respectively reflecting the significant overseas operations of the Group.
On a constant currency basis revenue declined 3.8% although the rate of reduction decelerated during the year with the second half being minus 2.1% on a constant currency basis or broadly flat excluding the impact of the difficult market in Latin America.
Revenue
Revenue model The Group sells its proprietary software products by licensing rights to use the software directly to customers through our network of global sales offices.
We operate a righttouse licensing model.
Customers can choose to pay Initial Licence Fees followed by lower mandatory Annual Fees to cover support maintenance and upgrades or Rental Licence Fees.
The latter are usually paid upfront on an annual basis.
Over a long period it is usually cheaper for a customer to adopt the Initial Licence Fee model.
However many customers particularly EPCs prefer to view software as a more flexible operational expense which can be charged to a project as opposed to a capital expense and therefore use the rental model.
AVEVA also generates revenue from Training and Services.
This is typically associated with the implementation of new installations customisation to meet specific customer requirements and end user training.
Revenue by category AVEVA generated 14.9% of revenue from Initial Licence Fees 33.3% of revenue from Annual Fees 43.6% of revenue from Rental Licence Fees and 8.2% from Training and Services.
Recurring revenue which consists of Annual Fees and Rental Licence Fees increased by 7 .8% to 166.0 million 2016  154.0 million representing 76.9% of revenue 2016  76.4%.

2 Constant currency is calculated by restating the periods reported results to reflect the previous years average exchange rates.
Annual fees grew 13.2% to 71.8 million 2016  63.4 million but were broadly flat in constant currency terms.
This reflects high rates of customer retention new customer wins and a low impact from price increases.
Rental Licence Fees also grew in reported terms but there was a decline in constant currency terms of 4.6%.
This reduction was to a large part attributable to the continuing weak market conditions in Latin America and specifically Brazil which accounted for 2.8% of the decline.
Outside of Latin America Rental Licence Fees showed reasonable resilience in difficult market conditions particularly for customers operating in the Oil and Gas sector although some EPC customers did reduce their seat count reflecting lower activity.
Initial Licence Fee revenue was 32.2 million representing an increase of 9.5% 2016  29.4 million reflecting the impact of currency translation with the constant currency result being a decrease of 2.7%.
There were a few significant wins with Owner Operators who chose to buy initial licences.
Training and Services revenue was down by 2.8% to 17 .6 million 2016  18.1 million as a result of fewer customer implementation projects.
On a constant currency basis revenue was down 13.8%.
AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Cost focus AVEVA has a largely fixed cost base albeit with some annual inflation embedded within it.
We exercised strong cost control during the financial year in the context of the difficult end market conditions.
We have however maintained adequate levels of investment in RandD and sales capabilities to ensure that we can execute our strategy and grow sales over the medium and long term.
Overall in constant currency terms operating costs were 0.9% lower than the previous year with the effect of cost management actions more than compensating for inflationary pressures and planned areas of investment.
We continue to have a focused and disciplined approach to managing the cost base.
During the year we undertook some restructuring activity which included headcount reductions in Latin America and corporate management.
FINANCE REVIEW CONTINUED An analysis of revenue by geography is set out below.
Change 6.6% 4.9% 16.3% 7.1% Constant currency change 6.4% 4.2% 3.9% 3.8% An analysis of operating expenses on a normalised basis is set out below.

As reported 31.9 93.0 31.9 156.8 Normalised adjustments 4.7 3.8 1.3 9.8 Normalised costs 27.2 89.2 30.6 147.0 Change 5.8% 7.2% 14.6% 8.4% Constant currency change 1.2% 3.1% 6.0% 0.9% Regional execution On a regional basis the Group performed well in the Americas.
Sales were particularly strong in North America although the difficult market conditions in Latin America caused a further decline in revenues in that region.
AVEVAs performance in EMEA and Asia Pacific was robust in the context of the subdued Oil and Gas and Marine markets.
Reported revenue was impacted by a 22.0 million 11.4% benefit related to foreign exchange translation.
Around 20% of the Groups revenues were in each of Sterling and Euros and the US dollar was the next most material currency at around 15%.
Asia Pacific Revenue from the Asia Pacific region was 76.3 million 2016  71.6 million and increased 6.6% over the prior year but declined 6.4% in constant currency terms.
More specifically we saw strong performance in Japan with a few significant new wins but marginally weaker performance in South Korea and India in the face of a tough market for Marine.
Our businesses in China and South East Asia were broadly flat when compared to the prior year.
EMEA
In EMEA revenue grew 4.9% to 106.6 million 2016  101.6 million.
Market conditions in EMEA have been reasonably stable but remain challenging for customers with heavy exposure to Oil and Gas.
However we saw real growth in Germany and Finland where we won business in Paper and Pulp and revenue from Central and Southern Europe was higher in reported terms but performance in constant currency terms was slightly down on the prior year.
Our businesses in Russia and the Middle East performed broadly in line with last year.
Training and Services revenue declined from the prior year as a number of implementation projects were completed.
Americas
In the Americas revenue grew 16.3% to 32.9 million 2016  28.3 million with a very strong performance in North America being partly offset by ongoing weakness in Latin America where revenues have now declined to a level that is no longer material to the Group.
Our performance in North America was very pleasing with revenue in the USA increasing 18.9% in constant currency terms following the aforementioned customer wins with Southern Company TerraPower and a very large global industrial company.
Market conditions in Brazil remained very tough through 201617 and our revenues from Latin America more than halved over the prior year on both a reported and constant currency basis.
We took action during the second half of the year to rightsize our team there for the reduced market size.
STRATEGIC REPORT Normalised items include amortisation of intangibles excluding other software of 5.8 million 2016  5.6 million sharebased payments of 1.1 million 2016  0.5 million gains on fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts of 0.7 million 2016  loss of 0.4 million and exceptional items of 3.6 million 2016  15.2 million.
Research and Development costs were broadly flat on a normalised constant currency basis reflecting a few strategic investments and efficiencies achieved through expanding our presence in Hyderabad India and reducing costs in other locations.
Overall our average RandD headcount through the year increased by 12%.
Selling and distribution expenses include the costs of our direct sales force as well as our regionally based technical support and marketing teams and in total were 89.2 million in the year 201617 .
The cost of these teams decreased by 3.1% on a constant currency basis principally due to a lower bad debt charge than in the prior year of 0.6 million 2016  3.4 million.
Administrative expenses increased 6.0% or 1.6 million on a constant currency basis with the increase due to some minor investments in the HR team and a small increase in the cost of staff bonuses.
Exceptional items During the year the Group incurred exceptional costs of 1.9 million 2016  15.2 million.
These included restructuring costs of 4.2 million which were partly offset by factors including an indemnified receivable claim relating to a previous business combination.
The restructuring costs related to the rationalisation of offices and reduction in headcount in specific areas of the business.
Also included are the redundancy costs incurred in eliminating the Regional Operations layer of management as part of the initiative to structure the business with clearer lines of accountability.
Prior year exceptional items included professional fees of 10.5 million principally for legal and financial due diligence services related to the aborted Schneider Electric transaction and exceptional restructuring costs of 4.5 million.
Profit before tax Adjusted profit before tax was 55.0 million 2016  51.2 million an increase of 7 .4% principally caused by the growth in revenue.
This resulted in an adjusted profit margin of 25.5% 2016  25.4%.
Reported profit before tax was 46.9 million 2016  29.4 million.
The growth of 59.5% was principally due to growth in revenue and reduction in exceptional items as described above.
Taxation
The Groups effective tax rate on an adjusted basis has steadily declined over recent years in line with the reductions seen in UK corporation tax.
The adjusted effective tax rate for the 201617 financial year was 22.1% which represented a further reduction from 2016 when the rate was 22.5%.
We see this trend continuing as the UK corporate rate reduces and we increasingly benefit from Patent Box relief.
The headline or unadjusted effective rate for the year was 18.8% 2016  30.4%.
The prior year rate was impacted by nondeductible acquisitionrelated exceptional costs of 10.5 million see above.
Dividends
With consistent and strong cash flows and no net debt the Group retains considerable financial flexibility.
The
Board remains focused on delivering growth both organically and through acquisitions.
Our strong cash flows underpin the Boards sustainable progressive dividend policy which is balanced against keeping cash available for MandA opportunities with excess capital being returned to shareholders from time to time.
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 27 .0 pence per share taking the total dividend for the year to 40.0 pence 2016  36.0 pence per share an increase of 11.1%.
The dividend will be payable on 4 August 2017  to shareholders on the register on 7 July 2017 .
As announced previously we have rebalanced the interim and final dividends with more of the total dividend being paid at the interim.
As a result the final dividend proposed for 201617 of 27 .0 pence is slightly lower than the final dividend paid in respect of 201516 30.0 pence per share.
Operating cash flow before tax Adjusted diluted EPS 28 AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 FINANCE REVIEW CONTINUED Earnings per share Basic earnings per share was 59.52 pence and increased 85.8% 2016  32.03 pence and diluted earnings per share were 59.36 pence 2016  31.96 pence.
On an adjusted basis EPS increased 8.0% to 66.98 pence 2016  62.04 pence and to 66.81 pence on a diluted basis 2016  61.91 pence.
Balance sheet and cash flows AVEVA continues to maintain a strong balance sheet and has no debt.
Net assets at 31 March 2017 were 220.7 million compared to 201.0 million at 31 March 2016.
Noncurrent assets increased marginally to 89.9 million 2016 87 .5 million principally due to foreign currency translation effects.
During the year we purchased intangible software rights for a total of 2.3 million which provided valuable additional functionality for our products.
Working capital Gross trade receivables at 31 March 2017 were 91.1 million which was broadly in line with last year 2016 94.5 million.
We again saw a strong finish to the year with a large number of our Global Account renewals occurring in the final quarter.
This resulted in billings being more weighted towards the end of the period although Q4 cash collections were marginally stronger than in 201516.
The bad debt provision at 31 March 2017 of 6.1 million was similar in scale to the level held at the previous year end of 5.9 million.
Deferred income remained stable at 31 March 2017 and was 45.9 million compared to 46.9 million at 31 March 2016.
Trade and other payables were higher than the prior year at 42.9 million 2016  37 .2 million.
Cash generation Net cash including treasury deposits at 31 March 2017 was 130.9 million compared to 107 .9 million at 31 March 2016.
Cash generated from operating activities before tax was 57 .2 million 2016  36.1 million with large parts of this improvement being due to the increased profit recorded in 201617 and the high exceptional costs incurred and paid in 201516.
Pensions
On an accounting basis the Groups net retirement benefit obligations decreased from 5.2 million last year to 2.6 million.
This was principally caused by the valuation of the UK defined benefit pension scheme moving from a deficit of 2.3 million to a surplus of 1.2 million driven by employer contributions of 1.6 million and strong asset returns over the period.
Since March 2015 the UK defined benefit pension scheme has been closed to future accrual.
Capital structure At 31 March 2017  the Group had 63975869 shares of 3 59p each in issue 2016  63961113 shares.
During the year the AVEVA Group Employee Benefit Trust 2008 the Trust purchased 2160 ordinary shares in the Company in the open market at an average price of 18.68 per share for total consideration of 40349 in order to satisfy awards made under the AVEVA Group Management Bonus Deferred Share Scheme 2008.
At
31 March 2017  the Trust owned 10857 ordinary shares in the Company.
13380 shares 2016  26791 with an attributable cost of 296431 were issued to employees in satisfying share options that were exercised.
Treasury policy The Group treasury policy aims to ensure that the capital held is not put at risk and the treasury function is managed under policies and procedures approved by the
These policies are designed to reduce the financial risk arising from the Groups normal trading activities which primarily relate to credit interest liquidity and currency risk.
The Group is and expects to continue to be cash positive and at 31 March 2017 held net cash of 130.9 million.
The treasury policy includes strict counterparty limits.
David Ward Chief Financial Officer 23 May 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT
Corporate risk register Functional risk registers PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERT AINTIES AVEVA FACES A NUMBER OF POTENTIAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE GROUPS LONG TERM
THE BOARD IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DETERMINING THE NATURE OF THESE RISKS AND ENSURING APPROPRIATE MITIGATING ACTIONS ARE IN PLACE TO MANAGE THEM EFFECTIVEL Y .
Risk management process The Board retains ultimate responsibility for the Groups risk management and as part of this regularly completes a review of the Group Risk Register and an assessment of the adequacy of the mitigating controls identified by management.
To aid this process a Risk Committee comprising senior management from each function of the business was formed in 201516.
The Risk Committee is chaired by the CFO and reports jointly to the Board and the Executive team.
The Risk Committee meets at least twice a year and has responsibility for considering risk appetite risk identification risk quantification qualification and the determination of mitigating internal controls.
The
Risk Committee is not responsible for internal audit activities which remain under the responsibility of the Audit Committee.
More details of AVEVAs assessment of internal controls is included within the Audit Committee report on pages 44 to 46 of the Corporate Governance section of the Directors report.
The Risk Register was compiled after considering three main risk characteristics  likelihood size of impact and timeframe for when the risk may impact the Group.
Likelihood was assessed on a net risk basis i. currently faced by AVEVA.
Separately the Audit Committee has responsibility for determining the appropriate level of review required to ensure that internal controls are operating as designed.
This year we have continued to improve our risk management process by drafting departmental risk registers to supplement the Group Risk Register.
Next year we intend that the highest risks from each departmental register are considered for inclusion on the Group Risk Register.
The updated Group Risk Register was ultimately reviewed and approved by the Board and in the context of the assessment of viability the Board considered which risks and combination of risks would threaten the viability of the Company.
The principal risks faced by the Group are set out on pages 30 to 31 and include indicators of the financial impact likelihood and whether the risk has increased or decreased in significance since the last review.
Viability Statement In accordance with the revised UK Corporate Governance Code the Directors have assessed the Groups prospects and viability over a period significantly longer than the outlook of the going concern statement of 12 months.
The Directors have determined that the appropriate period is three years corresponding with the period covered by the Groups business planning cycle.
The Directors considered the principal risks in plausible but severe scenarios and assessed the potential impact of a decline in the Groups revenue caused by a period of sustained low economic growth resulting in low levels of capital investment and this was combined with an unfavourable foreign exchange assumption.
Based on this assessment the Directors have considered the Groups current position and principal risks and have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over a threeyear period.
In making this statement the Directors have also made the following assumptions oil prices will stay relatively flat for the next three years Brexit will not unduly affect current trading or existing customer contracts or relationships our internal controls in mitigation of a significant proportion of the risks on the register continue to operate effectively.
Going concern statement The Group has significant financial resources is profitable has high levels of recurring revenue and has a strong position in the markets it serves.
At
31 March 2017  the Group had cash and treasury deposit balances of 130.9 million 2016  107 .9 million and no debt.
Therefore after making enquiries and considering the cash flow forecasts for the Group the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.

Strategies
1 More than 3D MT3D 2 Owner Operators 3 Growth markets 4 Broadening market exposure 5 SaaS and the Cloud Risk Likelihood Impact Change Mitigation Strategy Dependency on key markets AVEVA generates a substantial amount of its income from customers whose main business is derived from capital projects in the Oil and Gas Power and Marine markets.
Currently some of AVEVAs vertical end markets are under pressure with lower oil prices and inevitably this is having an impact on the Groups revenues.
As the availability of capital expenditure returns to our key markets particularly Oil and Gas the balance may shift away from our traditional core sector of complex offshore projects towards simpler onshore projects such as shale gas extraction.
The risk of this further reinforces our need for market diversification.
AVEVA is expanding into other market segments such as Power Petrochemical and Chemical and Construction albeit from a relatively small base.
It is central to our strategy to diversify our customer offerings into Owner Operators and Plant operations.
This will help secure a longer term income stream that extends beyond the designbuild phase of these capital projects.
In addition our extensive global presence provides some mitigation from overreliance on key geographic markets.
Competition
AVEVA operates in highly competitive markets that serve the Oil and Gas Power and Marine markets.
Our 3D design tools are well established in our markets and we believe that there are a relatively small number of significant competitors.
However some of these competitors could in the future pose a greater competitive threat to AVEVAs revenues particularly if they consolidate or form strategic or commercial relationships among themselves or with larger well capitalised companies.
Further threats are posed by the entrance into AVEVAs markets of a much larger technology competitor or transformational technology such as Cloudbased solutions.
The Groups strategy to extend the Digital Asset footprint is key to ensuring that our customer penetration is broad and that AVEVAs sources of revenue are diversified.
We carefully monitor customers and other suppliers operating within our chosen markets.
We stay close to our customers and ensure we have a strong understanding of their needs and their expectations from the AVEVA product development roadmap.
We expect that the customers we serve will over the next 3 to 5 years show an increased appetite or insistence on their software needs being delivered with more flexibility.
AVEVA is already well progressed with its Cloud strategy and expects to be able to meet these customer demands as they develop.
Professional Services Where AVEVA assists customers with the deployment of an enterprise solution this involves some degree of consulting and or implementation work.
This requires specialist knowledge to be available and well managed potentially in many geographic locations.
There is a risk that the services provided do not meet the customers expectations or that technical difficulties are encountered.
In some instances we may opt to partner with a third party for this work and this relationship also requires careful management and maintenance to ensure that AVEVAs strong reputation with our customers is not damaged.
We employ experienced industry professionals within our professional services team and continue to build commercial partnerships with third party systems integrators.
We have rigorous processes and controls for the appraisal of potential commercial opportunities prior to any bid being submitted.
Bids are appraised on grounds of technical complexity as well as financial and commercial risk.
Acquisitions
An acquisition by AVEVA or of AVEVA could pose a significant distraction to management and to the delivery of our business plan.
The Group expects to continue to review acquisition targets as part of its strategy.
The integration of acquisitions involves a number of unique risks including diversion of managements attention failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business failure to realise the benefits anticipated to result from the acquisition and successful integration of the acquired intellectual property.
While each acquisition and integration is unique AVEVA now has an experienced team to appraise and complete acquisitions.
The Groups experience of previous bolton acquisitions as well as the aborted transaction with Schneider Electric provides a good understanding of potential transaction and integration risks.
5 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL RISKS Risk Likelihood Impact Change Mitigation Strategy Foreign exchange risk Exposure to foreign currency gains and losses can be material to the Group with more than 80% of the Groups revenue denominated in a currency other than Sterling of which our two largest are US Dollar and Euro.
The result of the UK referendum on European Union membership has led to significant weakening of the British Pound and the volatility is likely to continue until further certainty is reached over exit negotiations.
The overseas subsidiaries predominantly trade in their own local currencies which acts as a partial natural hedge against currency movements.
In addition the Group enters into forward foreign currency contracts to manage the risk where material and practical.
The Group limits its hedging of revenue to US Dollar Euro and Japanese Yen and its hedging of costs to Swedish Krona and Indian Rupee.
Risk Likelihood Impact Change Mitigation Strategy Recruitment and retention of employees AVEVAs success has been built on the quality and reputation of its products and services which rely almost entirely on the quality of the people developing and delivering them.
Managing this pool of highly skilled and motivated individuals across all disciplines and geographies remains key to our ongoing success.
The Group endeavours to ensure that employees are motivated in their work and there are regular appraisals with staff encouraged to develop their skills.
Annually there is a Groupwide salary review that rewards strong performance and ensures salaries remain competitive.
Commission and bonus schemes help to ensure the success of the Group and individual achievement is appropriately rewarded.
Protection of intellectual property The Groups success has been built upon the development of its substantial intellectual property rights and the future growth of the business requires the continual protection of these tools.
The protection of the Groups proprietary software products is achieved by licensing rights to use the application rather than selling or licensing the computer source code.
The Group uses third party technology to encrypt protect and restrict access to its products.
Access limitations and rights are also defined within the terms of the software licence agreement.
The Group seeks to ensure that its intellectual property rights are appropriately protected by law and seeks to vigorously assert its proprietary rights wherever possible.
Research and Development The Group makes substantial investments in Research and Development in enhancing existing products and introducing new products and must effectively appraise its investment decisions and ensure that we continue to provide classleading solutions that meet the needs of our markets.
Our software products are complex and new products or enhancements may contain undetected errors failures performance problems or defects which may impact our strong reputation with our customers.
AVEVA continually reviews the alignment of the activities of our Research and Development teams to ensure that they remain focused on areas that will meet the demands of our customers and deliver appropriate financial returns.
This process is managed by developing a product roadmap that identifies the schedule for new products and the enhancements that will be made to successive versions of existing products.
Products are extensively tested prior to commercial launch.
International operations The Group operates in over 30 countries globally and must determine how best to utilise its resources across these diverse markets.
Where necessary the business must adapt its market approach to best capitalise on local market opportunities particularly in the strategically key growth economies.
In addition the Group is required to comply with the local laws regulations and tax legislation in each of these jurisdictions.
Significant changes in these laws and regulations or failure to comply with them could lead to additional liabilities and penalties.
The Group manages its overseas operations by employing locally qualified personnel who are able to provide expertise in the appropriate language and an understanding of local culture custom and practice.
Local management is supported by local professional advisers and further oversight is maintained from the Groups corporate legal financial and internal audit functions.
OPERATIONAL RISKS 32 AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Internal Stakeholders AVEVA is a diverse organisation with employees in over 30 countries and from many different cultures.
As of 31 March 2017  we have a headcount of 1707 2016  1706 and our malefemale ratio is 75%  25% 2016  75%  25%.
Keeping employees informed of business priorities and changes remains a primary focus within
As a global organisation it is important that everyone feels part of AVEVA and that we share information across all teams and regions.
This is achieved through regular internal communication initiatives such as people stories successes and competitions with the aims to be inclusive and to celebrate our diversity.
Engagement levels remain high and we use feedback from our Global Ambassador Network to improve and develop information that both informs and motivates our employees.
Our Global Ambassador Network continues to provide a channel for our employees to provide feedback to the senior management team and helps us to gain cultural insights from the areas in which our employees are based.
To help our largest regions stay informed on both corporate and regionallyfocussed news we operate editorial teams to manage the networks regional communications.
These updates receive excellent readership rates and feedback has shown they are a great tool to support our employees in their roles.
External Stakeholders Transparency and disclosure are fundamental to our relationships with customers partners and suppliers.
We maintain open honest and fair discussions with each of our stakeholders to reinforce our reputation as a trusted and ethical organisation.
To protect the interest of our customers our expanded AntiPiracy and Compliance team monitors the illegal use of AVEVA software and enforces compliance within our terms and conditions.
AVEVA continues to invest in both people and technology to ensure compliant use of its technology.
Whilst illegal use of our software is an ongoing challenge AVEVA is becoming much more successful in the detection of such cases and the subsequent enforcement of licence terms.
To embed and reinforce our corporate policy against the acceptance or payment of bribes we continue to enhance and improve our eLearning tools.
Each year every employee completes the Global Corporate Governance and Group IT Compliance training to ensure that we maintain our high ethical standards.
We review monthly operational challenges in the key regional hubs to ensure local governance.
Employee Engagement Employee feedback is a priority at AVEVA and we are constantly seeking ways to improve the way our employees provide feedback to both managers and our Executive team.
In April 2017  we introduced a new micro survey tool designed to frequently seek employee feedback and opinions on key topics.
Whilst retaining our traditional full biannual survey this tool will be a way of gaining supplementary employee insights on a regular basis.
Due to the nature of the tool managers will have instant access to results and can quickly plan actions changes or interventions as necessary.
We have also increased the accessibility and visibility of the Executive team through global roadshows and briefings for all employees.
Focussed on specific business updates these sessions are an informal way for the Executive team to meet and discuss key updates and to answer any questions employees may have.
Between April and June 2016 there were 18 meetandgreet sessions held in various global locations reaching nearly 75% of employees.
CORPORA TE RESPONSIBILITY AVEVA IS COMMITTED TO SUPPORTING ITS EMPLOYEES AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES AROUND THE WORLD AND THIS REPORT CONTINUES TO DEMONSTRATE THE BROAD RANGE OF ACTIVITIES AVEVA AND ITS EMPLOYEES PARTICIPATE IN.

In recognition of our commitment to young talent we are on the UK top 100 Apprentice Employer list.
It is also crucial we attract students from Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics STEM subjects as early as possible both through our work experience and membership of specific science and engineering groups including the BCS and the Engineering Development Trust.
AVEVA was also present at the Big Bang Fair where over 100000 attendees came to hear more about careers within our core industries and we have sponsored a number of innovation awards to inspire the next generation of talent to continue their projects.
AVEVA is also an active member with our CEO as Executive signatory of the WISE Women in Science and Engineering Ten Steps campaign.
This membership will enable us to become widely recognised as a company supporting diversity and inclusion fairness and equality and inspiring women into technical and senior roles.
Our wellestablished learning and development programmes continue to provide a range of opportunities for our employees.
This includes online language studies technical development and management and leadership programmes.
We also have compliance elearning in place which is monitored regularly.
Last year we saw 5000 hours of online technical training PluralSight completed 4688 hours of classroom training 33 colleagues completing management development 42 graduates and 12 apprentices start their careers with AVEVA An increased uptake of coaching opportunities for managers at all levels including the Executive team.
AVEVA in the Community 201617 has been a very active year for Corporate Social Responsibility at AVEVA with colleagues from across the globe taking time out to support a variety of local national and international causes.
At AVEVA we encourage and celebrate our employees charitable efforts and share exceptional activities carried out via our corporate intranet.
We operate a programme of matched funding and in addition during the year we donated 45000 to local and national charitable causes.
In January 2017  we were also honoured to be included in the FTSE4Good index in recognition of our efforts to operate in an ethically responsible manner.
There have been so many highlights this past year but one that particularly demonstrates our colleagues enthusiasm for supporting the local communities we operate in came from our team in Hyderabad.
In October 2016 the Hyderabad office came together to support a local school and the generosity behind their actions was truly remarkable.
As well as organising a very successful clothes drive additional items were purchased by the team for donation such as brightlycoloured hair clips remembering how much they had loved them as a child.
A member of the team also approached a local street seller they had frequently passed on their way to work and arranged for him to come to the school with a variety of different items so the children could be given something that fitted them.
Nearly
50 new dresses were purchased that day which will have made a huge boost to the street sellers income.
There was also a more serious side to the visit with the team spending some time teaching the children about hygiene and joining in on a maths lesson.

Independence of NonExecutive Directors and segregation of duties The Board has considered the independence of the NonExecutive Directors and believes that all are currently independent of management and free from any material business or other relationships that could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.
Their biographies on pages 42 and 43 demonstrate a range of experience and sufficient calibre to bring independent judgement on issues of strategy performance resources and standards of conduct which are vital to the Group.

The most recent review was carried out in October 2016 led by the Chairman and conducted following oneon one interviews with each Director.
GOVERNANCE REPORT Overall the review concluded that the Board and its Committees had demonstrated a high degree of effectiveness.
The Board is considered to be of the right size and having appropriate skills representation.
The October 2016 review identified five priorities in the form of broader discussion at Board level of risk management and succession planning a greater development of the annual strategy day formalisation of the internal audit function the appointment of a NonExecutive Director with software development andor end market experience and an increase in senior management presentations to the Board.
Each of these areas of development has been incorporated into the Boards schedule for the next year and into objectives for the Executive Directors or Board Committees.
Internal control and risk management The Board has overall responsibility for the Groups system of internal control and for monitoring its effectiveness.
However such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure and by its very nature can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The principal risks and uncertainties the Group faces are set out on pages 30 and 31.
There were no significant control failures during the year.
The Board has established a continuous process for identifying evaluating and managing the significant risks the Group faces.
The Board regularly reviews the effectiveness of the Groups internal controls which have been in place from the start of the year to the date of approval of this report and believes that it is in accordance with the September 2014 Financial Reporting Council

The Boards monitoring covers all material controls including financial nonfinancial operational and compliance controls and risk management.
It is based principally on reviewing reports from management to consider whether significant risks are identified evaluated managed and controlled and whether any significant weaknesses are promptly remedied and indicate a need for more extensive monitoring.
The
Board periodically carries out visits to the Groups subsidiaries and receives presentations from local management on their operations.
The Board has also performed a specific assessment for the purpose of this Annual Report.
This involved reviewing the Groups risk matrix that had been reviewedupdated by the Groups Risk Committee with representatives involved from the Executive team and senior managers.
This assessment considered all significant aspects of internal control necessary for the Company to successfully carry out the key business strategies of the Group together with more generic inherent risks of the Groups operations.

Senior managers from Product Development Business Strategy and Finance also attended analyst and shareholder meetings during the year.

Philip Aiken
23 May 2017 GOVERNANCE REPORT During the financial year the Nominations Committee comprised a majority of independent Non Executive Directors chaired by Philip Aiken.
The Committee has responsibility for Board and Committee composition particularly in relation to the diversity of background skills and experience.
The Committee oversees the nomination selection and appointment of NonExecutive and Executive Directors and monitors succession planning for the Board and senior management roles.
In 201617  the Committee met three times and the main areas that it concentrated on were succession planning Board refreshment and Board and senior management appointments.
Succession planning and Board refreshment Effective succession planning is vital for the longterm success of the Company.
There have been considerable changes to the composition of the Board during the financial year and the Committee has taken a lead role in the process for the appointment of both Executive and NonExecutive Directors and senior management.
A key requirement of the succession planning and Board evaluation has been to ensure a balance of skills experience independence and knowledge that is appropriate to manage future growth and strategic plans of the Company.
With the appointments during the course of 2016 of our new Chief Executive our new Chief Financial Officer and our two new Non Executive Directors the Committee considers that at the same time as promoting very able internal people with vast Company knowledge the Company has also gained experienced Board members who will complement and add depth to the skills and balance of the Board.
Details of Board changes On 31 December 2016 after 33 years with the Group 17 years of which as Chief Executive Richard Longdon stepped down from his role as Chief Executive and Executive Director of the Company.
On 8 July 2016 James Kidd previously Chief Financial Officer since 2011 was announced as being Richard Longdons successor as Chief Executive and was appointed as deputy Chief Executive with effect from that date.
James assumed the role of Chief Executive with effect from 1 January 2017 .
Additionally on 8 July 2016 David Ward was appointed Chief Financial Officer having previously held the position of Head of Finance since 2011.
In respect of these appointments as Executive Directors the Committee considered the two internal candidates to be the most suitable candidates bearing in mind in particular their knowledge of and service with the Company.
The Chairman of the Nominations Committee and the remainder of the Board considered the independence of Philip Dayer now that he is in his third term of office.
It was concluded that he remained independent and continued to contribute to the operation of the
Philip Dayer will not stand for reelection at the 2017 AGM.
Jonathan Brooks resigned from the Board with effect from 8 November 2016.
In respect of the intended resignation of Jonathan Brooks in November 2016 Christopher Humphrey was duly appointed as a NonExecutive Director on 8 July 2016 this being as part of a transition process between the two NonExecutive Directors and Christopher Humphrey became Chair of the Audit Committee with effect from 2 November 2016.
Additionally in advance of the intent for Philip Dayer not to stand for reelection at the 2017 AGM Ron Mobed was appointed as a NonExecutive Director on 1 March 2017 .
It was also decided that Jennifer Allerton should assume the position of Remuneration Committee Chair.
In relation to both of these appointments the Company consulted with a number of search firms and retained the services of Spencer Stuart to provide suitable candidates for consideration by the Nominations Committee.
Short listed candidates were interviewed by the Chairman and other Non Executive and Executive Directors.
On appointment all Directors are asked to confirm that they have sufficient time to devote to the role which is confirmed together with details of their duties in the letter of appointment.
All Directors undergo an induction as soon as practical following their appointment.
As part of the induction process Directors are provided with background information on the Group and attend the Groups headquarters in Cambridge for meetings and presentations from senior management.
In addition where appropriate meetings are also arranged with the Groups advisers.
Diversity policy The Board considers that diversity including diversity of gender is very important when reviewing the composition of the Board and possible new appointments.
That said whilst the Board notes the 2016 Hampton Alexander report on FTSE women leaders it has not set targets on gender balance.
The Board considers that the most important consideration is to appoint people based on merit skills and relevant experience with a view to enhancing the balance and effectiveness of the Board.

The Audit Committee has a number of responsibilities to undertake regular scrutiny of the Group s financial performance ensuring the financial integrity of the Group is effective ensuring the Group has the appropriate risk management processes and internal controls and ensuring that the internal and external audit processes are robust.

Philip Dayer Jennifer Allerton Christopher Humphrey from 8 July 2016 Ron Mobed from 1 March 2017 Brief biographical details for all the members of the Committee are included on pages 42 and 43.
The Audit Committee provides effective governance over external financial reporting risk management and internal controls and reports its findings and recommendations to the
In my capacity as Chairman of the Audit Committee I am pleased to report on the operations of the Committee during the past year with emphasis on the specific matters we have considered including compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code the Code and associated Guidance on Audit
I confirm that we have fully complied with the requirements of the Code as issued in April 2016.
I was appointed Chairman of the Committee on 2 November 2016 succeeding Jonathan Brooks who stood down from the Board in the same month.
I would like to thank Jonathan for his work as Audit Committee Chairman and also for his time in handing over this responsibility to me.
The Board believes I have the necessary recent and relevant financial experience as required by the Code as I am a Chartered Management Accountant and a Fellow of CIMA and have most recently held the role of Chief Executive Officer and previously Group Finance Director of Anite plc a UK listed company and previously senior positions in finance at Conoco Eurotherm International plc and Critchley Group plc.
I have maintained an uptodate understanding of financial and corporate governance best practice by attending many training sessions and updates presented by the major accounting firms.
The Board also considers that the other members of the Committee have a broad range of appropriate skills and experiences covering financial commercial and operational matters.
My induction process involved me meeting senior members of AVEVAs Financial Management team prior to Jonathans departure and I was closely involved with the half year reporting processes relating to 2016.
I have met with key internal employees and representatives of Ernst and Y oung EY to learn more about the workings of the Groups financial reporting and audit process.
During the year I chaired two meetings of the Audit Committee.
Audit Committee terms of reference The Audit Committee monitors the integrity of the financial statements of the Group and the Committee members as part of the full Board review all proposed announcements to be made by the Group and consideration is given to any significant financial reporting judgements contained in them.
The Committee considers the effectiveness of financial reporting and internal controls compliance with legal requirements accounting standards and the Listing Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority.
We also review any proposed change in accounting policies and any recommendations from the Groups auditor regarding improvements to internal controls GOVERNANCE REPORT and the adequacy of resources within the Groups finance function.
The Committee also assesses the process that has been established to ensure that the Annual Report is fair balanced and understandable reporting to the Board on their findings.
A full copy of the Committees terms of reference is available from the Companys website at site
The Audit Committee meets at least four times each year.
The Company Chairman and CFO are invited to attend all meetings.
The external auditor is also invited to attend.
Members of senior management are invited from time to time to make presentations such as the Committees agenda necessitates.
The Committee meets quarterly with the external auditor without any members of the Executive team being present.
I also meet with the external auditor from time to time away from the Companys offices.
Risk and internal controls The key elements of the Groups internal control framework and procedures are set out on page 46.
The principal risks the Group faces are set out on pages 30 and 31.
Annually the Audit Committee considers the Group Risk Register and related management controls.
Throughout the process the Board or the Audit Committee gives consideration to whether areas should be looked at more closely through specific control reviews identifies areas where enhancement of internal controls is required and agrees action plans to deliver the necessary or recommended enhancements.
Overview of the year s activities In addition to its prescribed duties the Audit Committee undertook several additional projects during the year.
Topic Activity in the year Revenue recognition The Committee received regular updates from management as to its consideration of implications of the new accounting standard for revenue recognition  IFRS 15.
The new revenue recognition standard comes into effect on 1 January 2018 and the first period for which revenue will be reported under IFRS 15 will be the interim period to September 2018.
The Committee is tracking managements progress and a presentation outlining the roadmap and expected impact assessment was presented to the Committee in March 2017.
External audit tender The Committee undertook a tender of the external audit in the summer of 2016 culminating in presentations to the Committee by the incumbent auditor Ernst and Young EY as well as Deloitte and PricewaterhouseCoopers PwC.
The Committee was impressed by the quality of presentations from all three firms and ultimately EY were successful in retaining the audit.
The Committee felt that EY were in the strongest position to manage the risk associated with the Companys transition to the new revenue recognition accounting standard IFRS 15 and were pleased with the competitive fee proposal.
Internal audit The Committee undertook a review of the Groups position on internal audit.
An outline proposal was considered in November 2016 to create an internal audit programme and the level of assurance that such a programme would provide.
The proposal was approved by the Committee and incorporates the establishment of a minimum controls framework against which internal audit testing will be focused.
Following this two internal audit visits to overseas subsidiaries were conducted by members of the Group Finance team and a further visit was conducted by PwC.
More details of the Companys new approach to internal audit is included below.
As part of our ongoing programme of controls assurance the Committee commissioned internal audit to undertake a review of the process and controls involved in the invoicing of annual fees.
Generally the findings were encouraging but some control improvements were recommended to ensure that all price increases available under the customer contracts are incorporated.
Risks and internal controls In March 2017 management presented an update on the Company Risk Register and the continual development of internal controls.
The update included The new AVEVA RACI framework which is being enacted for 2017 18 to support the new regional organisational structure.
The Risk Committee had updated the Corporate Risk Register and established a process of creating functional risk registers which will feed directly into the Corporate Risk Register for a more holistic view of corporate risks.
In furtherance of cyber security a dedicated IT security team has been established and a series of mandatory elearning courses introduced.
We continue to perform periodic phishing simulations which show an encouraging improvement over time.
Nonaudit services Legislation on nonaudit services came into effect on 1 April 2017 restricting what work the statutory auditor can perform.
The Committee has implemented a strict policy which goes beyond the minimum requirements of legislation and shall be monitored closely.
This has necessitated the Committee overseeing a transition of work from Ernst and Young to alternative professional services firms and advisers.
AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 The Audit Committee has developed a framework to gain assurance over the system of internal financial and operational controls.
This comprises A risk assessment performed by operational management and the Board to identify key areas for assurance.
Peer and head office reviews of key risk areas of financial internal control.
During the year subsidiary company control visits were undertaken in Malaysia and Germany and specific reviews were undertaken related to annual fee billing and general customer contracting terms.
The use of qualified third parties to undertake specialist reviews in more technical areas.
During 201617 PwC performed an internal audit of our China operations.
An annual assessment by the Audit Committee of the whole system of internal financial and operational controls.
There is a formal whistleblowing policy which has been communicated to employees.
This policy provides information on the process to follow in the event that any employee feels it is appropriate to make a disclosure.
The Audit Committee is satisfied that the process is effective and reviews key issues which are reported.
Key estimates The Audit Committee discusses with management and the auditor the approach that has been taken in assessing all key estimates.
These include revenue recognition provision for impairment of receivables and the valuation of retirement benefit obligations.
Annually the Committee considers the going concern principle upon which the financial statements are prepared and also the Groups viability statement disclosures.
Internal audit As outlined above during the year the Company has established an internal audit function which is coresourced using Company employees as well as third party specialists.
As a Committee we believe this resourcing model will provide the most effective approach with some audit reviews requiring internal Company knowledge and for other audit review areas specialist input from an independent third party will be optimal.
The Company has initially chosen PwC for its internal audit partner although this appointment is not contractual or for any fixed term.
The Groups operations are geographically widely spread which means that in some instances where assurance over the operation of internal control is considered valuable there is a clear advantage in such reviews of controls being undertaken by teams with specific local regulatory knowledge and without any local language barrier.
Further the Committee believes that such instances favour the provision of assurance from external sources which is considered to be both more efficient and effective.
This will be reviewed on a casebycase basis with PwC performing these visits as necessary.
External audit The Audit Committee advises the Board on the appointment of the external auditor and during 201617 undertook a tender of the role of external auditor.
Three firms were invited to the tender process which involved several meetings with management and culminated in a presentation to the Audit Committee in July 2016.
Ultimately
EY were successful in retaining the audit.
The Committee felt that EY were in the strongest position to manage the risk associated with the Companys transition to the new revenue recognition accounting standard IFRS 15 and were pleased with the competitive fee proposal.
The Committee also advises the Board on the auditors remuneration both for audit and nonaudit work and discusses the nature scope and results of the audit with the external auditor.
From 1 April 2017  new tighter nonaudit services legislation came into effect and at the same time the Groups updated policy.
The legislation and policy severely restricts the level of nonaudit work that the external auditor is able to perform and helps to safeguard the independence and objectivity of the external auditor.
The Committee continues to keep under review the cost effectiveness and quality of the audit service.
Pursuant to the new policy on non audit services the Audit Committee is required to approve any fees paid to the auditor for permissible nonaudit work and delegates the authority for approval of such work to the Chief Financial Officer where the level of fees involved are considered insignificant.
During the year the auditor has ceased all prohibited non audit work.
The Group engages other independent firms of accountants to perform tax consulting work and other consulting engagements to ensure that the independence of the auditor is not compromised.
Audit partners are rotated every five years and a formal statement of independence is received from the auditor each year.
The Board and the Audit Committee are satisfied that the independence of the auditor has been maintained.
The current audit partner Marcus Butler will complete his second year with the Group this year.
Audit planning and main audit issues At the November 2016 meeting of the Committee the auditor presented their audit plan for 201617 .
This included a summary of the proposed audit scope for the year for each of the Groups subsidiaries and a summary of what the auditor considered to be the most significant financial reporting risks facing the Group together with the auditors proposed audit approach to these significant risk areas.
The main area of audit focus for the year is the significant estimate surrounding revenue recognition.
Committee objectives for 2017 18 In March 2017  the Committee considered the objectives for the year ahead and it was agreed the following would be prioritised Complete induction of Ron Mobed as a new Committee member.
Completion of audited conversion to IFRS 15 opening balance sheet position.
Completion of minimum control framework.
Enhancements to product development reporting.
Christopher Humphrey Audit Committee Chairman 23 May 2017 AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED GOVERNANCE REPORT REMUNERA TION COMMITTEE REPORT AT OUR 2017 AGM WE WILL BE SEEKING SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL TO RENEW OUR DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY  AS THE CURRENT POLICY WHICH WAS APPROVED BY SHAREHOLDERS AT OUR 2014 AGM IS DUE TO EXPIRE.
Introduction
In contemplation of this policy renewal the Remuneration Committee conducted a full review of AVEVAs approach to senior Executive remuneration.
The key findings of this review were as follows The main pillars of the current structure should be retained.
AVEVAs past approach of offering longterm equity alignment with shareholders solely via regular annual awards under an L TIP that vest subject to a single EPS target could be improved as follows by continuing to grant standard L TIP awards each year albeit with vesting based upon the achievement of a broader range of targets than previously applied i.
EPS relative TSR and other financialstrategic targets and by the facility to grant restricted shares worth up to 35% of salary each year with a corresponding reduction in the value of L TIP awards granted.
The current annual bonus plan would benefit from a degree of simplification and could be made more reflective of best practice.
Certain minor changes should be made to ensure that our policy continues to reflect AVEVAs circumstances is aligned to and supports achievement of the Companys strategic objectives and takes due account of developments in best practice that have occurred since our current policy was established in 2014.
The current shareholding guidelines of 200% of salary for the CEO and 100% of salary for the CFO should be increased to 300% of salary should restricted share plan awards be granted.
Further details of the changes we are proposing to make to our policy are set out overleaf.
Context in which our review was undertaken AVEVA has delivered a solid performance over the last two years achieving strong recurring revenue and cash flows in the context of tough end market conditions.
There has been a focus on both cost control and the implementation of a strong strategy to drive organic growth over the medium term.
AVEVAs longterm potential cannot be realised without the expertise and commitment of our senior Executive team now headed by James Kidd following Richard Longdons retirement from the Board with James supported by David Ward as our new CFO.
It is therefore important and very much in the longterm interests of our shareholders that we continue to offer remuneration packages that ensure the retention and incentivisation of our key Executives while also ensuring that we keep the prudent approach we have adopted to such matters in the past.
Philip Dayer Remuneration Committee Chairman I SHALL BE STEPPING DOWN FROM THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE AT THE FORTHCOMING AGM TO BE REPLACED BY JENNIFER ALLERTON WHOM I WISH EVERY SUCCESS IN HER ROLE AS CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
On a more general level when conducting its review the Committee was also mindful of the continued focus on Executive remuneration from many quarters including investors the Press and Government.
In formulating our new policy we have taken due account of all relevant developments in market and best practice while also ensuring that our policies and practices are appropriate for AVEVA and achieve our underlying objective of aligning the longterm interests of our Executive Directors and shareholders.
Summary of policy for 2017 onwards The structure of our new Executive Directors Remuneration Policy the Policy is summarised below with the key changes we are proposing to make highlighted where relevant.
Base salaries No changes are proposed to our underlying approach to base salaries save that to reflect best practice we will impose an overall cap on base salaries of 600000 albeit that this does not signify any aspiration or intention to move Executive Directors salaries to this level over the life of the policy.
In terms of actual base salaries of our Executive Directors James Kidds salary moved to 450000 from 400000 in April 2017 as part of the Committees approach to phasing James salary up to the intended level over a period of time.
Note that this is below Richard Longdons salary of 495000 when he retired as CEO on 31 December 2016.
It is intended to further increase James salary to 500000 for 201819 but only if James performance and the Companys underlying circumstances warrant.
Therefore the Committee is taking a prudent approach to James salary progression by phasing the increases.
David Wards base salary when he joined the Board was 230000.
It is also intended that this be increased on a phased basis to a more appropriate level subject to his performance.
As such Davids base salary was increased to 300000 for 2017 18.
Benefits
No changes are proposed to our underlying policy on benefits provision although as with base salaries and to reflect best practice going forward we will impose an overall cap on benefits in this case of 50000 excluding pensionrelated benefits which will remain at 10% of salary for the Executive Directors.
Annual Bonus As noted above our review of the structure of the current annual bonus plan identified a number of features that were unusual not reflective of current market or best practice and which also added to the complexity of the plan The bonus is split between a  core award of up to 100% of salary and an  outperformance award of a further 25% of salary.
Only one metric adjusted PBT is currently used for the financial element whereas it is now common for bonuses to operate with a wider range of financial metrics to encourage performance against a broader range of KPIs.
Up to 10% of the financial element of the bonus can be earned based solely on interim as opposed to full year performance.
The portion of bonus that is subject to deferral into shares was structured in a complex manner with the proportion of deferral rising as the size of the bonus outturn increases.
To address these issues the Executive Directors ongoing bonus opportunity will be structured as follows To simplify the plan the concept of separate  core and  outperformance awards will be removed and replaced by an overall maximum bonus opportunity of 125% of salary i. increase on the current level.
Significant outperformance will still be required for a bonus approaching 125% of salary to be earned.
To further assist in simplification and to also bring the bonus plan more into line with typical practice the 10% interim bonus feature will be removed.
Therefore going forward the Executive Directors entire bonus opportunity will be based on full year performance.
Flexibility will be reserved to employ a broader range of financial and nonfinancial metrics in the bonus thereby reflecting common practice and also ensuring that the bonus outturn is based on a more rounded assessment of overall performance.
More specifically for 2017 18 A bonus of up to 105% of salary i.
84% of the maximum bonus will be payable based on performance against a sliding scale of financial targets namely adjusted PBT 80% of salary and recurring revenue 25% of salary both important financial KPIs.
A bonus of up to 20% of salary i.
16% of the maximum bonus will be payable by reference to performance against quantifiable personalstrategic targets details of performance against which will be retrospectively disclosed.
However to ensure affordability this element of the bonus will be reduced by 50% if a threshold level of PBT is not delivered.
Again in the interests of simplification a straight 40% of any bonus earned will be deferred into shares which vest as per the current policy in equal tranches over a threeyear deferral period.
The existing malus and clawback provisions will be retained with the Committee also reserving the right to adjust the bonus outturn based on a formulaic assessment of performance against the targets if this outturn does not reflect shareholders expectations.
Longterm incentives How AVEVA can best structure its longterm equitybased pay policy has been a key issue addressed by the Committee during the policy review process.
The Committee considers it vital that the interests of our senior management team are genuinely aligned with the longterm interests of our shareholders.
In previous years L TIPs were awarded at up to 150% of salary and were based solely on a single performance metric namely EPS growth.
The new policy achieves two main changes to the structure of the L TIPs first to use a blend of metrics to assess performance under the L TIP to provide a more rounded assessment of performance and secondly to introduce the facility to GOVERNANCE REPORT replace a portion worth 75% of salary of the traditional L TIPs with restricted share plan awards of a lower quantum worth 35% of salary.
For 2017 18 and onwards it is currently envisaged that awards will be structured as follows Traditional LTIPs Regular annual L TIP awards continue to be granted albeit at a reduced quantum of 75% of salary reflecting any grant of restricted share awards.
These awards vest subject to the satisfaction of challenging targets measured over a period of not less than three years as previously.
For awards made in 2017 18 the targets will be structured as follows 50% of the award will be subject to a sliding scale of adjusted EPS growth targets maintaining the threshold and maximum targets of 5% and 15% per annum used for last years awards but  to reflect internal and external forecasts which suggest continuing potential headwinds in AVEVAs end markets with the addition of an intervening target of 10% so that this element of the award vests as per the following table Adjusted EPS growth targets p.
Proportion of vesting % of total award 5% 25% 10% 80% 15% 100% 25% of the award will vest based on AVEVAs relative TSR performance against the FTSE 250 excluding Investment Trusts Financial Services and Real Estate sector companies.
25% of this element will vest at median with full vesting at the upper quartile.
The remaining 25% of the award will vest based on performance against a sliding scale of revenue growth targets that have been developed to specifically support AVEVAs growth strategy in certain parts of its business.
Due to commercial sensitivity the Committee does not believe it to be in shareholders interests to prospectively disclose details of the revenue growth targets.
However they will be objectively measurable over a threeyear period significant outperformance will be required to deliver full vesting the targets will be disclosed retrospectively following vesting and vesting will only occur if the Committee is satisfied that the Companys underlying financial performance warrants such payment.
25% of this element for each revenue target will vest at threshold levels of performance with full vesting at maximum achievement.
The revenue growth criteria are as follows Half of this portion i.
12.5% of the total L TIP award will vest based on performance against a sliding scale of targets relating to threeyear growth in revenue from Owner Operators OOs.
Revenue growth from OOs is an important strategic measure for the Group as this will supplement the revenue streams already derived from Engineering Procurement and Construction contractors EPCs.
Therefore it is important that we build these key relationships in order to protect and develop our existing business.
The remaining half of this portion i.
12.5% of the total L TIP award will vest based on performance against a sliding scale of targets relating to threeyear revenue growth in More than 3D .
Historically AVEVAs core strength has been in 3D engineering and design software.
We wish to continue to expand our product portfolio so as to be able to offer a wider solution to customers.
This is an important source of growth because we have an installed base that is still relatively unpenetrated in terms of the wider product portfolio.
In addition we can offer prospects a more complete integrated solution which helps drive efficiency.
Restricted Share Plan RSP Restricted share plan awards can be granted over shares worth up to 35% of salary i. to 75% of salary.
Should restricted plan awards be granted the shareholding guidelines will be increased to 300% of annual salary for both CEO and CFO previously 200% and 100% respectively.
As is the case with the traditional L TIPs restricted shares will be subject to a threeyear vesting period followed by a twoyear post vesting holding period.
In the event of a change in control awards vest subject to prorating unless the Committee determines otherwise.
Malus and clawback provisions would apply to this award as they will to the L TIP awards and awards would only be made if the Committee is satisfied that the Executives performance is satisfactory.
The Committee will withhold the award if there is no bonus achievement.
When agreeing on the introduction of a modest restricted shares element to our remuneration policy the Committee concluded that Restricted shares provide a genuinely meaningful and tangible interest in shares.
While a wholesale move to restricted shares with a complete cessation of the L TIP was an alternative approach it remained appropriate for a significant portion of our Executive Directors equity pay to remain directly linked to the achievement of challenging performance conditions thereby ensuring that the Executive Directors remain accountable to shareholders for their performance.
Introducing a restricted share plan addresses the continuing debate surrounding overall levels of Executive remuneration head on as the impact of a grant of restricted shares at 35% of salary and corresponding reduction in L TIP awards by 75% of salary would reduce the maximum value of our Executive Directors longterm incentive opportunity by 40% of salary in face value terms.
Indeed
L TIP to restricted shares exchange rate by replacing a 75% of salary L TIP opportunity with a 35% of salary restricted share award i. accepted 21 exchange rate.
While the introduction of restricted shares could potentially be viewed as adding complexity to our pay arrangements their introduction has been balanced by a significant simplification of the structure of our annual bonus plan which retains the large deferred share element further evidence of our commitment to equitybased pay and the alignment with shareholders that this brings.
AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
Restricted shares are a new development for Executive remuneration and their introduction has attracted mixed views amongst the investment community.
Accordingly the Committee has decided to introduce restricted shares as a supplement to the L TIP rather than supplant it.
The use of restricted shares for the Executive Directors would align with the structure of equity incentives throughout the wider management population where restricted shares have been used in tandem with LTIP awards for some years without any concerns arising regarding complexity.
Therefore by i the introduction of a limited restricted share plan ii the continuation of the L TIP  at greatly reduced levels when made in tandem with restricted shares with targets that encourage a reward for the delivery of performance across a broader range of metrics and iii the retention of the deferred share element of the bonus AVEVA will have a well thoughtout and rounded equitybased remuneration programme that is tailored to our specific circumstances and which provides both internal and external alignment.
The enhanced share ownership guidelines and use of twoyear postvesting holding periods also clearly assist in this regard.
Other Committee activities during the year In addition to conducting the policy review the Committee undertook a number of other activities during and relating to 201617  including Agreeing the packages of James Kidd David Ward and Richard Longdon following their respective changes in role.
Setting the 201617 bonus targets and determining the ultimate bonus outturn.
Full details can be found on page 61.
Granting the 2016 L TIP awards further details of which can be found on page 62.
Determining the vesting of the 2014 L TIP .
Full details can be found on page 63.
Finally our review noted that some amendments to the rules of the L TIP are required to reflect standard market practice.
For example to further strengthen alignment between Executives and shareholders it is proposed that the L TIP be amended to enable the Committee to award an amount in cash or shares equal in value to any dividends that would have been paid on vested shares from the date of grant to the date on which the award is released to the participant.
Certain other administrative amendments to the rules of the L TIP are also proposed to i formally reflect the introduction of the two year postvesting holding period that has applied to recent awards granted to Executive Directors ii ensure that the plan operates fairly where there is a variation of share capital and iii bring within the definition of a  change in control  which could be a vesting event  the situation whereby a third party that already has a controlling interest in AVEVA acquires the entire issued share capital of the Company.
We will be seeking shareholder approval for these changes at the AGM.
Summary
I hope you find the contents of this Report clear and are supportive of the approach we intend to adopt going forward.
We appreciate that the restricted share plan is as practice currently stands a relatively unusual feature.
With this in mind the Committee has included a number of safeguards that ensure our approach would be fully aligned with the long term interests of our shareholders The continuation of a significant share deferral element of the now simplified bonus.
Limiting the grant of restricted shares to 35% of salary with no award made in the event of underperformance as determined by the annual bonus objectives.
The continuation of L TIP awards with formal threeyear targets linked directly to our strategic objectives which will be lower than past awards in quantum terms to reflect an accompanying grant of restricted shares.
The application of a twoyear postvesting holding period for all awards.
The enhanced share ownership guidelines of 300% of salary should restricted share plan awards be made.
This approach was subject to an extensive prior consultation with our major shareholders who I am pleased to report were generally very supportive.
Part A of this report contains full details of the new policy in respect of which a binding shareholder resolution will be tabled at the forthcoming AGM.
An advisory resolution will also be tabled in connection with Part B of this report which explains how the existing policy was implemented last year.
Finally I shall be stepping down from the Chairmanship of the Remuneration Committee at the forthcoming AGM to be replaced by Jennifer Allerton who has been a member of the Remuneration Committee since 2013.
I wish her every success in her role as Chair of the Committee.
Philip Dayer Remuneration Committee Chairman GOVERNANCE REPORT PART A THE DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY This report sets out the information required by Part 4 of Schedule 8 to the Large and MediumSized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 as amended the Regulations.
The report also satisfies the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority and describes how the Board has applied the principles and complied with the provisions relating to Directors remuneration in the UK Corporate Governance Code.
The table below summarises the Committees future policy on the remuneration of Executive Directors which if approved by shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting on 7 July 2017  will replace the existing policy for which shareholder approval was obtained at the 2014 Annual General Meeting and will become binding immediately thereafter.
The material differences between the existing and proposed new policy which has also been designed with due account taken of the UK Corporate Governance Code are explained in the statement by the Committee Chairman and also in the table below.
It is currently intended that the policy will remain valid until the 2020 Annual General Meeting.
The Remuneration Committee aims to ensure that the Executive Directors are provided with appropriate incentives to align them with the achievement of the Companys longterm strategy and the future creation of shareholder value enhanced performance is encouraged and the Executive Directors are in a fair and responsible manner rewarded for their individual contributions to the success of the Group.
Excessive risktaking is neither encouraged nor rewarded.
It also aims for a combination of fixed and variable payments benefits and sharebased awards that will achieve a balance in incentives to deliver short and longterm goals.
The Companys policy is that a substantial proportion of remuneration of Executive Directors should be performancerelated and should be delivered in shares to create alignment with shareholders interests.
Remuneration for Executive Directors is set in the context of the economic environment in which the Group operates the outcome of the wider pay review for all Group employees as well as the financial performance of the Group.
When determining remuneration arrangements the Committee takes into consideration relevant external considerations as well as the remuneration for employees of the Group generally.
Remuneration commitments made which were consistent with the approved Remuneration Policy in force at that time shall be honoured even if they would not otherwise be consistent with the policy prevailing when the commitment is fulfilled.

Base salary is normally reviewed annually with changes effective from 1 April although salaries may be reviewed more frequently or at different times of the year if the Committee determines this is appropriate.
The Committee determines base salary taking into account factors including but not limited to the individuals role experience and performance in achieving financial and nonfinancial goals within his areas of responsibility. technology peers. employees within the Company. total organisational salary budgets.
The Committee takes a phased approach to new salaries where appropriate.
Paid in cash.
In determining salary increases the Committee generally considers the factors outlined in the  operation column.
Salary increases will normally be in line with the range of increases in the broader workforce salary although higher increases can be made in certain circumstances for example an increase in the individuals scope of responsibilities in the case of Executive Directors who are positioned on a lower initial salary while they gain experience in the role or where the Committee considers that salary is behind appropriate market positioning for a company of AVEVAs size and complexity.
However no salary increase will be paid to an incumbent the effect of which is that the increased salary is greater than 600000.

In line with benefits provided for other senior employees in the Group Executive Directors currently receive a mobility allowance or company car a fuel allowance and an annual allowance toward a range of benefits.
In the event that an Executive Director was required to relocate to undertake their role the Committee may provide additional benefits to reflect the relevant circumstances on a oneoff or ongoing basis.
Benefits are reviewed by the Committee in the context of market practice from time to time and the Committee may introduce or remove particular benefits if it is considered appropriate to do so.
If the Company were to operate an allemployee share plan in the future Executive Directors would be entitled to participate in the plan on the same terms as other employees.
The cost of benefit provision will depend on the cost to the Company of providing individual items and the individuals circumstances.
However the addition of further benefits than those already provided excluding relocationrecruitmentrelated benefits and participation in any allemployee share plan will not result in the aggregate benefit provision for any Executive Director increasing to over 50000.

Annual Incentive Scheme Incentivises and rewards the achievement of annual financial and strategic business targets and delivery of personal objectives.
Deferred element encourages longterm shareholding helps retention and discourages excessive risktaking.
The Committee determines an individuals maximum incentive opportunity taking into account the responsibilities of the role and market practice at comparable companies.
Performance targets are set by the Committee on an annual basis and ordinarily disclosed retrospectively.
The Committee determines the level of bonus paid taking into account performance against targets the underlying performance of the business and Executive Directors performance during the year.
40% of any bonus earned is deferred into shares under the Deferred Share Scheme to which malusclawback provisions apply The maximum bonus opportunity is 125% of base salary.
The performance measures applied may be financial or nonfinancial and corporate divisional or individual and in such proportions as the Committee considers appropriate.
Where a sliding scale of targets is used attaining the threshold level of performance for any measure will not typically produce a payout of more than 20% of the maximum portion of overall annual bonus attributable to that measure with a sliding scale to full payout for maximum performance.
However the annual bonus plan remains a discretionary arrangement and the Committee retains a standard power to apply its judgement to adjust the outcome of the annual bonus plan for any performance measure should it consider that to be appropriate e. shareholder expectations.

Other elements of remuneration are not subject to malus or clawback.

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
Stating maximum amounts for the Directors Remuneration Policy The Regulations and related investor guidance encourages companies to disclose a cap within which each element of the Directors Remuneration Policy will operate.
Where maximum amounts for elements of remuneration have been set within the Directors Remuneration Policy these will operate simply as caps and are not indicative of any aspiration.
Travel and hospitality While the Committee does not consider it to form part of benefits in the normal usage of that term it has been advised that corporate hospitality whether paid for by the Company or another and business travel for Directors and in exceptional circumstances their families may technically come within the applicable rules and so the Committee expressly reserves the right for the Committee to authorise such activities within its agreed policies.
Committee discretion The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office including the exercise of any discretions available to it in connection with such payments notwithstanding that they are not in line with the Policy set out above where the terms of the payment were agreed i before the Policy came into effect or ii at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company and in the opinion of the Committee the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company.
For these purposes payments include the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and an award over shares is agreed at the time the award is granted.
The Committee may operate the L TIP  the RSP  the annual bonus and the Deferred Share Scheme in accordance with their terms.
This includes The selection of participants The timing of grant of an awardbonus opportunity The size of an awardbonus opportunity subject to the maximum limits set out in the policy table The determination of performance against targets and resultant vestingbonus payouts Discretion required when dealing with a change of control or restructuring of the Group Determination of the treatment of leavers based on the rules of the plan and the appropriate treatment chosen Adjustments required in certain circumstances e.
The annual review of performance measures weightings and targets from yeartoyear.
In addition while performance measures and targets used in the annual bonus plan and L TIP will generally remain unaltered if events occur which in the Committees opinion would make a different or amended target a fairer measure of performance the Committee can make such amendments to the targets as it considers appropriate.
Any use of these discretions would where relevant be explained in the Remuneration Committee Report and may where appropriate and practicable be the subject of consultation with the Companys major shareholders.
In addition for the avoidance of doubt in approving this policy report authority is given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into with current or former Directors prior to the adoption of this policy.
The Committee may also make minor amendments to the Policy set out above for regulatory exchange control tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation without obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment.
Remuneration arrangements throughout the Group Throughout the Group remuneration is determined based on the same principles that remuneration arrangements should be appropriate for the role without paying more than is necessary and that pay should be structured to incentivise individuals to deliver the objectives of their role.
AVEVA employs over 1700 employees in over 30 locations with roles ranging from administrators to technical specialists and sales staff.
The structure and level of reward therefore differs from role to role depending on skills experience level of seniority and market practice for the role.
AVEVAs sales employees participate in commission plans that are designed to encourage the growth objectives of the Group.
Around 300 employees have annual bonus plans with 10 receiving a portion of bonus in shares which is deferred for up to three years all other employees are eligible for a Group Discretionary Award or similar subject primarily to the Groups financial performance and secondarily subject to individual performance.
The most senior management participate in the L TIP and RSP .
GOVERNANCE REPORT Selection of performance measures The Committees guiding principle is that remuneration arrangements that operate throughout the Group should support the delivery of our longterm business strategy and therefore the creation of shareholder value.
Our key longterm strategic priority is to deliver strong but sustainable profit streams to support the delivery of this strategic priority.
The metrics used in our annual bonus arrangements and L TIP are chosen with this in mind with the payment of bonuses and the vesting of longterm incentives subject to stretching targets established by the Committee at the beginning of each performance period.
These targets are set taking account of internal forecasts of performance over the performance period the markets in which the Group operates our longterm growth ambitions and the expectations of the investment community on the Groups future potential performance.
Remuneration Policy for new hires When determining the remuneration package for a newly appointed Executive Director the Committee would seek to apply the following principles The package should be market competitive to facilitate the recruitment of an individual of sufficient calibre to lead the business.
At the same time the Committee would intend to pay no more than it believes is necessary to secure the required talent.
The structure of the ongoing remuneration package would normally include the components set out in the policy table for Executive Directors.
Where an individual forfeits outstanding variable pay opportunities or contractual rights as a result of their appointment the Committee may offer compensatory payments or awards in such form as the Committee considers appropriate taking into account relevant factors which may include the form of awards expected value and vesting timeframe of forfeited opportunities.
When determining such buyouts the guiding principle would be that awards would generally be on a like for like basis to those forfeited unless not considered appropriate.
To facilitate awards outlined above in the event of recruitment the Committee may grant awards to a new Executive Director in accordance with Listing Rule 9.4.2.
This provision permits the granting of awards to facilitate in unusual circumstances the recruitment of an Executive Director without seeking prior shareholder approval.
The maximum level of variable remuneration which may be awarded excluding any buyout awards is in accordance with limits on the Companys incentive plans as set out in the policy table.
Where an Executive Director is required to relocate to takeup their role the Committee may provide reasonable assistance with relocation either via oneoff or ongoing payments or benefits taking into account the individuals circumstances and prevailing market practice.
In the event that an internal candidate is promoted to the Board legacy terms and conditions would normally be honoured including pension entitlements and any outstanding incentive awards.
Executive Director service contracts and policy on payment for loss of office When determining leaving arrangements for an Executive Director the Committee takes into account any contractual agreements including the provisions of any incentive arrangements typical market practice and the performance and conduct of the individual.
The service contracts for current and noncurrent Executive Directors include the following terms Name Date of Contract Date of Appointment Continuous Service Date Current Executive Directors James Kidd 17 February 2017 1 January 2017 5 January 2004 David Ward 19 July 2016 8 July 2016 17 January 2011 Noncurrent Executive Directors Richard Longdon 8 July 2010 16 August 1994 29 May 1984 AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

Other payments An Executive Director who joined the Company before January 2008 and who is made redundant may receive in addition to a payment in lieu of notice any statutory redundancy payment and any other payment to which he is entitled a payment under the Companys enhanced redundancy policy.
This policy applies to all employees who joined the Company before January 2008.
Under the policy an eligible person will receive a payment calculated by reference to their length of service and weekly pay by reference to gross annual salary as follows 7 weeks pay for service of up to 6 years plus 1.5 weeks pay for each completed year of service over 7 years up to 20 years plus 2 weeks pay for each completed year of service over 20 years.
Under the Companys enhanced redundancy policy eligible participants including Executive Directors may also receive a payment in lieu of a 90 day redundancy consultation period.
In the event of termination of an Executive Directors employment a payment may be made in lieu of any accrued but untaken holiday.
The Remuneration Committee would be responsible for considering the circumstances of the early termination of an Executive Directors contract and determining whether in exceptional circumstances there should be compensation payments in excess of the Companys contractual obligations.
The Company has the power to enter into settlement agreements with Directors and to pay compensation to settle potential legal claims.
In addition and consistent with market practice in the event of the termination of an Executive Director the Company may make a contribution towards that individuals legal fees and fees for outplacement services as part of a negotiated settlement.
Any such fees will be disclosed as part of the detail of termination arrangements.
For the avoidance of doubt the policy does not include an explicit cap on the cost of termination payments.
GOVERNANCE REPORT Change of control In the event of a change of control or a voluntary windingup of the Company and ultimately at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee Unvested awards under the Deferred Share Scheme will vest in full at the time of change of control.
Unvested awards granted under the 2014 L TIP rules will vest having regard to the extent to which performance conditions have been met and unless the Committee determines otherwise the proportion of the performance period that has elapsed at the date of the change of control or windingup.
Unvested awards granted under the Restricted Share Plan shall vest in proportion to the full vesting period which has elapsed as at the date of change of control.
Employee context When setting Executive Directors pay the Committee considers the remuneration arrangement of other senior managers and employees in the Group more generally to ensure that Executive remuneration arrangements are appropriate in this context.
AVEVA undertakes an annual salary review in April each year and uses this opportunity to reward strong performance and ensure salaries are in line with market rates.
It manages this in a competitive environment particularly in the fastgrowing economic areas.
When determining salary increases for Executive Directors the Committee considers the outcome of the wider pay review for the Group.
The Committee does not consult directly with employees regarding Executive Directors remuneration.
However at regular intervals the Company conducts a survey of the views of employees in respect of their experience of working at AVEVA including their own reward.
Dialogue with shareholders The views of our shareholders on remuneration matters are important to the Committee and prior to making any material changes to remuneration arrangements the Committee consults with major shareholders and their representative bodies to obtain their views as was the case during the Policy renewal process.
The Company remains committed to engaging with shareholders in relation to remuneration issues.
External appointments The Companys policy is to permit an Executive Director to serve as a NonExecutive Director elsewhere when this does not conflict with the individuals duties to the Company and where an Executive Director takes such a role they may be entitled to retain any fees which they earn from that appointment.
Remuneration outcomes in different performance scenarios The remuneration package at AVEVA is structured so that the package rewards performance over both the short and long term to ensure that reward is aligned with shareholder value creation.

The half year element has been removed.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 The financial performance targets are based on 1 Group adjusted profit before tax PBT targets with a maximum weighting of 80% of salary and 2 recurring revenue with a maximum weighting of 25% of salary.
A further maximum of 20% of salary is available for the delivery of key individual performance objectives which are agreed with the Remuneration Committee at the start of each financial year although this element will be capped at a maximum achievement of 10% should the Group adjusted PBT target not be met.
The Board believes that given the annual incentive scheme rewards the achievement of the annual business plan the targets are market sensitive and therefore should not be disclosed in advance but ordinarily will be disclosed retrospectively.
As a simplification of the previous deferral calculation 40% of any award made under the Annual Incentive Scheme irrespective of the amount will be payable in deferred shares as per the policy table.
LongTerm Incentives As described in the introduction to the Remuneration Committee report it is currently proposed that the structure of the L TIs will change as summarised below Previous LTI arrangement New LTI arrangement Traditional LTIP 150% of salary 75% of salary EPS growth 150% of salary 37.5% of salary Relative TSR performance nil 18.75% of salary Strategic objectives nil 18.75% of salary Restricted Share Plan nil 35% of salary Total LongTerm Incentives 150% of salary 110% of salary Further details of the performance conditions are as follows The adjusted EPS growth targets are Adjusted EPS growth targets p.
Proportion of vesting % of total award 5% 25% 10% 80% 15% 100% The relative TSR performance condition will measure AVEVA against the FTSE 250 excluding Investment Trusts Financial Services and Real Estate sector companies.
25% of this element will vest at median with full vesting at the upper quartile.
The strategic objectives will be a sliding scale of revenue growth targets.
25% of this element for each revenue target will vest at threshold levels of performance with full vesting at maximum achievement.
The revenue growth criteria are as follows Half of this portion will vest based on performance against a sliding scale of targets relating to threeyear growth in revenue from Owner Operators OOs.
The remaining half of this portion will vest based on performance against a sliding scale of targets relating to threeyear revenue growth in More than 3D .
Due to commercial sensitivity the Committee does not believe it to be in shareholders interests to prospectively disclose details of the revenue growth targets.
However they will be objectively measurable over a threeyear period significant outperformance will be required to deliver full vesting the targets will be disclosed retrospectively following vesting and vesting will only occur if the Committee is satisfied that the Companys underlying financial performance warrants such payment.

James Kidds salary in 201617 was 306000 201516  300000 until his promotion to Deputy CEO in July 2016 when it increased to 350000 with a further increase to 400000 when he became CEO in January 2017 .
David Ward joined the Board as CFO on 8 July 2016 with a base salary of 230000.
Benefits
In 201617 and 201516 Executive Directors were provided with a company car or a car allowance a fuel allowance and a 500 annual allowance towards a range of flexible benefits.
From 1 January 2017  the annual allowance for flexible benefits increased for all UK employees including for the Executive Directors to 600 per annum.
Pension
James Kidd and David Ward are members of the AVEVA Group Personal Pension Plan a defined contribution scheme.
The
Company contributed 10% of salary to the plan during 201617 for David Ward.
In line with policy a cash alternative was paid to James Kidd.
Annual incentive This reflects the total annual incentive paid and payable in 2017 based on performance in the year ended 31 March 2017 .
This includes both the cash element of the bonus and the portion deferred into shares under the deferred share scheme.
The majority of the annual incentive is dependent on achieving Group adjusted profit before tax PBT performance targets.
10% of the core award was dependent on achieving the half year PBT target of 9.7m.
This was a binary target paying out either nothing or in full.
The actual achievement was 9.1m thereby resulting in no payout.
80% was dependent on full year adjusted PBT performance with nothing paying out if achievement was below 54.15m and fully paying out if achievement reached 62.70m.
The actual achievement was 55.0m.
This resulted in an achievement of 10.0% of the 80% PBT element representing 8% of scheme value.
The Executive Directors were given individual performance objectives which comprise the remaining 10% of the annual incentive.
When determining the level of achievement for this portion of the bonus the Committee considered that James Kidd had met this element having made some key appointments to his senior management team and introduced major organisational structure changes along with a new operating model and responsibility matrix to underpin these.
These changes will support the Company strategy in the future.
A clear business plan identifying the Companys strategic drivers and how these can be leveraged and measured has also been delivered.
The Committee considered David Wards targets as met as he has achieved specific tasks in the areas of risk management internal audit the adoption of IFRS 15 and AVEVAs commercial and contract function.

Change in remuneration of the CEO The table below illustrates the percentage change in salary benefits and annual incentive for the Group CEO and two selected subsets of employees including only those employees who were employed at the start of the 201516 financial year through to the end of the 201617 financial year.
The UK Group has been chosen because AVEVA is headquartered and employs around onequarter of its employees in the UK.
Typical salary inflation in some other AVEVA locations is materially higher than the UK which would distort the comparison.

AVEVA rebalanced the weighting of its interim and final dividend in 201617  increasing the proportion of the interim dividend by 117% over the prior year.
Outside appointments The Board believes that accepting NonExecutive appointments with other companies enhances the experience of Executive Directors and therefore they are entitled to accept appointments outside of the Company provided that Board approval is sought prior to accepting the appointment.
Whether or not the Director concerned is permitted to retain their fees is considered on a casebycase basis.
Neither James nor David currently hold any outside appointments.
Total pension entitlements Richard Longdon is a deferred member of the CADCentre Pension Scheme a defined benefit pension scheme for which AVEVA Solutions Ltd is the principal employer and has accrued the maximum benefit he is entitled to.

Overview of our audit approach Risks of material misstatement Risk of inappropriate revenue recognition on software licence contracts in particular for the rental revenue stream inappropriate application of the Group revenue recognition policy and IAS 18 Revenue for licence revenue recognition could result in for example revenue being recorded when performance conditions have not been satisfied incorrect deferral of revenue for support and maintenance and other obligations and for all revenue streams inappropriate revenue recognition in relation to cut off as revenue may not have been recognised in the correct accounting period.
Audit scope We performed an audit of the complete financial information of six components and audit procedures on specific balances for a further six components.
The components where we performed full or specific audit procedures accounted for 65% of adjusted pretax profit and 87% of revenue.
Materiality
Overall Group materiality of 2.5m which represents approximately 5% of adjusted pretax profit.
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF AVEVA GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Our assessment of risk of material misstatement We identified the risks of material misstatement described below as those that had the greatest effect on our overall audit strategy the allocation of resources in the audit and the direction of the efforts of the audit team.
In addressing these risks we have performed the procedures below which were designed in the context of the financial statements as a whole and consequently we do not express any opinion on these individual areas.
Risk
Risk of inappropriate revenue recognition on software licence contracts in particular For the rental revenue stream inappropriate application of the Group revenue recognition policy and IAS 18 Revenue for licence revenue recognition could result in for example revenue being recorded when performance conditions have not been satisfied incorrect deferral of revenue for support and maintenance and other obligations  94.2m 2016  90.6m.
For all revenue streams inappropriate revenue recognition in relation to cut off as revenue may not have been recognised in the correct accounting period  215.8m 2016  201.5m.
Refer to the Audit Committee Report pages 44 to 46 Accounting policies pages 113 to 120 and note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements page 84 Our response to the risk We have reviewed and walked through the central process over the approval and recognition of revenue contracts across the Group.
We have walked through and assessed the design effectiveness of key management controls over data input and IT.
A summary of our key procedures are We have performed rental licence revenue sample transaction testing at a local and Group level to ensure that revenue has been recorded in accordance with the Groups revenue recognition policy and IAS 18 and has been appropriately recorded in the current year income statement or deferred on the balance sheet as appropriate.
This was achieved by testing a sample of contracts by agreeing licence revenues to signed contracts or software licence agreements agreeing the revenue to subsequent payment as evidence of collectability checking evidence to support that software has been delivered to customers and prior to revenue recognition reviewing contract terms for any conditions that would impact the timing of revenue recognition and in turn the completeness of deferred revenue ensuring appropriate allocation of the fair value and recognition of revenue for other deliverables included within the contract and assessing whether revenue has been recognised in line with the Groups revenue recognition policy and IAS 18.
We selected a sample of revenue journals and assessed the appropriateness of the journal by checking to supporting evidence and ensuring compliance with the Groups revenue recognition policy and IAS 18.
The sample selected was based on risk based criteria including but not limited to manual journal entries those close to period end and postings that are inconsistent with roles and responsibilities.
We have performed an independent assessment as to whether the fair value rate of the support and maintenance is still applicable and that any nonstandard contracts have an appropriate fair value rate applied.
To better understand the nature of the contractual relationships with customers any contractual issues or any ongoing contractual obligations we made enquiries of management outside the finance function including the sales team and legal counsel to ensure that appropriate obligations and commitments had been recorded in the financial statements.
We have performed a test of detail on a sample of deferred revenue and accrued revenue items to ensure it is in accordance with the revenue recognition principles.
We have performed analytical review by revenue stream and geography to access unexpected trends and patterns that could be indicative of incorrect revenue recognition.
We have performed cutoff testing for a sample of revenue items booked either side of year end to ensure that licence revenue was only recognised for software in the period where the contract was signed by both AVEVA and the customer prior to year end and the software has been made available prior to the year end.
As a primary team we gained oversight of the testing performed by the overseas teams through Our review of their reporting deliverables where they are required to report on any exceptions identified from their testing and unusual contractual terms and conditions Reviewing contracts meeting the Board review threshold and Reviewing any contracts identified as having unusual terms or conditions by management andor overseas audit teams to confirm appropriate recognition of revenue in accordance with the contract accounting policy.
We performed full and specific scope audit procedures over this risk area in 12 locations which covered 87% of the risk amount.
At the Group level we also performed the same revenue procedures for the rest of the locations at Group materiality which covered the remaining 13% of the risk amount.
In addition the Group audit team performed these same procedures to Group materiality for the remaining components to ensure 100% coverage of revenue.
Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee We conclude that revenue recognised in the year and deferred as at 31 March 2017 is materially correct on the basis of our procedures performed both at Group and by component audit teams.
AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT CONTINUED
The scope of our audit Tailoring the scope Our assessment of audit risk our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for each entity within the Group.
Taken together this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
We take into account size risk profile the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of Groupwide controls and changes in the business environment when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage of significant accounts in the financial statements of the 30 reporting components of the Group we selected 12 components covering entities within the UK France Germany Korea USA Brazil India China and Sweden which represent the principal business units within the Group.
Of the 12 components selected we performed an audit of the complete financial information of six components full scope components which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics.
For the remaining six components specific scope components we performed audit procedures on specific accounts within that component that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the financial statements either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile.
The reporting components where we performed audit procedures accounted for 65% 2016  105% of the Groups adjusted pretax profit and 87% 2016  81% of the Groups
For the current year the full scope components contributed 66% 2016  57% of the Groups adjusted pretax profit and 75% 2016  52% of the Groups revenue.
The specific scope component contributed 1%  loss 2016  48% of the Groups adjusted pretax profit and 12% 2016  29% of the Groups Revenue.
The reduction in coverage for adjusted pretax profit is due to loss making components within the specific scope category.
The audit scope of these components may not have included testing of all significant accounts of the component but will have contributed to the coverage of significant testing for the Group.
At the Group level we performed the revenue audit procedures described above in the risk section at Group materiality on the rest of the components of the Group which accounted for the remaining 13% of the Groups revenue.
The Group audit risk in relation to revenue recognition was subject to audit procedures over the entire Group locations with revenue.
Of the remaining 18 components that together represent 35% of the Groups adjusted pretax profit none are individually greater than 5% of the Groups adjusted pretax profit.
For these components as explained above we performed the revenue procedures at Group materiality as described in the risk section and as a result covering 100% of revenue and for the remaining accounts we performed analytical review testing of consolidation journals intercompany elimination and foreign currency translation recalculation to respond to any potential risks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements.
The chart below illustrates the coverage obtained from the work performed by our audit teams.
Revenue
Full scope components 75% Specic scope components 12% Other procedures 13% Changes from the prior year USA has been designated a full scope component this year whereas it was designated as a specific scope location in the prior year.
We have changed the designation as a the component has increased in proportion of the total
For the current year we have scoped out Malaysia and Japan from the specific scope category and scoped in Sweden as part of our rotational scope for the smaller components of the Group.
Involvement with component teams In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the components by us as the primary audit engagement team or by component auditors from other EY global network firms operating under our instruction.
Of
In addition audit procedures were also performed by the primary audit team for one of the six specific scope components.
For the remaining eight components where the work was performed by component auditors we determined the appropriate level of involvement to enable us to determine that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group as a whole.
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits that has been designed to ensure that the Senior Statutory Auditor visits and his representatives visits at least two 2016  two of the components each year.
During the current years audit cycle visits were undertaken by the primary audit team to the component teams in China USA and France 2016 Germany and India.
These visits involved where appropriate discussing the audit approach with the component team and any issues arising from their work meeting with local and regional management attending the planning meeting in USA and the closing meetings in China and France and reviewing key audit working papers on risk areas.
The primary team interacted regularly with the component teams where appropriate during various stages of the audit reviewed key working papers and were responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process.
This together with the additional procedures performed at Group level gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the Group financial statements.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Starting basis Profit before tax  46.9m Adjustments Exceptional items  2.4m Materiality Adjusted pretax profit  49.3m Materiality of 2.5m 5% of materiality basis Our application of materiality We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in forming our audit opinion.
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that individually or in the aggregate could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements.
Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the Group to be 2.5 million 2016  2.2 million which is 5% 2016  5% of adjusted pretax profit because in our view this is the most relevant measure of the underlying financial performance of the Group.
For 2017 we have used pretax profit adjusted for restructuring costs 4.2m and the refund on consideration on the 8over8 acquisition from shareholders 1.8m.
For 2016 we used pretax profit adjusted for the aborted acquisition costs of Schneider Electric 10.2m and certain restructuring costs 3.8m.
Performance materiality The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level.
It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments together with our assessment of the Groups overall control environment our judgement was that performance materiality was 75% 2016  75% of our planning materiality namely 1.9m 2016  1.7m.
We have set performance materiality at this percentage to ensure that the total uncorrected and undetected audit differences in all accounts did not exceed our materiality.
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality.
The performance materiality set for each component is based on the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component.
In the current year the range of performance materiality allocated to components was 0.4m to 1.0m 2016  0.5m to 0.9m.
Reporting threshold An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of 0.12m 2016  0.11m which is set at 5% of planning materiality as well as differences below that threshold that in our view warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement whether caused by fraud or error.
This includes an assessment of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Groups and the Parent Companys circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
In addition we read all the financial and nonfinancial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on or materially inconsistent with the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit.
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 Corporate information AVEVA Group plc is a public limited Company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The address of the registered office is given on page 123.
AVEVA Group plcs shares are publicly traded on the Official List of the London Stock Exchange.
2 Key accounting policies Explained below are the key accounting policies of the Group.
The full Statement of Group Accounting Policies is included on pages 113 to 120.
The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017 .
The Consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling  and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand 000 except when otherwise indicated.
The Consolidated financial statements of AVEVA Group plc and all its subsidiaries the Group have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 March 2017 .
The Groups financial statements are also consistent with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.
The Group presents a nonGAAP performance measure on the face of the Consolidated income statement.
The Directors believe that the adjusted profit before tax and adjusted diluted and basic earnings per share measures presented provide a reliable and consistent presentation of the underlying performance of the Group.
Adjusted profit is not defined by IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable with the adjusted profit measures of other companies.
The business is managed and measured on a daytoday basis using adjusted results.
To arrive at adjusted results certain adjustments are made for normalised and exceptional items that are individually important and which could if included distort the understanding of the performance for the year and the comparability between periods.
Normalised items These are recurring items which management considers to have a distorting effect on the underlying results of the Group and are noncash items.
These items relate to amortisation of intangibles excluding other software sharebased payment charges and fair value adjustments on financial derivatives although other types of recurring items may arise.
Recurring items are adjusted each year irrespective of materiality to ensure consistent treatment.
Exceptional items These are items which are nonrecurring and are identified by virtue of either their size or their nature.
These items can include but are not restricted to the costs of significant restructuring exercises fees associated with business combinations and costs incurred in integrating acquired companies.
In the prior year deferred revenue was presented as part of the line item trade and other payables in the current year deferred revenue is presented as a separate line item on the balance sheet.
The prior year line item trade and other payables therefore decreased by the amount of deferred revenue of 46874000.
The parent Company financial statements of AVEVA Group plc are included on pages 107 to 111.
The Group generates its revenue principally from licensing the rights to use its software products directly to end users and to a lesser extent indirectly through resellers.
Revenue is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents the amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the ordinary course of business net of discounts and sales taxes.
It comprises initial licence fees annual licence fees and rental licence fees together with income from consultancy and other related services.
For each revenue stream revenue is not recognised unless and until a clear contractual arrangement can be evidenced delivery has been made in accordance with that contract if required contractual acceptance criteria have been met and the fee has been agreed and collectability is probable.
Where extended payment terms beyond 90 days exist appropriate approvals are obtained to ensure there is sufficient comfort that collectability is probable and the fee is determinable.
If approvals are not obtained revenue is deferred until payment is due.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Initialannual licence agreements Users are charged an initial licence fee upon installation for a set number of users together with an obligatory annual fee which is charged every year.
Annual fees consist of the continuing right to use and customer support and maintenance which includes core product upgrades and enhancements and remote support services.
Users must continue to pay annual fees in order to maintain the right to use the software.
Initial licence fees are recognised once the above conditions have been met.
Annual fees are recognised on a straightline basis over the period of the contract which is typically 12 months.
If annual fees are charged at a discount an amount is allocated out of the initial licence fee at fair market value based on the value established when annual fees are charged separately to customers.
Rental licence agreements As an alternative to the initial licence fee plus annual fee model the Group also supplies its software under three different types of rental licence agreement.
Rental licence fees which are invoiced monthly and which are cancellable by the customer are recognised on a monthly basis.
Other rental licence agreements are invoiced at the start of the contracted period which is typically one year are non cancellable and consist of two separate components the initial software delivery and the continuing right to use with customer support and maintenance.
Revenue in respect of the continuing right to use and customer support and maintenance element is valued at fair market value based on the value established when annual fees are charged separately to the customer.
This component is recognised on a straightline basis over the period of the contract.
The residual amount representing the implied initial fee element is recognised upfront provided all of the above criteria have been met.
Where uncertainty exists and it is not possible to reliably determine the fair value of the customer support and maintenance element all revenue is recognised on a straightline basis over the period of the contract.
The Group also licenses its software using a token licensing model.
Under this model a basket of tokens representing licences to use different software products over a defined period is granted which enables the customer to draw these down as and when required.
Where the customer commits in advance to a specified number of tokens over a defined period a proportion of revenue is recognised with an appropriate element deferred for customer support and maintenance obligations subject to the above recognition conditions being met.
Where the customer is charged in arrears revenue is recognised based on the actual number of tokens used.
Services
Services consist primarily of consultancy implementation services and training and are performed under separate service arrangements.
Revenue from these services is recognised as the services are performed and stage of completion is determined by reference to the costs incurred as a proportion of the total estimated costs of the service project.
If a contract cannot be reliably estimated revenue is recognised only to the extent that costs have been incurred.
Provision is made as soon as a loss is foreseen.
If an arrangement includes both licence and service elements licence fee revenue is recognised upon delivery of the software provided that services do not include significant customisation or modification of the base product and the payment terms for licences are not subject to acceptance criteria.
In all other cases revenues from both licence and service elements are recognised as services are performed.
Revenue recognition The assessments and estimates used by the Group for revenue recognition could have a significant impact on the amount and timing of revenue recognised.
Revenue from sales of software licences when these are combined with the delivery of significant implementation or customisation services is recognised in line with the delivery of the services to the customer.
This policy involves the assessment of which customer projects include significant customisation or implementation and also an assessment of the stage of completion of such projects.
The fair value estimate of the element of a customer rental fee attributable to the continuing right to use and to customer support and maintenance is reviewed periodically.
On average the element attributable to customer support and maintenance as a proportion of the initial software delivery is 17%.
A 1% deviation in this percentage would not lead to a material change in revenue.
AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2 Key accounting policies continued Provision for impairment of receivables The Group makes provision for the impairment of receivables on a customerspecific basis.
The determination of the appropriate level of provision involves an estimate of the potential risk of default or nonpayment by the Groups customers and management consider a number of factors including the financial strength of the customers the level of default that the Group has suffered in the past the age of the receivable outstanding and the Groups trading experience with that customer.
The provision for impairment of receivables at 31 March 2017 was 6054000 2016  5879000.
Intangible assets IFRS 3 requires the identification of acquired intangible assets as part of a business combination.
The methods used to value such intangible assets require the use of estimates including forecast performance and customer attrition rates.
Future results are impacted by the amortisation periods adopted and changes to the estimated useful lives would result in different effects on the income statement.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.
Tests for impairment are based on discounted cash flows and assumptions including discount rates timing and growth prospects which are inherently subjective.
Further details about the assumptions used are set out in note 14.
Retirement benefit obligations The determination of the Groups obligations and expense for defined benefit pensions is dependent on the selection by the Board of Directors of assumptions used by the pension scheme actuary in calculating these amounts.
The assumptions applied together with sensitivity analysis are described in note 25 and include amongst others the discount rate the inflation rate rates of increase in salaries and mortality rates.
While the Directors consider that the assumptions are appropriate significant differences in the actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the reported amount of the Groups future pension obligations actuarial gains and losses included in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income in future years and the future staff costs.
The net carrying amount of retirement benefit obligations at 31 March 2017 was 3810000 2016  5162000.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is allocated to cashgenerating units expected to benefit from the combinations synergies and represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and generates cash flows which are independent of other cashgenerating units.
The recoverable amount of the cashgenerating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstance indicate that it might be impaired.
The carrying values of property plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstance indicate the carrying value may be impaired.
If any such indication exists and where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount the assets or cashgenerating units are written down to their recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the greater of net selling price and value in use.
In assessing value in use the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows the recoverable amount is determined for the cashgenerating unit to which the asset belongs.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement in the selling and administrative expenses line item.

Also included are the redundancy costs incurred in eliminating the Regional Operations layer of management.
These activities are a continuation of the restructuring activities of the previous year which were ultimately more protracted than initially expected due to changes in the Executive management team.

Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the potentially dilutive share options into ordinary shares.
Details of the terms and conditions of share options are provided in note 26.

Goodwill impairment tests The following table shows the allocation of the carrying value of goodwill at the end of the year by cashgenerating unit.
Asia Pacific 20303 19446 EMEA 25377 24305 Americas 8625 7946 54305 51697 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated at acquisition to the cashgenerating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
In 201617 the goodwill impairment testing was carried out on a value in use VIU basis using the most recently approved management budgets for the year ended 31 March 2018 together with the most recent threeyear business plan extrapolated to a duration of five years in total.
Projected cash flows beyond five years have been assumed at the longterm growth rate for that region and these have been used to formulate a terminal value for the discounted cash flow calculation.
Key assumptions The key assumptions in the most recent annual budget on which the cash flow projections are based relate to discount rates longterm growth rates and operating margins.
The cash flow projections have been discounted using the Groups pretax weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the country and market risk.
Longterm growth rates used are assumed to be equal to the longterm growth rate in the gross domestic product of the region in which the CGU operates.
CGU operating margin is based on past results.
Discount rate Longterm growth ratetel 2016 Asia Pacific 12% 12% 2.0% 2.0% EMEA 11% 9% 1.9% 1.0% Americas 11% 11% 1.9% 2.0% Summary of results During the year all goodwill was tested for impairment with no impairment charge resulting 2016  nil.
As the VIU is most sensitive to a change in the discount rate and longterm growth rate the Directors have considered combinations of a reduction in the longterm growth rate and an increase in the discount rate and concluded that no reasonably foreseeable changes in key assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill such is the margin by which the estimate exceeds the carrying value.

These leases have a duration of between one and five years.
Certain property leases contain an option for renewal.
23 Financial risk management The Groups principal financial instruments comprise cash and shortterm deposits treasury deposits and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly from its operations.
The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to manage currency risks arising from the Groups operations.
It is and has been throughout the period under review the Groups policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are market risk credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing such risks on a regular basis as summarised below a Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect the Groups income or the value of its holding of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters.
Interest rate risk The Group holds net funds and hence its interest rate risk is associated with shortterm cash deposits and treasury deposits.
The Groups overall objective with respect to holding these deposits is to maintain a balance between security of funds accessibility and competitive rates of return.
For the presentation of market risks IFRS 7 requires sensitivity analysis that shows the effects of hypothetical changes of relevant risk variables on profit or loss and shareholders equity.
The Group is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on its cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposits.
The Group does not have any borrowings.
The impact is determined by applying sensitised interest rates to the cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposit balances.
A 1% point decrease in the Sterling and US Dollar interest rates would have reduced interest income by approximately 382000 2016  633000 and profit after tax by 306000 2016  506000.
Foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk arises from the Group undertaking a significant number of foreign currency transactions in the course of operations.
These exposures arise from sales by business units in currencies other than the Groups presentational currency of Sterling.
AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
23 Financial risk management continued The majority of costs are denominated in the functional currency of the business unit.
The main exposures relate to the US Dollar Euro South Korean Won and Japanese Y en reflecting the fact that a significant proportion of the Groups revenue and cash receipts are denominated in these currencies whilst a large proportion of its costs such as Research and Development are settled in Sterling Indian Rupees and Swedish Krona.
The Group manages exchange risks where possible by using forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to sell US Dollars and Euros to match forecast cash flows arising from its recurring revenue base.
In addition it enters into specific forward foreign exchange contracts for individually significant revenue contracts when the timing of forecast cash flows is reasonably certain.
Other currency exposures are less easy to hedge cost effectively.
At 31 March 2017  the Group had outstanding currency exchange contracts to sell 14.5 million 2016  18 million and 9.8 million 2016  10.4 million.
The Group has not applied hedge accounting during the current year and therefore all gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts have been included in the Consolidated income statement.
The Group has investments in foreign operations whose net assets are exposed to currency translation risk.
Gains and losses arising from these structural currency exposures are recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis For the presentation of market risks IFRS 7 requires sensitivity analysis that shows the effects of hypothetical changes in the foreign exchange rates in profit or loss or shareholders equity.
The impact is determined by applying the sensitised foreign exchange rate to the monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date.
Currency risks as defined by IFRS 7 arise on account of financial instruments being denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency and being of a monetary nature differences resulting from the translation of financial statements into the Groups presentation currency are not taken into consideration.
A 10% change in the US Dollar against Sterling and Euro against Sterling would have impacted equity and profit after tax by the amounts shown below as at the reporting date shown.
In managements opinion this is a reasonably possible change given current market conditions.
Our analysis indicates that a 10% change in other currencies would not have a significant impact.
This analysis assumes that all other variables in particular interest rates and other foreign currencies remain constant.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 201516.

Counterparties for cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposits are governed by the treasury policy which has been approved by the Board and are limited to financial institutions which have a high credit rating assigned by international credit rating agencies.
As set out in the Groups treasury policy the amount of exposure to each counterparty is subject to a specific limit up to a maximum of 50% of the Groups total counterparty risk.
Within this overall limit some counterparties are subject to more restrictive caps on counterparty exposure.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Group trades only with recognised creditworthy third parties and provides credit to customers in the normal course of business.
The amounts presented in the Consolidated balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which based on previous experience is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The Group has credit control functions to monitor receivable balances on an ongoing basis.
Credit checks are performed before credit is granted to new customers.
Due to the credit control procedures in place we believe all the receivables are of good quality.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk with exposure spread over a large number of customers.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset.
The exposure to credit risk is mitigated where necessary by either letters of credit or payments in advance.
The Group does not require collateral in respect of its financial assets.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity of financial assets and liabilities.
The Group has no borrowings from third parties and therefore liquidity risk is not considered a significant risk at this time.

23 Financial risk management continued d Fair values The book values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities consist of bank and cash balances of 85462000 2016 64611000 and treasury deposits of 45486000 2016  43316000.
The carrying amounts of these financial assets and liabilities in the Groups financial statements approximates their fair values.
In addition the Groups financial assets include forward foreign exchange contracts.
Financial instruments which are recognised at fair value subsequent to initial recognition are grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
The three levels are defined as follows Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly i. as prices or indirectly i. derived from prices.
Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
At 31 March 2017  the Group had forward foreign exchange contracts which were measured at Level 2 fair value subsequent to initial recognition.
The fair value of the liability in respect of foreign exchange contracts was 196000 at 31 March 2017 2016 864000 liability.
The resulting gain of 668000 2016  loss of 432000 on the movement of the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is recognised in the Consolidated income statement within administrative expenses.
The Groups policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor market creditor customer and employee confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The capital structure of the Group consists of equity attributable to the equity holders of AVEVA Group plc comprising issued share capital other reserves and retained earnings.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
No changes were made in the objectives policies or processes during the years ended 31 March 2016 or 2017 .
The Board monitors the capital structure on a regular basis and determines the level of annual dividend.
The Group is not exposed to any externally imposed capital requirements.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes Deferred tax liabilities 3381 3187 Deferred tax assets 3594 2617 At the balance sheet date the Group has unused tax losses of 8757 000 2016  7 005000 available for offset against future profits.
Of the total deferred tax asset of 2317 000 2016  1514000 844000 2016  933000 has been recognised and is included above.
These losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was approximately 46570000 2016  37 134000.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
It is likely that the majority of the overseas earnings would qualify for the UK dividend exemption but may be subject to foreign withholding taxes.

The Trustees may not distribute any surplus without the agreement of the Group.
If such agreement is withheld the Trustees are required to repay any remaining funds to the Group.
The Group operates a UK defined benefit pension plan providing benefits based on final pensionable pay which is funded.

The scheme closed to future benefit accrual with effect from 1 April 2015.
Pensions are also payable to dependants on death.
Administration on behalf of the members is governed by a trust deed and the funds are held and managed by professional investment managers who are independent of the Group.
Contributions to the scheme are made in accordance with advice from an external professionally qualified actuary Broadstone Corporate Benefits Limited at rates which are calculated to be sufficient to meet the future liabilities of the scheme.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates.

Tribon Solutions GmbH operated an unfunded defined benefit scheme that provides benefits to three deferred members following an acquisition in 1992.
No current employees participate in the scheme and it is closed to new applicants.
Benefit payments are made as they fall due.
The scheme was transferred to AVEVA GmbH when Tribon Solutions GmbH and AVEVA GmbH merged in 2005.
Since the acquisition of Bocad in May 2012 AVEVA Software GmbH had been responsible for the pension obligations of six former Bocad employees.
At the time of the acquisition the pension obligations were only partly financed via external funding vehicles.
In March 2013 AVEVA concluded an agreement with an external insurance provider which resulted in the insurance company being obliged to provide all benefits as detailed in the individual pension commitments with AVEVA only having an obligation if the external insurance provider defaults.
In addition AVEVA GmbH operates a defined benefit pension scheme for one employee.
This scheme is closed to new members.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Corporate information AVEVA Group plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The address of the registered office is given on page 123.
AVEVA Group plcs shares are publicly traded on the Official List of the London Stock Exchange.
Basis of preparation The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017 .
The Consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling  and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand 000 except when otherwise indicated.
The Group presents a nonGAAP performance measure on the face of the Consolidated income statement.
The Directors believe that the adjusted profit before tax and adjusted diluted and basic earnings per share measures presented provide a reliable and consistent presentation of the underlying performance of the Group.
Adjusted profit is not defined by IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable with the adjusted profit measures of other companies.
The business is managed and measured on a daytoday basis using adjusted results.
To arrive at adjusted results certain adjustments are made for normalised and exceptional items that are individually important and which could if included distort the understanding of the performance for the year and the comparability between periods.
Normalised items These are recurring items which management considers to have a distorting effect on the underlying results of the Group and are noncash items.
These items relate to amortisation of intangibles excluding other software sharebased payment charges and fair value adjustments on financial derivatives although other types of recurring items may arise.
Recurring items are adjusted each year irrespective of materiality to ensure consistent treatment.
Exceptional items These are items which are nonrecurring and are identified by virtue of either their size or their nature.
These items can include but are not restricted to the costs of significant restructuring exercises fees associated with business combinations and costs incurred in integrating acquired companies.
In the prior year deferred revenue was presented as part of the line item trade and other payables in the current year deferred revenue is presented as a separate line item on the balance sheet.
The prior year item trade and other payables therefore decreased by the amount of deferred revenue of 46874000.
Statement of compliance The Consolidated financial statements of AVEVA Group plc and all its subsidiaries the Group have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 March 2017 .
The Groups financial statements are also consistent with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.
The parent Company financial statements of AVEVA Group plc have been prepared under the FRS 101 reduced disclosure framework and are included on pages 107 to 111.
Basis of consolidation The Consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of AVEVA Group plc and its subsidiaries as at 31 March each year.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared using existing GAAP for each country of operation.
Adjustments are made to translate any differences that may exist between the respective local GAAP and IFRSs.
Intercompany balances and transactions including unrealised profits arising from intraGroup transactions have been eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is obtained by the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
On acquisition assets and liabilities of subsidiaries are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition with any excess of the cost of acquisition over this value being capitalised as goodwill.
Adoption of new and revised standards The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year.
New standards and interpretations which came into force during the year did not have a significant impact on the Groups financial statements.
STATEMENT OF GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 STATEMENT OF GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES
New standards and interpretations not yet effective The IASB have issued the following standards although in some cases not yet adopted by the EU which are expected to have implications for the reporting of the financial position or performance of the Group or which will require additional disclosures in future financial years Effective for periods commencing after IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2018 IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019 IFRS 2 Amendments  Classification and Measurement of Sharebased payment transactions IAS 7 Amendments  Disclosure initiative IAS 12 Amendments  Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for unrealised losses IFRS 10 and IAS 28 Amendments  Sales or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture 1 January 2019 The Group intends to adopt these standards in the first accounting period after the effective date.
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group in future periods except as noted below IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 prescribes a principlesbased approach to accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers as well as additional reporting disclosures.
The standard supersedes IAS 18 Revenue IAS 11 Construction Contracts and several revenue related interpretations.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers outlines a single comprehensive fivestep model to account for how revenue as goods or services are transferred to customers.
Furthermore it provides new guidance on whether revenue should be recognised at a point in time or over time and more specifically includes guidance on revenue from licensing arrangements.
IFRS 15 must be applied for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
It is endorsed by the EU except for the Clarifications to IFRS 15 issued by the IASB in April 2016.
The Company plans to adopt IFRS 15 in its consolidated financial statements for the year ending 31 March 2019 using the full retrospective approach.
The Company has completed an initial assessment of the potential impact of the adoption of IFRS 15 on its consolidated financial statements.
The main aspects of the assessment are outlined below i Rendering of services  transfer of control Revenue from sales of initial licences and the initial software delivery element of rental licences is currently recognised upon delivery.
Delivery occurs when the customer has access to the intellectual property described in the contract.
In some limited circumstances under the current policy AVEVA may recognise revenue from a licence agreement rateably over the contract period.
This assessment is based on whether AVEVA can reliably estimate the maintenance and support element of the contract.
Under IFRS 15 revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of the services.
All distinct performance obligations relating to licences for software are transferred to the customer at a point in time .
Therefore under IFRS 15 all revenue from software licences which are distinct performance obligations will be recognised at a point in time and not  over time .
Based on the initial assessment and in the absence of an uptake in AVEVAs Cloud offerings the Company does not anticipate material differences between the current policy and the requirement under IFRS 15 to recognise software licences at a point in time .
Revenue from contracts with separatelyidentifiable components multipleelement arrangements are currently recognised based on the relative fair value of the components.
Under IFRS 15 the total consideration of a customer arrangement will be allocated based on their relative standalone selling prices.
Standalone selling prices are determined based on list prices with standard discounts where appropriate the adjusted market assessment approach and the residual approach.
The Company has performed an initial comparison of the fair value approach under IAS 18 and the standalone selling prices under IFRS 15.
Based on the initial assessment these amounts are broadly the same therefore the Company at this stage does not anticipate material differences in the revenue recognition based on standalone selling prices.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS iii Providing extended payment terms to customers Under IAS 18 where AVEVA provides a customer with extended payment terms the revenue is deferred until the consideration is due in accordance with the contract.
Under IFRS 15 all the contractual payments are included in the transaction price and allocated to the performance obligations at the start of the contract.
Based on the initial assessment the Company has identified a potential impact on revenues for a limited number of contracts which under IFRS 15 could be recognised in the Income Statement at an earlier point in time rather than deferring recognition until the stage payments are invoiced.
The Company is currently performing a detailed analysis on a contractbycontract basis to assess the related impact.
IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 Leases effective for the year ending 31 March 2020 not yet endorsed by the EU will require all leases to be recognised on the balance sheet.
Currently IAS 17 Leases only requires leases categorised as finance leases to be recognised on the balance sheet with leases categorised as operating leases not recognised.
Lessees will recognise a right of use asset and a corresponding liability on the balance sheet.
The asset will be amortised over the length of the lease and the liability measured at amortised cost.
It is currently not practicable to quantify the effect at the date of the publication of these financial statements.
Existing operating lease commitments are set out in note 22.
Beyond the information above it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed review has been completed.
Significant accounting estimates The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below Retirement benefit obligations The determination of the Groups obligations and expense for defined benefit pensions is dependent on the selection by the Board of Directors of assumptions used by the pension scheme actuary in calculating these amounts.
The assumptions applied together with sensitivity analysis are described in note 25 and include amongst others the discount rate the inflation rate rates of increase in salaries and mortality rates.
While the Directors consider that the assumptions are appropriate significant differences in the actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the reported amount of the Groups future pension obligations actuarial gains and losses included in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income in future years and the future staff costs.
The net carrying amount of retirement benefit obligations at 31 March 2017 was 3810000 2016  5162000.
This year for the first time there is also a net surplus on the UK defined benefit scheme of 1222000 2016  nil.
Provision for impairment of receivables The Group makes provision for the impairment of receivables on a customerspecific basis.
The determination of the appropriate level of provision involves an estimate of the potential risk of default or nonpayment by the Groups customers and management consider a number of factors including the financial strength of the customers the level of default that the Group has suffered in the past the age of the receivable outstanding and the Groups trading experience with that customer.
The provision for impairment of receivables at 31 March 2017 was 6054000 2016  5879000.
Revenue recognition The assessments and estimates used by the Group for revenue recognition could have a significant impact on the amount and timing of revenue recognised.
Revenue from sales of software licences when these are combined with the delivery of significant implementation or customisation services is recognised in line with the delivery of the services to the customer.
This policy involves the assessment of which customer projects include significant customisation or implementation and also an assessment of the stage of completion of such projects.
The fair value estimate of the element of a customer rental fee attributable to the continuing right to use and to customer support and maintenance is reviewed periodically.
On average the element attributable to customer support and maintenance as a proportion of the initial software delivery is 17%.
A 1% deviation in this percentage would not lead to a material change in revenue.
AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 STATEMENT OF GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Intangible assets IFRS 3 requires the identification of acquired intangible assets as part of a business combination.
The methods used to value such intangible assets require the use of estimates including forecast performance and customer attrition rates.
Future results are impacted by the amortisation periods adopted and changes to the estimated useful lives would result in different effects on the income statement.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.
Tests for impairment are based on discounted cash flows and assumptions including discount rates timing and growth prospects which are inherently subjective.
Further details about the assumptions used are set out in note 14.
Revenue
The Group generates its revenue principally from licensing the rights to use its software products directly to end users and to a lesser extent indirectly through resellers.
Revenue is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents the amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the ordinary course of business net of discounts and sales taxes.
It comprises initial licence fees annual fees and rental licence fees together with income from consultancy and other related services.
For each revenue stream revenue is not recognised unless and until a clear contractual arrangement can be evidenced delivery has been made in accordance with that contract if required contractual acceptance criteria have been met and the fee has been agreed and collectability is probable.
Where extended payment terms beyond 90 days exist appropriate approvals are obtained to ensure there is sufficient comfort that collectability is probable and the fee is determinable.
If approvals are not obtained revenue recognition is deferred until payment is due.
Initialannual licence agreements Users are charged an initial licence fee upon installation for a set number of users together with an obligatory annual fee which is charged every year.
Annual fees consist of the continuing right to use and customer support and maintenance which includes core product upgrades and enhancements and remote support services.
Users must continue to pay annual fees in order to maintain the right to use the software.
Initial licence fees are recognised once the above conditions have been met.
Annual fees are recognised on a straightline basis over the period of the contract which is typically 12 months.
If annual fees are charged at a discount an amount is allocated out of the initial licence fee at fair market value based on the value established when annual fees are charged separately to customers.
Rental licence agreements As an alternative to the initial licence fee plus annual fee model the Group also supplies its software under three different types of rental licence agreement.
Rental licence fees which are invoiced monthly and which are cancellable by the customer are recognised on a monthly basis.
Other rental licence agreements are invoiced at the start of the contracted period which is typically one year are non cancellable and consist of two separate components the initial software delivery and the continuing right to use with customer support and maintenance.
Revenue in respect of the continuing right to use and customer support and maintenance element is valued at fair market value based on the value established when annual fees are charged separately to the customer.
This component is recognised on a straightline basis over the period of the contract.
The residual amount representing the implied initial fee element is recognised upfront provided all of the above criteria have been met.
Where uncertainty exists and it is not possible to reliably determine the fair value of the customer support and maintenance element all revenue is recognised on a straightline basis over the period of the contract.
The Group also licenses its software using a token licensing model.
Under this model a basket of tokens representing licences to use different software products over a defined period is granted which enables the customer to draw these down as and when required.
Where the customer commits in advance to a specified number of tokens over a defined period a proportion of revenue is recognised with an appropriate element deferred for customer support and maintenance obligations subject to the above recognition conditions being met.
Where the customer is charged in arrears revenue is recognised based on the actual number of tokens used.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Services consist primarily of consultancy implementation services and training and are performed under separate service arrangements.
Revenue from these services is recognised as the services are performed and stage of completion is determined by reference to the costs incurred as a proportion of the total estimated costs of the service project.
If a contract cannot be reliably estimated revenue is recognised only to the extent that costs have been incurred.
Provision is made as soon as a loss is foreseen.
If an arrangement includes both licence and service elements licence fee revenue is recognised upon delivery of the software provided that services do not include significant customisation or modification of the base product and the payment terms for licences are not subject to acceptance criteria.
In all other cases revenues from both licence and service elements are recognised as services are performed.
Foreign currencies The functional and presentational currency of AVEVA Group plc is Pounds Sterling .
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the functional currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All differences are taken to the Consolidated income statement.
Nonmonetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate as at the date of the initial transaction.
The subsidiaries have a number of different functional currencies.
As at the reporting date the assets and liabilities of these overseas subsidiaries are translated into Pounds Sterling  at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and their income statements are translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the year.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation are taken directly to the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Goodwill
Goodwill on acquisitions is initially measured at cost being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the acquirers interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets liabilities and contingent liabilities.
Following initial recognition goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Where goodwill forms part of a cashgenerating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation.
Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured on the basis of the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cashgenerating unit retained.
If the potential benefit of tax losses or other deferred tax assets does not satisfy the criteria in IFRS 3 for separate recognition when a business combination is initially accounted for but is subsequently realised the Group recognises the deferred tax income in the Consolidated income statement.
Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately are capitalised at cost and from a business acquisition are capitalised at fair value as at the date of acquisition.
Following initial recognition the cost model is applied to each class of intangible asset as set out below.
Expenditure on internally developed intangible assets excluding development costs is taken to the Consolidated income statement in the year in which it is incurred.
Internal software development expenditure is recognised as an intangible asset only after its technical feasibility and commercial viability can be demonstrated.
Useful lives are also examined on an annual basis and adjustments where applicable are made on a prospective basis.
Amortisation is calculated on a straightline basis over the estimated useful economic lives of the asset which are as follows
Developed technology 512 Customer relationships 520 Purchased brand 5 Other software 3 Purchased software rights 510 Research expenditure Research expenditure is written off in the year of expenditure.
AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 STATEMENT OF GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Government grants Grants in respect of specific Research and Development projects are recognised as receivable when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and the conditions to obtain them have been complied with.
They are credited to the income statement in the same period as the related Research and Development costs for which the grant is compensating.
The grant income is presented as a deduction from the related expense.
Property plant and equipment Property plant and equipment is stated at cost less depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is calculated on a straightline basis to write down the assets to their estimated residual value over the useful economic life of the asset as follows
Computer equipment 3 Fixtures fittings and office equipment 68 Motor vehicles 4 Leasehold buildings and improvements are amortised on a straightline basis over the period of the lease 3 to 49 years or useful economic life if shorter.
Impairment of assets Goodwill arising on acquisition is allocated to cashgenerating units expected to benefit from the combinations synergies and represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and generates cash flows which are independent of other cashgenerating units.
The recoverable amount of the cashgenerating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstance indicate that it might be impaired.
The carrying values of property plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstance indicate the carrying value may be impaired.
If any such indication exists and where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount the assets or cashgenerating units are written down to their recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the greater of net selling price and value in use.
In assessing value in use the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows the recoverable amount is determined for the cashgenerating unit to which the asset belongs.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement in the administrative expenses line item.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables which generally have 30 to 90 day terms are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written off when identified.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and shortterm deposits in the Consolidated balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and shortterm deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The carrying amount of these approximates their fair value.
For the purpose of the Consolidated cash flow statement cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Derivative financial instruments The only derivative financial instruments the Group holds are forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risk.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
All forward foreign exchange contracts have been markedtomarket and are held at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheet.
The
Group has not applied hedge accounting during the year and therefore movements in fair value are being recorded in the Consolidated income statement.
Fair value is estimated using the settlement rates prevailing at the period end.
Leases
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the Consolidated income statement on a straightline basis over the lease term.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Group is subject to income tax in numerous jurisdictions.
The Group recognises provisions for tax based on estimates of taxes that are likely to become due.
Where the final tax outcome is different from the amounts that were initially recorded such differences will impact the current income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determinations are made.
Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Legislation has been enacted to allow UK companies to elect for the Research and Development Expenditure Credit RDEC on qualifying expenditure incurred since 1 April 2013 instead of the superdeduction rules.
At the balance sheet date management has concluded that the election will be made and therefore the RDEC is recorded as income included in profit before tax netted against Research and Development expenses as the RDEC is of the nature of a government grant.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except where the deferred income tax liability arises from goodwill amortisation or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss and in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences carryforward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences carryforward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised except where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss and in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The income tax effects of items recorded in either other comprehensive income or equity are recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income or the Consolidated statement of changes in shareholders equity respectively.
Otherwise income tax is recognised in the Consolidated income statement.
Revenue expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales taxes except where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from the taxation authority in which case the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable and receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales taxes included.
The net amount of sales taxes recoverable from or payable to the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the Consolidated balance sheet.
Post retirement benefits The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes in the UK Sweden and Germany.
The Group also provides certain post employment benefits to its South Korean employees.
The UK defined benefit pension scheme previously available to all UK employees was closed to new applicants in 2002 and closed to future accrual from 31 March 2015.
UK employees are now offered membership of a defined contribution scheme.
AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 STATEMENT OF GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The German unfunded defined benefit schemes are closed to new applicants and provide benefits to nine deferred members.
These schemes were acquired as part of previous business combinations.
No current employees participate in the schemes.
Full provision has been made for the liability on the Consolidated balance sheet.
The Group also operates a defined benefit pension scheme for one German employee.
The Group provides pension arrangements to its Swedish employees through an industrywide defined benefit scheme.
It is not possible to identify the share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the scheme which is attributable to the Group on a fair and reasonable basis.
Therefore the Group has applied the provisions in IAS 19 to account for the scheme as if it was a defined contribution scheme.
For the defined benefit schemes the defined benefit obligation is calculated annually for each plan by qualified external actuaries using the projected unit credit method which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period to determine current service cost and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value of defined benefit obligation.
The retirement benefit liability in the Consolidated balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation using a discount rate derived from a published index of AA rated corporate bonds as reduced by the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly.
Fair value is based on market price information and in the case of quoted securities is the published bid price.
The value of a net pension benefit asset is restricted to the present value of any amount the Group expects to recover by way of refunds from the plan or reductions in the future contributions.
The current service cost is recognised in the Consolidated income statement as an employee benefit expense.
The net interest element of the defined benefit cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments or changes in actuarial assumptions are credited or charged in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
The Group also operates defined contribution pension schemes for a number of UK and nonUK employees.
Contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to profit before tax as they become payable.
Sharebased payments The cost of equitysettled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted further details of which are given in note 26.
The cost of equitysettled transactions is recognised together with a corresponding increase in equity over the period in which the performance conditions are fulfilled ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equitysettled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Groups best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equitysettled award are modified as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
In addition an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equitysettled award is cancelled it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
However if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award as described in the previous paragraph.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share subject to an estimate of whether performance conditions will be met.
