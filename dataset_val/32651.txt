Chairmans
Statement
Results and strategic progress Crawshaw Group has experienced a challenging year but once the causes of the declining likeforlike sales were established management made rapid changes that clearly resonated with customers.
As a result we have finished the year with some really encouraging sales and margin momentum.
As noted in our Interim Results during our period of rapid growth the number of proposition changes we asked customers to embrace and a combination of the well documented external factors caused a significant drop in the trading momentum of the core business from the end of H1 and start of H2.
The management team acted quickly and carefully to restore this momentum.
This was achieved with a programme of broader and deeper promotions and giving back the store managers more flexibility to trade their local shop to suit their local customers.
We are pleased with the recent improved trading performance and are very encouraged by the momentum that has been built up throughout H2 which was reflected in our Christmas T rading Update.
The level of sales performance in our likeforlike estate necessitated a reduction in the rate of new store openings to both free up management time to recover sales in the legacy estate and to maintain the strength of the balance sheet.
We opened 11 new stores in the year 9 in H1 and 2 in H2 and this takes the total organic growth so far to 17.
In the period one of our legacy market shops closed as part of a council town centre regeneration scheme resulting in an estate of 49 stores at 29 January 2017.
In the period under review the Group delivered total sales of 44.2m an increase of 19%.
This converted to an Adjusted EBITDA of 1.3m 2016 2.6m as lower sales and subsequent margin investment temporarily reduced the EBITDA generation of the legacy business.
The Group made a loss before tax of 1.4m 2016 loss of 0.3m.
Cash
The cash position of the business continues to be robust with 2.1m cash on hand at the yearend 2016 4.9m with the pace of new store rollout and levels of central resource all being balanced with maintaining a strong balance sheet.
The reduction in cash is entirely growth plan driven with 2.9m of capital expenditure invested in new stores in the year.
The cash generated from operations funded payment of the final dividend declared last year.
The performance of the business has now been stabilised having restored the level of sales and customer numbers
I have been very impressed by the way Noel and the management team have carefully but swiftly taken the appropriate corrective actions during this challenging period.
For this reason the performance of the business has now been stabilised having restored the level of sales and customer numbers respectively.
Coupled with the expected recovery in margin and the full benefit of the cost saving actions flowing through the business has returned to positive cash generation.
Crawshaw has demonstrated its ability to manage a major change agenda in parallel with evaluating the ongoing potential of our store rollout programme.
We therefore remain encouraged and confident in the scalability of the model and with the business returning to a cash generative position we look to continue with a disciplined opening programme.
As noted in our Interim Results of particular interest and significance is the strength of performance of our fresh meat factory shops.
Whilst we remain completely committed to the high street shopping centre and market location stores the factory shop concept is proving to deliver significantly better financial returns with its higher sales lower operating costs no hot foodtogo offer and lower fit out costs.
The two new factory shops that opened in the year have further demonstrated the success of the concept which has helped shape our thoughts for the rollout strategy for the year ahead.
And so our store rollout program will focus on this concept.
Since the end of the financial year the business has continued to improve with Group sales up 9% and LFL sales of 4.6% in the first ten weeks.
We have also signed the lease on another factory shop unit which we expect to be trading by the end of May and have a number of opportunities in the pipeline to open across the rest of this financial year.
The Board are committed to ensuring cash is available to fund the growth strategy and maintaining a strong balance sheet.
In line with this the Board has decided that no dividend payment will be made at this time Richard Rose
25 April 2017 T otal sales Sales growth full year 2016201 7 19% Trading performance highlights Crawshaw Group Plc Annual Report 52 weeks ended 29 January 201 7 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 03 Crawshaw Group Plc Annual Report 52 weeks ended 29 January 201 7 Chief Executive Officers Review Our managers and butchers continue to be the ambassadors of putting their customers at the heart of our local strategy Performance and operational review Whilst we made considerable progress in the year with the store rollout programme by adding a further 11 new stores to the estate we have been very disappointed by the likeforlike sales performance as some of the price and range initiatives didnt resonate with customers as we had expected.
In preparing the core business to be ready for accelerated expansion and creating the store rollout blue print we made a number of changes to standardise the new store concept on range price point how the stores were operated and how the stores looked.
These principles worked well for our new stores but when retrospectively introduced into our established stores we learned it was too much change for our customers and colleagues.
This was reflected in the shape of our sales performance during June and July at the end of H1.
As a result we prioritised our focus in the second half of the year to listening to colleagues and customers and the feedback from them was relatively straightforward.
Our customers wanted to see some of the old fresh meat pack sizes price points and offers that were previously on sale in their specific store.
This feedback was positioned at the heart of our sales recovery programme and helped shape the refinements we set about achieving to provide our managers with the necessary freedom within a framework plan to win back their local customers.
T o ensure that all areas of our business were completely focused on delivering the sales recovery programme effectively it was important to temporarily pause the store rollout programme and provide full support to our store colleagues.
During the implementation of our freedom within a framework plan we reviewed our head office organisation structure and removed a number of roles.
The changes were implemented responsibly giving us the central support structure for the year ahead.
Having successfully landed our major change agenda we now believe we have the right operational balance between the disciplined framework required as a platform for rollout with enough freedom for store managers to react to local customer requirements.
This positive progress has also been reflected in the shape and momentum build of our sales performance in the lead up to and through the key festive trading period at the end of H2.
In summary we have seen a direct correlation between the initiatives introduced in the summer and the timing of the steady and continuous improvement in likeforlike sales.
As previously communicated this improvement in both sales and customer number momentum has required a moderate level of margin investment.
With the improvement continuing through the festive trading period we were pleased to be cash generative again by the end of the year in line with our expectations.
Group Revenue For the 52 weeks to 29 January 2017 Group revenue increased by 19% from 37.1m to 44.2m.
This growth was supported by contributions from our 11 new stores in the year.
LFL sales were 7.3% for the full year with H1 likeforlike sales being 4.4% and H2 likefor like sales being 10.1%.
These numbers reflect the shape of the key challenging period we experienced during June and October 2016 and as outlined in this review.
Group sales in the first 10 weeks of the new financial year increased by 9% and likeforlike sales were 4.6% for the same period.
Strategic focus We have continued to build on our strategic plan of providing safe good quality fresh meat for the value conscious consumer  which has been reinforced through the customer proposition in the last 6 months.
The customer numbers and feedback confirm that we are back on track and will therefore continue with this journey and approach.
Fresh meat Our managers and butchers continue to be the ambassadors of putting their customers at the heart of our local strategy and this is reinforced with their local level freedom to delight their customers through the fresh meat offer.
Our stores continue to develop local products specific to their community provide local special offers as demonstrated with our successful Christmas Hampers and the planned new BBQ packs for the warmer months ahead.
We are maintaining the number and depth of priceled promotions which also rotate at the managers discretion.
Furthermore we have recently introduced a new store trial of a 4.99 value pack under the umbrella of  once it s gone it s gone concept consisting of great value fresh meat packs with value cutthrough in POS labelling.
The customer s reaction to this treasuretrove concept has been extremely positive.
With our production and distribution capability now set up to service up to c.100 stores we continue to develop our awardwinning quality homemade produce and broaden the range of burgers sausages meatballs kebabs grill sticks and mince in time for the springsummer.
In addition with this new capability in mind we are looking to leverage the spare capacity through expanding our wholesale operations.
T o date we have taken on the supply of a local 3strong chain of local steakhouse restaurants and will consider the opportunities of similar scale relationships.
This allows us to pick up business which better utilises the fixed assets weve already invested in without compromising our ability to serve our stores and customers.
Foodtogo
Within the foodtogo category the same level of local customer focus continues to be applied by our managers and trained cooks.
Our teams have reintroduced a number of store specific favourite dishes to the Butcher s Kitchen menu and continuously test new dishesrecipes with input from their customers.
This provides the perfect platform to showcase the quality of our fresh meat produce presented to the customers freshly cooked and readytogo.
Furthermore we have successfully introduced the principles of our legendary multibuy offers from the fresh meat category to the food totakehome freshly cooked joints category.
This provides customers with a great choice of meal occasion such as cooked whole chickens chicken portions pork loins gammon joints and ham shanks.
These are all cooked fresh daily in store using our inhouse rotisserie and rationale ovens and sold at unit prices mixandmatch multibuys or catchweights depending on customer requirement.
Encouragingly these initiatives have already contributed to an increase in customer numbers and sales.
In addition to these exciting fresh meat and foodtogo opportunities which continue to anchor our value credentials we have stepped up our marketing activity to maintain our current momentum in building customer frequency and loyalty.
Customer driven marketing incentives T o build on the existing customer number momentum we are investing in new ways to achieve customer acquisitions whilst working hard to maintain and lockin existing customer loyalty.
As a wider team we have identified Facebook as the most successful route to get access to a new customer base and the VIP ClubNewsletter route to incentivise customers to keep coming back.
Social media In addition to the Corporate Facebook Page we have now introduced and trialled storespecific Facebook Pages in 11 stores 5 factory shops and 6 high street.
All pages are administered by the local management meaning the content is much more tailored timely and relevant to the customer when compared to a centrally managed approach.
All stores have benefitted from their Facebook launch and customer numbers have increased although it is worth noting the high level of success seen in the factory shops as more and more customers begin to build a visit to the destination factory shop into their routine.
Crawshaw Group Plc Annual Report 52 weeks ended 29 January 201 7 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 05 Crawshaws VIP As part of the Facebook launch we have also introduced the Crawshaws VIP Club into 4 stores 2 factory shops and 2 high street.
This allows our managers to build up awareness on Facebook then incentivise the customers into the store to sign up for the VIP Club to then benefit from a host of exclusive special offers and flash sales.
Newsletter
Once customers are signed up to the VIP Club our managers then have the capability to communicate via email with a regular newsletter containing new products to the range new special offers or even an invitation to take part in new schemes such as recommendafriend .
We are very pleased with the results from the recent marketing initiatives and this acts as a very positive stepchange in customer engagement and participation.
The customer data capture also allows our managers to really target their local offers relevant to their local community.
People
Great quality meat products alone will not succeed in our industry without great people delivering great customer service and experience.
And whilst it has been a challenging year for everyone in the business the speed of our recovery and stability would not have been possible without their input tremendous attitude and commitment.
I continue to be very proud and impressed by their passion to deliver amazing value to our customers every day.
FY 2017 new store performance We opened 11 new stores in the year of which 6 were high street 3 were in shopping centres and 2 were factory shop locations.
From a geographical perspective 7 were in our traditional areas in the North and North West and 4 were in the Midlands with all 11 stores opening on time and on budget.
As would be expected as we have opened more stores there is a wider spread of performance against our base case targets and expectations.
We have a number of stores that have opened well and are trading in line with our expectations equally we have a number of stores which are not trading as strongly as anticipated and encouragingly we have a number of stores which have traded well ahead of expectations from opening day.
Based on the learnings and performance of our new stores we remain very encouraged by the potential and opportunity of our store rollout programme.
FY 2018 growth plan As noted in the Interims of particular interest and significance is the performance of our standalone fresh meat factory shops.
Our 5 fresh meat factory shops sell predominantly fresh meat no hot food togo offer and have higher sales lower operating costs and lower fit out costs than our units on the high street and in shopping centres.
They are also much simpler to operate and manage.
Whilst our location and format strategy has always been one of operating a diverse portfolio across high streets shopping centres and factory shop locations having tested the predictability of the factory shop concept and fully appraised the opportunity we believe it to be very logical and sensible that this should shape the rollout programme for 2017.
Sales recovery programme A flexible commercial framework store managers Rebuilding some of the core decision making processes at store level and empowering store staff to respond to changes in local customer needs.
Increased the number and depth of valueled promotions hero lines for managers to choose the promotions that resonate most with their customers.
Focus on delivering a great butchers customer service.
Continue to rebuild more local supplier relationships.
Fresh meat  sales momentum initiatives Local management input on pricepoint requirements.
Freedom on the range and merchandising to satisfy local customer needs.
Introduction of more weekly store specific valueled promotions.
Local management to balance the bigger packs better value with small packs great value specific to customer needs.
Foodtogo  sales momentum initiatives Flexible principles applied to the Butchers Kitchen foodtogo menu.
Reintroduce the old favourites specific to local customer needs.
Introduction of more valueled promotions e. cooked chickensportions.
Price rollback and flexibility for managers to price menu items locally.
Local supplier flexibility to maximise choice quality and value.
Customer driven marketing incentives We will also maintain a disciplined approach to our growth strategy which means it is imperative that the pace and timings of the store openings are managed correctly.
Accordingly we have signed the lease for our next factory shop which is scheduled to open in May with a sufficient pipeline and capability to open a further 4 factory shops during FY 2018.
Outlook for 2018 The UK grocery market will remain competitive and with industrywide pressures emerging in commodities and labour costs the UK consumer outlook will continue to be more challenging than we have seen in recent years.
Whilst we would ordinarily expect these to have a modest impact on margin in the short term we believe that with our cost management measures and margin additive initiatives together with the expected cost reduction in our business rates we are well placed to navigate through this challenging environment.
Indeed it has been very encouraging to see that we have already proven we are capable and well placed to meet multiple challenges simultaneously whether they are internally or externally driven.
This year has started in line with our expectations as we continue to build on the momentum and improvements from the last 6 months.
The recent journey has also provided everyone with significant experience and learnings that will be extremely important in the months and years ahead.
Our
Furthermore with the performance of our standalone factory shops being a real highlight of the year we are very excited at opening more of this format.

Gross profit margins reduced to 43.5% 2016 45.1% reflecting a less favourable meat pricing environment and an increase in the number and depth of our promotional offers to win back customers.
Both of these impacts moderated through H2 with the margins being achieved in Q4 being ahead of those achieved in Q3.
Presentation of results T o present a clear view of performance of the Group in total and the costs directly driven by the growth strategy we present an Underlying Operating LossProfit number and an Adjusted EBITDA number.
The Underlying Operating LossProfit number adds back share based payment charges and exceptional costs to give a clear view of underlying Group performance.
The Adjusted EBITDA number further excludes depreciation amortisation and accelerated opening costs to give a clear view on the underlying trading performance of the Group Adjusted EBITDA is our primary internal measure when assessing Group performance.
We define accelerated opening costs as the investments in people processes and systems in the year to provide direct support for our accelerated opening programme.
In the year these costs amounted to 1.2m 2016 1.6m and are analysed by component of spend in the table below.

The Loss Before T ax number includes an IFRS 2 shared based payment charge of 0.2m 2016 0.4m.
This translated to a negative EPS as expected at 1.535 pence per share 2016 negative 0.342 pence per share.
Operational overheads Operational overheads are defined as the administrative expenses of the Group less accelerated opening costs exceptional costs impairment depreciation and amortisation and share based payments as this gives a clearer reflection on the underlying operational costs performance of the Group.
On this basis the ratio of overhead costs as a percentage of sales has increased to 41% 2016 38%.
This reflects a dilution from new stores where initial cost ratios are higher as the stores trade through their sales maturity profile and the impact of lower LFL sales.
Cash flow We have closed the year with 2.1m of cash on the balance sheet 2016 4.9m having invested 2.9m of CAPEX in opening 11 new stores.
Maintaining the strength of the balance sheet continues to be a key focus for the Group with the appropriate decisions being taken on pace of rollout and investment in central resource.
Summary
It has been a year of considerable change and challenge as we have navigated through some unexpected external impacts in addition to experiencing some growing pains from significantly scaling up a small entrepreneurial business.
We have now achieved a level of stability in the business which allows us to appraise and plan for the numerous growth opportunities available to the Group.
Alan Richardson Chief Financial Officer 25 April 2017 Crawshaw Group Plc Annual Report 52 weeks ended 29 January 201 7 Our management team have extensive experience in sourcing quality meat products from tried and tested local and international suppliers at the lowest possible prices.
Whilst we do buy longer term to ensure that we have a core range of products we pride ourselves on identifying key lines in the spot market that offer value to our customers.
We have our own distribution centres where we control additional processing and logistics as well as the production of our own award winning sausages beef burgers beef mince and grill sticks.
Our retail outlets are manned with skilled butchers who are happy to help customers with advice on choosing the right product in the right quantities as well as how to cook it.
The Board is focussed on growing the business through identifying new profitable store locations and investing resources in a controlled expansion programme whilst ensuring the core business continues to deliver quality products and excellent customer service at competitive prices.

New products are researched tested and trialled frequently.
Customer feedback is sought and reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Key price points from competitors are monitored regularly.
Our food safety management systems are continually reviewed and updated to ensure our procedures are in line with the highest standards.
As raw meat is a traded commodity the business operates in an environment where input prices can fluctuate based on worldwide natural and economic factors such as a growing world population climate change exchange rates and changing dietary habits.
The Company s purchasing and sales strategy is designed to minimise these risks by ensuring i we sell a broad range of products and in particular as we split into 2 complementary retail areas we cover 2 distinct customer types rather than relying on one product one customer and ii we use a broad range of tried and tested suppliers across the globe rather than relying on any specific supplier or region.
Strategy and Business Model Freshly prepared roast chickens gammon and pork joints hot roast sandwiches shop cooked curries and casseroles chicken and chips as well as other traditional deli products.
Hot and cold cooked food We have a wide range of products sold either i loose in a serve over counter for the traditional experience or ii as multi buy packs on supermarket style multi deck counters which have all been cut and packaged in store.

The Group operates from a head office and distribution centre in Rotherham plus 49 retail locations across Yorkshire Lincolnshire Nottinghamshire Derbyshire the North West and the Midlands.
We protect our customers and our brand by sourcing quality products with full traceability.
Further to this we invest continually to ensure our food safety management systems are implemented delivered and audited at every location.
As the only independent retail butchers chain in England to have Primary Authority we continue to work with the Environmental Health department at Wakefield Council.
This gives each of our locations our staff and our customers a level of consistency in food safety matters as we are all working to the same standards and interpretations of the regulations.
Crawshaws continue to recognise the importance of food safety and positive consistent progress has continued and our Hygiene Ratings.
71% of the business are on 5 stars Very good and 20% on 4 Good.
Our factories have also consistently maintained standards whilst increasing throughput to match the increases in sales.
There continues to be ongoing investment in training which has not only provided legal compliance but has equipped Managers with further knowledge and confidence to maintain food safety.
Customer feedback also indicates consistent quality control and that they are happy that their needs are being met.
The maintenance and continued development of the company Food Safety Management System has been fundamental in maintaining standards across the company.
Whilst the Company will continue to face challenges including changes in legislation we are focused on maintaining food safety on a consistent basis.
The focus on origin and traceability of products will continue to be managed as we recognise this as being essential if we are to meet the requirements of our customers and continue to supply safe and legal products.

Risk Management
The principal risks and uncertainties affecting the Group include the following EU trade deals and exchange rates post BREXIT The Group sources approximately half of the meat volumes sold through the business from the EU.
Any changes to the tariff free trade across current members of the EU will require us to review our sourcing model.
All purchases of goods are made in sterling.
Both short term volatility and long term rebasing of international currency markets will have an impact on raw material prices.
The flexibility to source globally provides a level of mitigation to this risk.
Raw material availability and prices The Group monitors raw material sources on a global basis and either contracts to buy a set volume of goods for a set price for delivering on a specific date or contracts to buy a set volume of goods at a set price over a short time period typically from 2 to 4 weeks.
Key performance indicators The performance of the business is regularly monitored against Key Performance Indicators KPIs.

The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and equity account the Groups interest in associates and joint ventures.
The parent company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its group.
Both the parent company financial statements and the Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRSs.
On publishing the parent company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements the Company is taking advantage of the exemption in s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and related notes that form a part of these approved financial statements.
The current financial period is a 52 week period to 29 January 201 7 .
The prior year was also a 52 week period.
New IFRS and amendments to IAS and interpretations There have been no significant changes to accounting under IFRS which have affected the Groups results.
The Group has considered the following amendments to published standards that are effective for the first time for the 52 weeks ended 29 January 201 7 and concluded that they are either not relevant to the Group or they do not have a significant impact on the Groups financial statements.
These amendments are Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements Amendments to IFRS 1 1 Joint arrangements on accounting for acquisitions of interests in joint operations Amendments to IAS 16 Plant property and equipment and IAS 38 Intangible assets on acceptable methods of depreciation and amortisation Amendments to IAS 27 Consolidation and separate financial statements which allows entities to equity account for joint ventures and associates in their separate financial statements and Annual improvements 201 22014.
There are a number of standards and interpretations issued by the IASB that are effective for financial statements after this reporting period.
These are IFRS 9 Financial Instruments was published in July 2014 and will be effective for the Group from the period beginning 1 February 2018.
The standard is applicable to financial assets and financial liabilities and covers the classification measurement impairment and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities together with a new hedge accounting model.
This standard is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 1 5 Revenue from Contracts with Customers will be effective or the Group from the period beginning 1 February 2018 replacing IAS 18 Revenue IAS 1 1 Construction contracts and related interpretations.
The standard establishes a principles based approach for revenue recognition and is based on the concept of recognising revenue when a customer obtains control of a good or service and has the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the goods or services.
It applies to all contracts with customers except those in the scope of other standards.
It replaces the separate models for goods services and construction contracts under the current accounting standards.
Group believes that the adoption of IFRS 1 5 will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 16 Leases was published in January 2016 and will be effective for the Group from the period beginning 1 February 201 9 replacing IAS 1 7 Leases subject to EU endorsement.
The standard requires lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 1 2 months or less or the underlying asset is of low value.
IFRS 16 represents a significant change in the accounting and reporting of leases and it will primarily change the balance sheet as well as impacting the income statement and lessee reporting as disclosed in note 22.
The Group is in the process of quantifying the impact of the new standard.
The new standard is likely to have an impact on the Groups results and a material impact on the balance sheet as the majority of arrangements that are currently accounted for as operating leases will come onto the Groups balance sheet.
However it is not yet practicable to fully quantify the effect of IFRS 16 on these consolidated financial statements.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
In assessing control the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that are currently exercisable.
The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Change in subsidiary ownership and loss of control Changes in the Groups interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.
Where the Group loses control of a subsidiary the assets and liabilities are derecognised along with any related NCI and other components of equity.
Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.
Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost.
Joint arrangements A joint arrangement is an arrangement over which the Group and one or more third parties have joint control.
These joint arrangement are in turn classified as Joint ventures whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities and Joint operations whereby the Group has rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement.
23 Crawshaw Group Plc Annual Report 52 weeks ended 29 January 201 7 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Accounting policies continued
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence but not control over the financial and operating policies.
Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20 and 50% of the voting power of another entity.
Application of the equity method to associates and joint ventures Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method equity accounted investees and are initially recognised at cost.
The Groups investment includes goodwill identified on acquisition net of any accumulated impairment losses.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the total comprehensive income and equity movements of equity accounted investees from the date that significant influence or joint control commences until the date that significant influence or joint control ceases.
When the Groups share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee the Groups carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an investee.
Joint operations Where the Group is a party to a joint operation the consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the joint operations assets and liabilities as well as the Groups share of the entitys profit or loss and other comprehensive income on a linebyline basis.
The accounting policies set out below have unless otherwise stated been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
Going concern The Groups business activities together with the factors likely to affect its future development performance and position are set out in the Strategy and Business Model on page 08.
In addition notes 1 9 and 20 set out the Groups objectives policies and processes for managing its capital and exposures to credit and liquidity risk.
As highlighted in note 20 the Group meets its day to day working capital requirements through cash generated from operations and borrowings.
Current cash headroom totals 2.
1 m.
In the year the Group entered into a 4m 5 year Revolving Credit Facility with RBS.
The facility was undrawn at year end and is expected to remain undrawn through FY 2018.
The Groups forecasts and cash projections taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance as a result of the uncertain economic conditions show that the Group should be able to operate within its cash reserves with the appropriate decisions being taken on the pace of new store rollout to ensure a sufficient working capital buffer is maintained to cover day to day cash requirements of the business.
Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group In applying policies consistent with IAS 32 financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions a they include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group and b where the instrument will or may be settled in the Groups own equity instruments it is either a nonderivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Groups own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Groups exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability.
Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Groups own shares the amounts presented in this financial information for called up share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
Preference share capital is classified as equity if it is nonredeemable or redeemable only at the Companys option and any dividends are discretionary.
Dividends thereon are recognised as distributions within equity upon approval by the Groups shareholders.
Preference share capital is classified as a liability if it is redeemable on a specific date or at the option of the shareholders or if dividend payments are not discretionary.
Dividends thereon are recognised as interest expense in profit or loss as accrued.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance expenses.
Finance payments associated with financial instruments that are classified in equity are treated as distributions and are recorded directly in equity.

The estimated useful lives are as follows Freehold property 5% 10% Leasehold buildings in accordance with the lease term Leasehold improvements in accordance with the lease term Plant equipment and vehicles 3 1 5 years straight line basis Intangible assets and goodwill Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition of businesses.
In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since 1 1 December 2006 goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.
Identifiable intangibles are those which can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights regardless of whether those rights are separable.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cashgenerating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
Any impairment is then recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
Intangible assets that are acquired by the Group which have finite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
IFRS 1 grants certain exemptions from the full requirements of Adopted IFRSs in the transition period.
The Company elected not to restate business combinations in Crawshaw Butchers Limited that took place prior to 1 February 2006.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 February 2006 goodwill is included at 1 February 2006 on the basis of its deemed cost which represents the amount recorded under UK GAAP which was broadly comparable save that only separable intangibles were recognised and goodwill was amortised.
Amortisation
Amortisation is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets other than goodwill from the date that they are available for use.
The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows Brand 20 years
The carrying amounts of the Groups assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
For goodwill and intangible assets that are not yet available for use the recoverable amount is estimated at each balance sheet date.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cashgenerating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cashgenerating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cashgenerating units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis.
A cash generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
Calculation of recoverable amount The recoverable amount of other assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows the recoverable amount is determined for the cashgenerating unit to which the asset belongs.
Reversals of impairment An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets an impairment loss is reversed when there is an indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist and there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined net of depreciation or amortisation if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material provisions are determined by discounting the expected risk adjusted future cash flows at a pretax riskfree rate.
Trade and other receivables T rade and other receivables are recognised at their fair value and thereafter at amortised cost less impairment charges.

A provision is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under shortterm cash bonus or profitsharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Revenue

T ax is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for the initial recognition of goodwill the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.

Segmental reporting An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Groups other components.
Operating segments operating results are reviewed regularly by the Chief Executive Officer to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance and for which discrete financial information is available.
The Directors consider each location to be a separate operating segment.
The Directors have applied the provisions within IFRS 8 for aggregation of operating segments with similar risks and markets to have one reportable segment.
The Groups business operations are conducted exclusively in the UK so geographical segment reporting is not required.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty The preparation of the financial information in conformity with IFRS required management to make judgements estimated and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities income and expense.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
The estimates associated with the assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision only affects that period or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually.
Acquired brand values were calculated using the royalty relief approach and are amortised over 20 years.
The remaining amortisation period is 10 years and 2 months.
The amortisation and impairment charge is recognised in the following line items in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 2017 2016 Administrative expenses Impairment testing Goodwill arose on the Groups original acquisition of Crawshaw Butchers Limited and on the subsequent acquisitions of East Yorkshire Beef Limited in June 2014 and Gabbotts Farm Limited in April 201 5.
Each store is treated as a separate cash generating unit grouped together into relevant group of CGUs for the purposes of impairment testing.
The goodwill supported by the expected future cash flows of each relevant group of CGUs as at 31 January 201 7 is as follows 2017 2016 Crawshaw Butchers Limited 7029 7029 East Yorkshire Beef Limited Gabbotts Farm Limited 3384 3384 The recoverable amount of Crawshaw Butchers Ltd East Yorkshire Beef Limited and Gabbotts Farm Limited acquisition has been calculated with reference to their value in use.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and projections approved by management for the next 5 years and assuming an estimated long term annual growth rate of 2.0% for the subsequent 25 years 201 5 2.0%.
The financial budgets and projections are based on past experience and actual operating results.
The growth rates for the 5 year period are based on current performance of the existing store and product mix.
The Directors believe that the longterm growth rate does not exceed the average longterm growth rate for the UK economy the principal geographic area in which Crawshaws operates.
The Directors estimate the discount rates using the posttax rates that reflect the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cashgenerating unit.
In the current year the Directors estimate the applicable pretax rate to be 8.8% 2016 1 3.3%.
The Directors modelled a range of different scenarios by applying sensitivities to both the cash flow assumptions and the discount rate.
Based on the sensitivity analysis there is sufficient headroom between the value in use calculation and the carrying value of the CGU.
