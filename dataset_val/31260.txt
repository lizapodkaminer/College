Improvement in Operational
Generated 292m in revenue which puts the Group approximately 16% ahead of 2016 thanks to an exceptional performance from our people during the year.
The adoption of IFRS15 in next years annual report is expected to result in restated revenue of circa 300m and profit and total comprehensive income of around 7.2m for 2017 primarily due to restricted recognition of variable income on legacy contracts in earlier years.
Further details of the expected transition can be found in note 1.
Our cash balance as at 31 December 2017 stood at 17.01 million an increase of 5.60 million from 2016.
Current order book for construction in 2018 stands at approximately 299m which is just over 90% of the revenue expectations for the current year.
Underlying profit is profit before tax excluding legacy contract losses of 7.29m 2016 3.85m.
Legacy contracts are construction contracts entered into at the height of the recession before 31 December 2013 and which carried a high commercial and contractual risk.
These contracts have negatively impacted the Groups income statement in 2013 and subsequent years.
Net cash is cash at the bank at year end less any obligations under finance leases.

Cash continued to be generated from operations during the year with the cash position at the year end significantly improving to 17.01 million 2016 11.41 million.
Dividend
The Board is proposing a maintained dividend of 3.0p per share thus increasing the full year dividend to 6.0p 2016 4.5p.
Corporate Governance The Board remains very aware of the risks that the business faces as it continues to grow in a highly competitive environment and undertakes contracts of a higher notational value.
Risk management capabilities continue to be strengthened and stringent review of potential opportunities is The Group has promising opportunities for growth in all its chosen markets and as the key customer relationships continue to mature projects of a higher value are becoming available.
Underlying profit 40.44% 2016 5.91m
16.48% 2016 250.49m Recent Performance The Group has increased its underlying profit for the year which is a very encouraging result.
However it is disappointing to report that the strong growth in both revenue and profitability has been significantly impacted upon by the ongoing legacy contractual dispute with Cyden Homes Limited and the poor second half trading performance of the Utilities division.
Group revenue increased by 16.48% to 291.77 million 2016 250.49 million with operating profit decreasing by 46.88% to 1.19 million 2016 2.24 million.
Excluding the deleterious effect of the legacy contract normal trading profitability improved by 40.44% to 8.30 million 2016 5.91 million.

Robust and effective governance is more essential than ever.
Procedures and controls continue to be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure the protection of shareholder interests.
Our People Our people are the cornerstone of the Group particularly in an organisation that still undertakes a significant proportion of its workload utilising its own resources.
In an increasingly competitive market the attraction development and retention of the calibre of resource with the appropriate skills required to satisfy the growth potential of the Group is of paramount importance.
We are intent on maintaining the development of a sustainable ethical business that cares for its individuals the environment and the communities where it both impacts on and draws its resources from.
Investment in leadership skillbased and professional qualification attainment training has been maintained to allow each individual to contribute to their full potential.
Testament to this is the number of training days completed increasing by 23.7% over the previous year.
To achieve our strategic targets the creation of a more diverse workforce is essential and in the construction industry in general gender disparity still continues.
This is the first year that a Gender Pay Gap report has been published and it reflects the lower proportion of women in senior roles within the Group.
This coupled with only an 11% total female representation within the Group is outdated.
A more progressive and embracing approach is now being adopted to secure the injection of female talent that is required to take the Group forward and provide a different perspective to the business.
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all the employees for their hard work and commitment during this last year as the business is entirely dependent upon their contribution.
Health and Safety The wellbeing of all the Groups employees is of paramount concern to your Board.
The cycle of improved performance has been maintained with the Accident Frequency Rate AFR reducing to a highly creditable 0.04 2016 0.11.
The culture is now well embedded with the emphasis moving from Safe to
Opportunity for Growth The Group has promising opportunities for growth in all its chosen markets and as the key customer relationships continue to mature projects of a higher value are becoming available.
The AMP7 retendering cycle by certain water companies equally offers a further opportunity for future expansion within the water industry.
The Group is currently engaged in several joint ventures which currently are all delivering positively.
The
Elan Valley Aqueduct in particular already being the recipient of several awards.
Outlook
The secured order book for completion in the current year is 299 million 2017 225 million and the Group is forecasting further sustainable growth this current year based upon this and further opportunities in the pipeline.

Review
UK Economic Conditions Economic growth will continue to rise in four of our five key market sectors primarily due to ongoing investment in UK National Infrastructure sustained increase in the demand and provision of university places and the growing need for increased social and private housing.
The only sector where there is a significant downturn over the next three years is fibre broadband installation as a result of the near completion of the roll out programme which will impact on our Telecommunications segment.
The unemployment rate is at a record low which in conjunction with the skills gap and growth in our market sectors will set us challenges with regard to recruiting and retaining the right people.
Brexit has caused uncertainty around the UK economy in general and this has the potential to distort some of our markets including price pressures in our supply chain due to the weakening of the pound.
What this means for NM Group We expect significant profitable growth during the next three years in line with our indepth Strategic Business Plan projections.
This will not only be as a result of increased investment but the specific areas of investment where we already provide a specialist service.
Our Plan details how we will maximise these niche opportunities to significantly improve our return on investment.
Construction Market The National Infrastructure and Construction Pipeline Analysis 2016 identifies committed government investment in the Affordable Homes Programme rising to circa 2.2 billion in the period 20182019 with sustained investment of circa 2 billion from 2019 to 2021.
Whilst the Housing Infrastructure Fund programme has had a slow start in 20172018 it is forecast to rise to circa 800 million and circa 1.2 billion in 20192020 and 20202021 respectively.
Universities continue to have access to significant funds to develop their sites primarily to attract more students.
As such investment in student accommodation looks set to continue to support this potential growth.
According to the DfE National pupil projections July 2016 we have experienced a demographic dip in student numbers during the last five years.
However as a result of successive baby booms from the start of the new millennium this downward trend has changed with a defined increase in 18year olds of 8% by 2020 compared to 2017 and a further 10% increase by 2025 compared to 2020.
This equates to circa 160000 more university places being required by 2025 based on record numbers of 18year olds going to university in 2017.

Full capital investment runs at circa 3 billion up to 201819 but then worryingly the investment profile halves over the period 201819 to 201920 and then rapidly declines to circa 250 million by 202021.
Annual investment in the electricity transmission and distribution network is set to fall to circa 1 billion by 202021 from levels of circa 1.2 billion in 201819.
Thereafter however it will increase to just over 1.1 billion for followon years.
Waste to Energy and Biomass annual investment currently runs at circa 1 billion however all identified projects will be complete by the end of 2019.
What this means for NM Group Investment downturn in wind energy Investment increase in transmission and distribution focusing on upgrade and refurbishment Downturn in waste to energy plant investments over next three years Highways Market Highways England have announced the replacement of their Collaborative Delivery Framework worth 4 billion over four years with an option for an additional four years January 2019 to December 2027.
They are looking to appoint 12 partners over six areas this equates to 1 billion per annum and 60 million to 80 million per contractor.
The National Infrastructure and Construction Pipeline Analysis 2016 identifies committed government investment in highways infrastructure of circa 1.2 billion in 20182019 rising to circa 1.4 billion in 20192020.
This spend excludes motorway improvement programmes SMART motorway investment and individual major A road projects.
This will be updated in 2019 to reflect new investment plans for the period 20202024.

Spend in 20192020 is then due to marginally decline to circa 3.4 billion before significantly reducing in 20202021 to circa 1.1 billion.
Thereafter the only identified communications investment programme is the 700MHz Clearance but this is a small programme at an annual spend of circa 50 million by 20212022.
In view of this rapid decline by 2020 we need to consider our options such as developing alternative market streams during 201819 which utilise the skills of our Utilities division.
Water Market The sector is forecast to continue at current investment levels of circa 4 billion per annum.
Of this there is a commitment to spend circa 2 billion per annum on upgrades and new works including circa 40% through offsite build solutions 1.2 billion per annum on capital maintenance and 500 million per annum on infrastructure schemes.
The fundamental change over the next 10 years will be the specific work stream investments with a move to more asset optimisation maintenance refurbishment and sludge to energy to meet TotEx and Outcome based drivers.
New technologies for pipeline sealing and replacement will potentially negate intrusive RandM.
Increases in housing 250000 homes per annum will fuel existing plant optimisation and demand innovative ways to increase productivity from existing assets.

North Midland Construction PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT 25748 5 April 2018 1124 AM Proof 14 Chief Executives
John Homer  Chief Executive Overview of the year It is disappointing that the focus on a healthy underlying Group performance from continuing operations appears to continue to be diverted by the outcome of the remaining legacy contract.
The overall focus of our strategic plan is built around continuing with the six strategic priorities identified with an increased focus on our people our quality first approach and further investment in technology.
Cash
Our continued focus on driving a cash culture throughout the business has made good progress in the year.
The emphasis on cash being the responsibility of the operational divisions with reports and measures being provided by the finance function is starting to have the desired effect.
The cash balance at the end of the year of 17.01 million is testament to the progress that has been made.
Our focus on the type of work to be undertaken will be to continue to build on the core strengths and capabilities of the
It is intended to continue to play to our strengths in the Water sector while looking for growth in other areas to reduce our reliance on this market and mitigate the cyclical effects of the AMP procurement cycle.
Utilities losses At the interim update we announced that the division achieved a break even position for the first six months trading.
Since that date we have experienced serious difficulties on the work stream undertaken for Virgin Media on the term contract for telecoms work.
Our activities have become embroiled in the difficulties that this customer has been experiencing and this has led to fragmented and inefficient working patterns.
The division is heavily engaged in dialogue with this customer to achieve a satisfactory resolution to this problem.
Operations
It is pleasing to be able to report good progress is being seen on improving the operational performance of the remainder of the Group.
Our short term target of achieving 3% net return on sales is firmly within our sights.
Our vision of 5% margins in the future is achievable by continuing to enhance our offering upstream into design project investment and by delivering more efficiently.
The employment of our direct labour force and operation of our own plant fleet will assist our drive for margin growth.
The use of off site build techniques will combat skill shortages and ensure that quality of workmanship is achieved.
Order book The markets in which we operate remain buoyant and the need for investment into the infrastructure of the nation continues to grow.
We continue to exercise critical judgement over the orders we take into the business and ensure that effective governance is in place at all stages of securing work.
Our order book for construction in 2018 stands at 299 million 2016 225 million.
Safety
It is pleasing to see that our Health and Safety performance has improved significantly during this year.
From a 2016 AFR of 0.11 which represented five RIDDORs we are currently running at 0.04 which represents two RIDDORs for 2017.
Our
It is however clearly apparent 16 North Midland Construction PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 25748 5 April 2018 1124 AM Proof 14 that a focus on this at all times is a must and a slight slip in concentration can lead to a hazard causing an accident.
People and culture People remain the key to our success and we intend to build on our achievements in this area.
Our offering of leadership and management programmes has been refreshed and is now accredited under the new Apprenticeship Levy.
Two programmes have commenced and feedback is positive.
Our
We have started reevaluation of our entire Employee Experience agenda and workshops have been held at the Leadership Briefing sessions so that everyone has the chance to contribute to the future culture of the Group.
This has been well received.
It is an undisputed fact that our people and our culture are the single largest competitive advantage that we have.
We have committed wholeheartedly to the Apprenticeship programme through our own inhouse academy.
We currently have 7% of our workforce engaged on this programme.
Technology
During this year we have continued to invest in our digital future and progressing our BIM agenda.
A decision was taken in the middle of the year to defer the application for British Standard certification until this was embedded in the business.
The certification will be applied for in early 2018.
A commitment to Viewpoint 4 Projects as our Common Data Environment CDE has been made and we are rolling this out across the business.
A lot more work needs to be done on this to realise the full efficiency potential that exists.
Supply chain Investment continues to be made into the creation and development of the supply chain required to support our growth.
Supplier relationships are reviewed regularly on a 360 degree basis.
A number of interactive workshop sessions have been held throughout the year.
It is pleasing to see our creditor days recorded at 43 which is an incremental improvement on 52 in 2016 and 60 in 2015.
It is intended that we continue to seek to improve our performance in this area.
Skills shortage We continue to focus on both our positive employee brand and alternative methods in order to combat the skills shortage.
It is clear that our ability to attract and retain the right quality and quantity of people to undertake work is a driver for us.
Our efforts on the training and development front are showing good results.
We are particularly pleased with our approach to the new government Apprenticeship Levy and intend to build further on this success
The business is well positioned for growth going forward.

Cash
Progress in 2017 Actions we instigated as part of our 2017 business plan included a daily cash report weekly finance dashboard and monthly trading assessments of unrealised cash.
This has resulted in a significant overall improvement in the cash balance to 17.01 million 2016 11.41 million and reduced unrealised cash.
The Group has slightly reduced the average credit period taken by its customers to 32 days 2016 33 days.
The average credit period taken on credit purchases has also reduced to 43 days 2016 52 days due to shorter terms being offered to maintain the best supply chain and achieve the most commercial pricing.
Priorities for 2018 We will continue to embed a cash culture to manage our cash more effectively the focus being right down to project level from contract selection and approval through the entire contract process and up to the final account payment.
This includes improved operational reporting and flow of information to project teams and divisional management.
Driving cash allows us to ensure it flows to our supply chain who are critical for our growth plans and pivotal in our future success.
Our priorities for 2018 include the continuing execution of robust internal processes coupled with the ongoing measurement of cash collection days and utilising the cash we generate in higher margin activities or to achieve the most effective commercial position from our supply chain.
Our Measures Cash collection days WIPDebt days combined Cash collection against forecast Overdue balances Overdue retentions Our Associated Risks Credit risk liquidity risk interest rate risk Integrity of financial controls Contracting strategy and execution Weekly cash dashboard During 2017 we formalised a weekly cash dashboard which is circulated every Monday morning to all of the divisional directors senior teams and commercial teams.
The dashboard gives real time information assessing the outstanding cash in relation to Undercertified applications outstanding Invoiced debt overdue Retentions overdue Forecast cash collection against actual rolling 4 week period This information allows the management of cash at a project level ensuring that as the Group grows control of cash collection is rigorously maintained.

Profit
Progress in 2017 The success of this strategic objective has unfortunately been undermined by another one of our strategic objectives due to significant losses on the one remaining legacy contract.
Focusing on the underlying performance of the Group as defined the Group has reported underlying profits of 8.30 million 2016 5.91 million which is a net return on sales of 2.84% 2016 2.36%.
This is testament to the move into higher margin markets products and services which will continue into 2018 and beyond.
Priorities for 2018 As stated above the Group is focused on continuing to organically progress in higher margin markets products and services namely offsite manufacture design services bespoke major projects and small development opportunities.
This will continue at a divisional level throughout the period.
As part of the 2018 business plan the Board identified areas where the continuing business would be able to increase its margins and this is also where significant focus will be given.
Quality first initiative  The purpose is to raise awareness challenge the norms and drive improvements and workplace satisfaction leading to benefits for all involved Increased margin Supports a sustainable business Removes environmental waste Quality product for our clients right first time with less disruption and time delays Efficiency for the Group and our supply chain Continued development of our culture in satisfaction of delivering a successful project Our Measures Margin by contract Risks and opportunities identified and monitored by project Cost of nonconformance reporting Procurement savings Programme management Our Associated Risks Contracting strategy and execution Inappropriate contract terms Failure to comply could lead to reputational damage warranty claims or financial penalties Integrity of financial controls NM Investments During 2017 the Group reviewed the best use of the cash it generated and the current opportunities across its market segments.
One of the key successes in this area was partnering with developers in the residential property market through Joint venture on a small residential development Construction financing Both business models ensured the Group was fully securitised.
The projects were only on a very small scale in relation to the Groups turnover but allowed significant additional margin to be achieved.

Losses
Progress in 2017 Although on the face of the financial results it would seem that the Group has gone backwards in relation to this strategic priority it is only the one remaining legacy contract that has significantly affected financial performance in 2017.
The changes the Group has made have ensured that during 2017 there has not been any contract added to the Groups commercial risk register which is testament to the following changes that have been embedded in the Groups procedures through 2017 Thorough contract selection Robust corporate governance Rigorous risk management Active contract performance monitoring Immediate corrective action Contract risk level review Project monitoring assessments We believe that discussing and understanding the potential risks at an earlier stage and engaging with the right skilled people means that we are able to better plan and mitigate accordingly.
Priorities for 2018 We will continue to review our processes across the business to continuously drive effective commercial and operational delivery of projects extending the work already completed in 2017.
A key focus for 2018 and beyond is understanding the potential level of change in projects.
Change means additional cost for our client our supply chain and the Group and we believe reducing the potential for change at the onset of a project will benefit all stakeholders.
The management of significant change on projects is also an area of strategic focus for 2018.
Our Measures Contract risk level review Change management assessment and reporting Project monitoring assessments Margin by contract Risks and opportunities identified and monitored Our Associated Risks Contracting strategy and execution Integrity of financial controls Contractual disputes Damage to reputation Financial loss Lack of integrity of financial information used to manage the business Tender review board TRB The TRB process is the Groups internal prepricing risk assessment of potential projects.
The prepricing procedures ensure that assessments and understanding of risk are completed at an earlier stage in the process and our governance strengthened to involve divisional and Board Directors as required.
The processes have been developed to drive a culture of transparency and team involvement.
The system is fully automated and in 2017 has ensured no potential loss making contract has been added to the commercial risk register.

Creating Safety is our approach to challenging the beliefs and behaviours of everyone in the Group.
We have identified and evaluated ourselves on 18 areas relating to our positive Health and Safety culture which has provided us with focus action areas including workplace environment data measurement and defining accountability.
Having identified these actions we are implementing operationally led improvement plans across the Group.
To support this approach we are introducing inductions to our safety culture these interactive scenariobased sessions will be holistic in nature giving a view on what our safety culture feels and looks like coupled with engagement pride and personal responsibility.

Communication
Progress in 2017 As part of our Business Leadership programme a team of senior leaders assessed our communication strategy in line with our brand and input from internal and external stakeholder groups.
This brought both encouraging findings from our internal people satisfaction survey and recommendations to enhance our future strategy for communication.
These recommendations and research drove significant change during the year and has shaped how we will successfully implement our plans during 2018.
Our progress has included A focused approach and activity plan to utilise multiple channels for improving our internal communications Recruitment of a Group Communications Manager Enhancing our Leadership Briefings based on the feedback from our people Regional Corporate Inductions Regional People Consultation Committee and Representatives of Employee Safety ROES meetings Our case study below highlights more about our regional Leadership Briefings and the DREAMS employee workshops held in 2017.

Construction
Building Division With our key senior staff now in place we have set out our growth plans and have a real opportunity to progress our business through 2018 and beyond.
Overall segment performance Our Building division has grown rapidly over the past three years and is anticipated to be a 40m plus turnover business.
With our key senior staff now in place we have clearly set out our growth plans and have a real opportunity to progress our business through 2018 and beyond.
Trading in 2017 has seen us reach our profit target with turnover exceeding budget.
We currently have a number of projects on site Denby Street Sheffield  a 24m student accommodation development with the second site at 8.5m for Host Student Operators and at Grove Park Leicester a 1.7m new office project for Stephen George and Partners
This is another scheme for us on this business complex.
We also completed the 4m Selly Oak student accommodation project in Birmingham during 2017.
These schemes coupled with exciting enquiries means that we are set to have a successful 2018.
We have plenty of opportunities available to us as the market is relatively settled and should be able to support our planned growth.
Both the student accommodation sector and residential markets are still strong with regular opportunities being received.
Equally enquiries from the health sector are still encouraging and university funding for site development is still at a high enabling us to target schemes in both areas.
Outlook for 2018 Our intention is to strengthen our brand within the construction marketplace to ensure our offering is visible to all our customers to encourage new opportunities and repeat business.
We continue to foster relationships with developers operating locally including a series of opportunities with our joint venture partner Earl and Pelham Limited across the region.
The first scheme of this nature Enderleigh Mews in Nottingham is a development of 10 fourbedroom houses in the picturesque grounds of the house formerly known as Enderleigh.
The partnership will bring high quality bespoke developments to Nottingham and the wider area.
Key targets for 2018 include Enhancement of customer experience and support Develop supply chain relationships and management Continue with our positive staff culture supporting all our team in their development 28 North Midland Construction PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 Pictured Artists impression of Enderleigh project Pictured West Burton Power Station Pictured Elevation of Denby Street Sheffield Pictured West Burton Power Station 5 April 2018 1124 AM Proof 14

Highways
Highways Division Growth for the division has been very encouraging over the course of the year with key successes on frameworks coupled with wins of public realm and highway contracts.
Overall segment performance The trading performance of our Highways division has seen budgeted targets exceeded.
Work volumes were ahead of the forecast for the year at 45m and delivery margins were also ahead of budget projections at 639k.
The division operates in three regions East West and South.
Whilst planned activity in the East and West regions remains high there is a current imbalance of work in the Southern region.
Growth for the division has been very encouraging over the course of the year with key successes on frameworks coupled with wins of public realm and highway contracts.
The YORcivil2 construction framework win was a key success covering civil engineering works for North and South Yorkshire including major flood defence projects and highway and bridge works.
It combines East Riding of Yorkshire Council located in the North and East of the region with Leeds City Council and Sheffield City Council in the South and West and includes projects ranging up to a value of 10m.
Another significant success is the Manchester City Council four year supplier framework for highways and infrastructure projects.
The entire framework is expected to deliver works to a value of 240m across the Greater Manchester region including highways development bridge construction and other civils works.
This framework can also be used by other Association of Greater Manchester Authorities AGMA and having secured a place on all eight lots will see us work across the region through to 2022.
We have also successfully gained access to the following regional highways frameworks Bristol City Councils Highways and Associated Works Framework Lincolnshire County Council and Nottingham and Derby Frameworks for Highway
From a public realm perspective we have successfully delivered prestigious public realm schemes in Bristol StokeonTrent and Lincoln to improve roads and pavements in the cities retail and commercial centres.
We have also completed a number of large infrastructure projects for IKEA providing vital access to their new store in Sheffield and a 17m infrastructure project for York Potash in Whitby.
Outlook for 2018 Following the success of our key wins during 2017 we are looking forward to maximising our opportunities under these frameworks over the course of the coming year and have identified further areas of development in highway maintenance and geographical expansion.

Overall segment performance This year has been focused on improving operational performance of the division.
Network expansion projects are performing well with the necessary levels of control and governance in place to ensure targets are monitored and achieved.
Our framework contracts do have their challenges in terms of work volumes and process consistency however we are working to improve this performance across the division to increase customer service.
Due to the high volume of orders from existing telecoms customers this work has been our focus.
It remains a priority for the management team to diversify by developing our design and build capability.
At the interim update we announced that the division achieved a break even position for the first six months trading.
Since that date we have experienced serious difficulties on the work stream undertaken for Virgin Media on the term contract for telecoms work.
Our activities have become embroiled in the difficulties that this customer has been experiencing and this has led to fragmented and inefficient working patterns.
The division is heavily engaged with dialogue with this customer to achieve a satisfactory resolution of this problem.
Our health and safety record and culture has significantly improved through an increase in and higher quality of reporting enabling us to make changes to keep our people safe.
We have also been working hard on our customer experience implementing new processes and procedures following external reviews.
This has seen us restore our position as a partner of choice for Virgin Media which has in turn provided the opportunity for additional works particularly in the Midlands region.
Outlook for 2018 In order to drive further business improvement during the course of 2018 we have identified the following key areas we regard as critical to success People  Ensuring the morale of our teams remains high Quality  Continue with implementing processes with continual review Programme  Balancing our standalone projects and our framework commitments Customer  Focus on our customer relationships and commercial performance 31 North Midland Construction PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT Pictured Construction begins at Frankley Pictured Our Newark delivery team at the launch of the Siege Breaker tunnel boring machine 5 April 2018 1124 AM Proof 14

Overall segment performance The NMCNomenca division has had another strong year being cash positive and turnover standing at 114m with notable progress on flagship schemes and significant wins.
We were successful in securing a new joint venture infrastructure contract for Severn Trent Water on the Birmingham Resilience Project.
The design and construction of a new water treatment plant at Frankley is worth in excess of 100m over the duration of the contract and is being built out with our partner Doosan Enpure Limited.
The scheme commenced on site in the third quarter of 2017 and will be delivered over the next three years.
The Elan Valley Aqueduct scheme another key project for Severn Trent in the AMP6 programme of works celebrated 365 days accident free and completed the first tunnelling phase of the project.
This has culminated in being awarded the New Civil Engineer Tunnelling Award in the category of Specialist Tunnelling Project of the Year.
It was a blend of the complex nature of the construction of three tunnels along with sustainability community engagement and logistics that won the accolade.
Tunnelling also commenced on the Newark improvement scheme Severn Trents largest investment in the East Midlands to protect their customers from flooding.
The new 4.5km of pipeline has a diameter of 3.2 metres and is the backbone of the scheme which runs underneath the town.
Outlook for 2018 To further build on the NMCNomenca foundation and operational model the amalgamation of the Civil Engineering business into NMCNomenca will allow the continued delivery of nonregulatory projects.

Overview of 2017 This year has been a period of continuing to strengthen the business in preparation for a sustainable growth in quality of earnings and respectable dividend yields.
Further significant investment has been made in implementing governance controls to manage risk and into the development of our people to meet the increasing demands of our customers for a highquality service.
The Group is now well positioned to take advantage of the increase in infrastructure spending plans that prevail.
The net return is disappointing and has been significantly impacted by the remaining legacy contract.
The underlying profitability cash generation and secured workload for 2018 are the significant positives which give the Board confidence for the Groups future.
Underlying profit 40.44% 2016 5.91m Operating profit 46.88% 2016 2.24m 34 North Midland Construction PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 25748 5 April 2018 1124 AM Proof 14 The underlying profitability in the year of 8.30 million is a significant increase on the previous year.
Overall coordination of our activities is carried out through the Executive Leadership Team ELT which is chaired by the Chief Executive.
Membership consists of the Finance Director Directors of the divisions and the central services functions.
The overarching purpose of this body is to ensure consistency of best practice and to drive performance improvement across all of our activities.
Group financial performance The growth in turnover of 16.48% to 291.77 million 2016 250.49 million is encouraging and is borne from our vision of growing revenues in our chosen markets with our repeat and framework clients.
It is also very encouraging to see the level of new customers and enquiries in 2017 achieved through the quality of customer experience that the Group delivers.
Although not at the level the Board finds acceptable an operating profit of 1.19 million 2016 2.24 million has been achieved in the year.
The underlying profitability in the year of 8.30 million 2016 5.91 million is a significant increase on the previous year and shows the exceptional performance in the main of the continuing business segments.
The impact of the legacy contract has once again reduced the net margin return as highlighted in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income and on page 91.
The current tax debit of 0.26 million 2016 0.57 million credit arises due to current tax on profits at 19.25% in addition to a reduction in the deferred tax rate applicable to taxable temporary differences.
Total comprehensive income for the year has reduced to 0.74 million 2016 2.63 million and in turn earnings per share has reduced to 7.31p 2016 25.95p.
The Board is proposing to retain the final dividend at 3.0p taking the total dividend for the year to 6.0p 2016 4.5p.
The total dividend is only covered 1.22 times 2016 5.80 times and has been proposed as an exceptional dividend as per the Groups dividend policy and is due to the underlying performance of the Group the cash generation and the secured workload for 2018.
The Board anticipates an improving performance for 2018 and beyond.
Legacy contracts are construction contracts entered into at the height of the recession before 31 December 2013 and which carried a high contractual and commercial risk.
These contracts have negatively impacted the Groups income statement in 2013 and subsequent years.
As at 31 December 2017 there is only one legacy contract remaining.
In the year to 31 December 2017 the total loss before tax recognised on legacy contracts was 7.29 million 2016 3.85 million.
During the year to 31 December 2016 the Group completed all onsite works for the one remaining legacy contract thereby removing any further uncertainty around costs to fulfil the contract.
Contract revenue on the one remaining legacy contract has been recognised based on the prudent best estimate of the Directors as at 31 December 2017 of the amount recoverable from the client with an amount outstanding included within trade receivables.
Following a High Court ruling towards the end of 2017 which did not support the application of the well established prevention principle in relation to this contract the Company has been granted leave to appeal this decision by the Court of Appeal.
On the advice of the Companys lawyers the Directors will vigorously pursue this appeal but have decided to make a further provision against the outstanding debt.
This matter will be kept under constant review and further announcements will be made if appropriate.
The Group is and will be pursuing claims with the client for sums greater than the carrying value.
The Directors have sought to make the estimate as precise as possible by reflecting the views of independent quantum and legal experts who were appointed by the Directors for their ability qualifications and experience in this field.
The independent quantum and legal experts in conjunction with management considered a number of factors when making their assessment such as contractual terms work performed claims for variations submissions for extensions of time claims for loss and expense and expected time frames in which settlement is likely.
Whilst the Directors are making every effort to seek a swift resolution to the matter they are committed to achieving the best possible result for the Group.
The ultimate settlement of this matter may take in excess of 12 months to achieve.
Further details of the legacy contract can be found on page 100.
Group financial position It is very pleasing to report that our key strategic focus around driving cash is evident in the increase in the year end cash balance of 17.01 million 2016 11.41 million.
The Group has integrated further visibility for the divisions highlighting the importance of cash and improved discipline around cash collection and upfront agreement of contractual terms.

Review
This has meant that despite the 16.48% increase in revenue the Group has reduced the average credit period taken by its customers to 32 days 2016 33 days leading to a slight outflow of cash across construction contracts and trade and other receivables of 0.64 million 2016 0.94 million.
The average credit period taken on credit purchases has also reduced to 43 days 2016 52 days due to shorter terms being offered to maintain the best supply chain and achieve the most commercial pricing.
The inflow of cash of 7.58 million 2016 4.56 million due to the increase in trade and other payables to 68.72 million 2016 61.15 million is also due to the increase in revenue and increase in cash collection in the fourth quarter giving a higher other taxes and social security costs creditor of 6.73 million 2016 4.67 million.
The Group ensures it has a sustainable working capital mix to support our growth across all contracts and segments and has secured increased banking facilities in early 2018 to allow us to do this.
We are also targeting reducing creditor payment terms further to allow our supply chain to grow with us.
It is also pleasing to report that the net cash has increased to 12.04 million 2016 7.43 million which is due to the increase in cash above and despite an increase in finance lease borrowings.
As a result of the Groups growth the net investment during the year on property plant and equipment increased to 2.90 million 2016 1.30 million in line with the Companys strategy to purchase equipment where possible rather than expense through operating leases.
Following this investment in capital assets the closing net book value of non current assets stood at 17.12 million 2016 13.65 million which positions the Group to deliver its targeted growth through 2018 and beyond.
Outlook
The UK construction industry is struggling to keep up with the demand to maintain the existing infrastructure and the need for investment to support future economic growth.
The Group has established positions in these markets and is well situated to take advantage of the potential for further growth.
In excess of 90% of our 2018 turnover has already been secured and it is expected that the balance will be achieved from carefully selected projects during the first half of this year.
We remain confident in the outlook for the Group and expect the positive progress achieved to continue into 2018 and beyond.

Risks
Introduction
NM Groups approach to risk management is guided by its core values strategic priorities and related objectives.
It regards its risk attitude as the amount of risk that it is willing to accept in order to deliver its strategic priorities.
The Board recognises the importance of risk in the running of its business that circumstances are continuously changing and that the risks therefore need to remain under regular review.
The Board has made a robust assessment of the principal risks which the Group faces the controls in place to remove or mitigate these risks and also whether these risks represent new increased or decreased threats.
The assessment of these risks and controls is part of the ongoing management of the business.
The principal risks that could adversely impact the Groups profitability and ability to achieve its strategic objectives are set out in the table on pages 40 to 43.
Risk Management Framework
Operating in the construction industry risk is at the heart of everything we do.
We therefore have wellembedded risk and control processes in place to manage both material and dayto day circumstances.
2017 saw the continuing strengthening of the risk management culture and disciplines embedding the Groups strategic priorities and related objectives.
The Group recognises that consistent and effective risk management is vital to the delivery of its strategic development and business objectives.
The Groups risk and governance model is designed so that the Board maintains overall responsibility for risk.
Each division identifies controls and mitigates threats within their operations.
The reporting structure ensures that once the risk appetite is determined by the Board risks are managed within acceptable tolerance levels.
Senior managers within the divisions take ownership of specific business risks.
Risk is managed across the Group in the following ways The Group and its divisions undertake a comprehensive annual business planning process to identify objectives and set strategies to achieve their goals taking account of the risk appetite set by the Board.
A SMART plan is developed by the divisions and the central Group functions.
The Chief Executive and Finance Director meet with the divisions monthly throughout the year and with an established agenda and reporting format covering a range of matters.
This allows the Chief Executive and Finance Director to ensure that they maintain oversight and control over the material aspects of strategic financial operational and risk issues.
Tendering opportunities including pre qualification questionnaires and framework submissions are assessed based on the strategic objectives of the divisions.
Governance levels are set according to risk appetite but includes significant involvement from the Chief Executive and Finance Director.
The Groups Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring and ensuring that the internal commercial audit remains efficient and effective.
The committee annually approves the internal commercial audit plan which covers both project and corporate level risks.
The plan is developed by focusing upon the principal risks identified from the risk review process and feedback from current divisional performance.
The internal commercial audit team reports regularly to the Board and the Audit Committee on its findings.
The Group has a number of initiatives under way to continually strengthen the risk management of the Group and acceptance and delivery of individual contracts.
These include tender review procedures programme development and early supply chain involvement.
These projects are being driven from the Groups Commercial Forum and the Executive Leadership Team.
38 North Midland Construction PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 25748 5 April 2018 1124 AM Proof 14 Going Concern and Viability Statement The Strategic Report on pages 08 to 53 sets out details of the Group s marketplace business model and Group strategy as well as an overview of divisional strategy including both operational and financial performance.
Further information on the key performance indicators principal risks and material uncertainties affecting NM Group can be found on pages 26 to 27 and 38 to 43.
Starting on page 38 the risk disclosures section of the consolidated financial statements sets out the principal risks the Group is exposed to including people performance and financial compliance together with the Group s policies for monitoring managing and mitigating its exposures to these risks.
The Board considers annually and on a rolling basis a threeyear strategic plan for the business which the Group progressively implements.
The threeyear strategic plan was last approved by the Board on 13 December 2017.
One of the strengths of the Group is the number of longterm frameworks secured and repeat business with blue chip clients.
This gives a longerterm sustainable baseline of work which the Board deems to be of a lower risk profile and this is in line with the longerterm strategy of the Group.
During 2017 the Board carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group including those that would threaten its business model future performance solvency or liquidity.
The Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully in the current economic climate.
Accordingly the Board believes that taking into account the Group s current position and subject to the principal risks faced by the business the Group will be able to continue in operation and to meet its liabilities as they fall due for the period up to 31 December 2020 being the period considered under the Group s current threeyear strategic plan.
The financial forecasts included in the strategic plan have been subjected to stress testing using the following potential occurrences Reduction in creditor payment cycle AMP cycle revenue downturn within the Water segment Reduced margin or potential lossmaking contracts Potential failure in supply chain As part of the strategic plan the Board has reviewed its capital structure and any requirement for additional financing during the period to 31 December 2020.
After making enquiries the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue its operational existence for the foreseeable future and for a period of at least 12 months from the date of this report.
Accordingly the Board continues to adopt and consider appropriate the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.

Accountability and Review The Board is fully aware of its duty to present a balanced and understandable assessment of the Groups position and prospects and this is included in the Chairmans Statement and Strategic Report.
The Board has overall responsibility for the Groups systems of internal financial control and for monitoring their effectiveness.
The system of internal controls is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of business failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Directors have established an organisation structure with clear operating procedures lines of responsibility and delegated authority within the limitations of the size of the business.
These controls are established in order to safeguard the Groups assets maintain proper accounting records and ensure that financial information used within the business or published is reliable.
The risk management processes were in place for the full year to 31 December 2017 and up to the date of approval of this report.
The procedures are constantly reviewed throughout the year along with the operational risks across the Group and prioritisation of those risks identified for further action.
This is carried out primarily at a management level and reported up to the Board.
The Board has not undertaken a formal annual review of the effectiveness of the internal controls.
The size of the Company and the close involvement of the Executive Directors ensures a sound system of internal control is maintained.
Going Concern Based on normal business planning and control procedures the Directors confirm that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
The Board regularly reviews financial statements cash balances and forecasts to ensure that the going concern state of affairs continues to prevail.
Audit Committee The Board has constituted an Audit Committee which comprises three independent NonExecutive Directors Mr SJT Brown Chairman Mr I Elliott and Mr DP Rogers.
The Board is satisfied that they have recent and relevant financial experience to analyse and when necessary to challenge the information contained in or the presentation of management accounts and statutory financial statements.
The Chairman Chief Executive and the Finance Director attend Committee meetings for specific purposes at the agreement of the Committee.
The Committee is responsible for reviewing the nature and scope of the external audit and the results of that audit any internal control issues raised by them and management responses.
In addition the Committee reviews the independence and objectivity of the external Auditor.
BDO LLP currently carries out routine tax compliance work see note 8 for fees charged.
The Committee takes the view that carrying out this nonaudit work does not affect BDO LLPs objectivity or independence given the extent of fees charged for nonaudit services and it does not fall within the definition of accounting services.
The review of interim and annual financial statements and the appointment and remuneration of the external Auditor are considered by the Board as a whole.
During the year the Committee met on four occasions and all members were present.
The external Auditor was invited and attended these meetings.
Relations with Shareholders The Company is predominantly a familyowned business and has only a small number of institutional shareholders.
The
Board endeavours to maintain dialogue with its shareholders by means of periodic financial reporting via Trading updates as required by the UK Listing Authoritys Disclosure and Transparency Rules Interim results at the half year the Annual Report and at Annual General Meetings.
Details of these together with related press releases are available at the Companys website site.
Code of Best Practice Throughout the year ended 31 December 2017 the Company has been compliant with the UK Corporate Governance Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council in the UK with the exception of the matters referred to below which arise solely due to the size of the Company and the burden of increased costs should the Company wish to comply.
DA Taylor is the Company Secretary a role he combines with his responsibilities as Finance Director.
The Audit Committee has reviewed the necessity and value of an internal commercial audit function and agreed the continuation of the project monitoring programme in relation to commercial and contractual risk on contracts.
The Company is utilising internal expertise from across divisions to deliver the internal commercial audit function which adds to the development of the employees involved and encourages best practice across all divisions.

Steve Brown  NonExecutive Chairman Audit Committee This year we have hopefully put together a report which is transparent yet concise and shows not only what we have done but how we did it in 2017.
Who are we The Audit Committee is made up of three independent Non Executive Directors Ian Elliott David Rogers and myself Steve

Advising the Board on whether the financial statements are fair balanced and understandable and if they provide the information necessary for the shareholders to assess the Group performance business model and strategy.
The Audit Committee has responsibility for a number of other matters and you will find information on these and other documents that are pertinent to understanding the Audit Committees role and remit on our website www. orthmid.
Financial Reporting Council letter The Company received a letter from the Financial Reporting Councils FRC Corporate Reporting Review Team on 1 February 2017 asking certain questions about some disclosure matters in our annual report for the year ended 31 December 2015.
The Company responded fully to the matters raised in the FRCs letter enabling it to conclude its enquiry.
As a result of the FRCs enquiry the Company has made improvements to the disclosures in this annual report in the following areas the effect of legacy contracts on business performance in both the strategic report and the financial statements the analysis of the business development performance and financial position in the strategic report and the disclosures in respect of any significant accounting judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty arising in respect of construction contracts in the financial statements.
The FRCs enquiry did not result in any change to reported profit or net assets.
We recognise that the FRCs review was based on a review of our annual report for the year ended 31 December 2015 and did not benefit from detailed knowledge of the Companys business or an understanding of the underlying transactions entered into.
Its review did not provide any assurance that the Companys annual report and financial statements are correct in all material respects.
The committee also noted that the only significant item raised as part of the FRCs Audit Quality Review of the external audit concerned the one remaining legacy contract and the disclosures in respect of any significant accounting judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty arising in respect of construction contracts in the financial statements.
External audit The Committee formally met with the external Auditor BDO LLP  during the year end process to discuss the nature and scope of the audit to review in some detail the audit plan and lastly to review the outcome of the audit and to discuss issues arising and their resolution.
When meeting with the Auditor we reviewed the Groups accounting policies to ensure that they remained appropriate and discussed in broad terms the major risks that the Auditor was likely to consider during their work.
These are set out in the Auditors own report but included profits recognised on contracts recoverability of trade receivables and going concern.
We also discussed fees which are set out in note 8 and all other relationships which may have a bearing on the Auditors independence.
We also discussed the judgements and uncertainties inherent in the preparation of the financial statements with the Auditor and how these areas were dealt with by the Group which are set out in note 4.
These matters are as follows Recognition of revenue and attributable profit or losses on contracts The Auditor anticipated this to be an area of significant risk because the extent of revenue and profit or loss recognised on a partially completed contract represents an area of judgement.
The Board where necessary has taken expert advice on the value of certain problematic contracts recognised in the financial statements.
These experts have been used to give opinion on the legal substance and quantum measurement where appropriate.
The Audit Committee reviewed and agreed with the use of such experts and the process the Board has undertaken to ensure that these contracts were reflected accurately in the financial statements.
Recoverability of construction contracts and trade receivables The Auditor assessed the recoverability of trade receivables to be an area of significant risk as a result of the sector and the characteristics of the contracting environment.
The Board where necessary has taken expert advice on the value of certain problematic contracts recognised in the financial statements.
These experts have been used to give opinion on the legal substance and quantum measurement where appropriate.
The Audit Committee reviewed and agreed with the use of such experts and the process the Board has undertaken to ensure that these contracts were reflected accurately in the financial statements which are set out in note 4.
Audit plan The Committee agreed the audit plan with the Auditor having paid particular regard to issues of scope and materiality.
The
Committee also agreed the external Auditor remuneration.
Annual report We have discussed the presentation of the annual report both in the context of the increasing acceptance of the concept of integrated reporting and also in view of the difficulties shareholders commented on in relation to the ever increasing complexity of the financial statements.

At our final meeting with the Auditor prior to signing the annual report we discussed the resolution of the risks that the Auditor had identified above.
The Audit Committee recognised and agreed with the Boards use of external experts.
The Audit Committee concluded that the experts who are independent and drawn from a variety of relevant disciplines have provided opinions on the legal merits and the quantum evaluations of the specific contracts.
In the discharge of its duties the Audit Committee has had regard to the expert opinions and the advice and guidance within them.
It has also reviewed the processes which the Board has adopted to ensure that the specific contracts were properly reported in the Financial Statements including that they accurately reflected the experts views.
Other fees paid to our external Auditor In terms of nonaudit services these have been limited to tax compliance related to the audit and amounted to 12000 2016 11000.
All such activities have to be agreed by this
We are satisfied based on the level of fees and the use of separate departments that the Auditor independence has been maintained.
Effectiveness of our Auditor We are currently reviewing the effectiveness of the external
In doing so we plan to speak to the Finance Director the Chief Executive and a selection of the Groups senior financial management within each business unit.
We will ask them to complete a questionnaire as we did last year which will provide an objective scoring system around aspects of technical quality and of service quality.
However at this stage we remain satisfied that our Auditor is delivering an effective service on behalf of shareholders in terms of the necessary scrupulousness and challenge in their work and also in terms of supporting the annual report process effectively.
We shall continue to review this on an annual basis.
BDO LLP have been our Auditor since 2010 there are no contractual obligations surrounding their appointment.
Our last tender was in 2010 at which time our current auditor was first appointed.
Internal commercial audit The Audit Committee feel that undertaking commercial and contractual peer reviews of certain contracts known internally as contract project monitoring is imperative to mitigate the inherent risk within the construction industry in which the Group operates.
The Audit Committee continued a project monitoring programme in relation to commercial and contractual risk and this review will be enhanced to assess risk assessments prior to pricing of tenders.
This aligns with the key strategic focus of preventing losses.
The Company is utilising internal expertise from all divisions to deliver the internal commercial audit function.
The reports produced are reviewed by the Committee during the year by exception.
A summary of progress is issued at every Board meeting along with a timetable for upcoming reviews.
The Committee continually reviewed the requirement for internal audit by an external body.
Financial statements The financial statements and the annual report as a whole are the responsibility of the entire Board.
Their responsibility statement is contained in the Report of the Directors on page 81 but the Board looks to the Audit Committee to advise it in relation to the financial statements both as regards their form and content issues which might arise and on specific areas which require judgement such as the going concern presumption.
The Board believes the annual report taken as a whole is fair balanced and understandable.
In order to be able to advise the Board that the annual report is fair balanced and understandable we spent some time deciding what we felt this meant and who our key stakeholders were and what this would mean for them.
We decided that the annual report should be free from bias tell the story of the Company for this financial year accurately and make sense to the reader.
Going concern review The Committee review the going concern and viability position.
Particular attention was given to both the liquidity and solvency position envisaged by the report for the period 12 months from this date and the foreseeable future as set out in the Boards strategic plan.
Future plans We will of course continue to perform our duties as set out in our terms of reference over the course of the next year.
However there are a number of matters which we will be concentrating on as the year progresses including A review of the effectiveness of the internal commercial audit function and potential enhancements to its scope as well as a continual review of the requirement for internal audit by an external body and A review of the effectiveness of the Audit Committee.

Report
Although the maximum bonus potential for our annual bonus has been increased for 2018 we believe that our bonus plan remains appropriate.
The increased potential under this bonus plan will only be delivered if future performance targets are achieved.
As this plan is based primarily on profits before tax any additional incentive pay earned will be appropriately self funded as part of the attainment of the PBT targets.
Stepping back from the detail we believe that our Executive Directors are very important to the continued development of NM Group and particularly to the fulfilment of our ongoing growth plans.
Accordingly we believe that the changes which we have made for our Executive Directors will have a materially retentive impact and that the path which we are taking is clearly in shareholders best interests.
For completeness the salary for our Executive Chairman in 2018 will remain unchanged from 2017 levels 2017 base salary 369000.
The Executive Chairman has waived his entitlement to an annual bonus for the year ended 31 December 2017.
He has also agreed not to be included in the annual bonus scheme from 1 January 2018 onwards.
Whilst not a matter for the Remuneration Committee for 2018 the Board has increased NonExecutive Directors fees to 40000 for 2018 2017 36000.
Shareholder approval The regulations governing the directors remuneration reports of listed companies require that we split our report into two sections a Policy Report which sets out the Companys forwardlooking Directors Remuneration Policy and a separate Implementation Report which gives details of the payments made to Directors in 2017 as well as other required disclosures.
As we are retaining our existing policy for which Shareholder approval was obtained at the 2016 AGM we will only be holding one vote on remuneration matters at the forthcoming AGM that being an advisory vote on the Implementation
I hope that you will continue to be supportive of our Executive remuneration policy and practices and that you will vote in favour of the Implementation Report at the 2018 AGM.
On a final note from 1 April 2018 I will be stepping down as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee but will remain a member.
Mr I Elliott has accepted the role from that date.
Yours sincerely SJT Brown NonExecutive Chairman Remuneration Committee 27 March 2018 Remuneration Committee Chairmans Letter Dear Shareholder I am pleased to present the Directors Remuneration Report for 2017.
This report has been prepared following a year in which the Group has seen a growth in turnover of 16.48% to 291.77 million 2016 250.49 million.
Although the Operating Profit achieved of 1.19 million 2016 2.24 million is below the Boards and Committees expectations the Underlying profitability of the continuing divisional segments has increased significantly to 8.30 million 2016 5.91 million which is testament to the continued efforts of the Executive Board members together with Groups other management and all employees.
Whilst we remain cautious in our overall outlook on executive pay during 2017 we took actions all of which were within the scope of our shareholders approved remuneration policy which we felt were appropriate to reward our strongly performing executive team fairly.
The changes can be summarised as follows Pay element Detail Base salaries for 2018 John Homer  310000 2017 277000 Dan Taylor  180000 2017 160000 Andy Langman  160000 2017 150000 Stuart Proud  160000 2017 150000 Annual Bonus for 2018 Executive Directors maximum bonus opportunity increased to 60% of base salary 2017 50% of base salary max We believe that it is correct to recognise the strong performance of our Executive Directors and other top performing staff.
This has resulted in significantly improved underlying financial performance by the Group which in turn has driven good returns for our shareholders and increased the size of the business.
The share price increase from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017 was 83% from 1.80 per share to 3.30 per share noting the slight deterioration since the year end with the current price at 2.98 per share.
We recognise that these salary increases are above normal payinflation levels but we believe that when setting the levels of remuneration for the Executive Directors it is important to take particular care to ensure that the base salaries are commensurate to the increased size and complexity of their roles.
The growth in turnover of 16.48% and the forecast turnover growth in turnover for 2018 of 13.0% is one of the areas taken in to consideration.
We have also externally benchmarked these remuneration packages and are satisfied that these are in line with market rates.

Introduction and Policy
This report contains the material required to be set out as the Directors Remuneration Report for the purposes of Part 4 of The Large and Mediumsized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013 which amended The Large and Mediumsized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 the DRR Regulations.
Shareholder approval was obtained at the 2016 AGM for our Directors Remuneration Policy and we are not proposing to make any changes to this policy which will continue to apply for the forthcoming year.
For ease of reference Part A below sets out the key features of our policy.
The full policy is as disclosed in last years Annual Report.
Part A is not subject to a vote at the 2018 AGM.
Part B constitutes the implementation sections of the Remuneration Report Implementation Report.
The Auditor has reported on certain parts of the Implementation Report and stated whether in their opinion those parts have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
Those parts of the Implementation Report which have been subject to audit are clearly indicated.
Part B is subject to an advisory vote at the 2018 AGM.
Part A Directors Remuneration Policy The following table summarises the key features of our Directors Remuneration Policy.
The policy has been developed mindful of the Corporate Governance Code and is felt to be appropriate to support the longterm success of the Company whilst ensuring that it does not promote inappropriate risktaking.
For completeness the scenario charts have been updated to reflect revisions to the Executive Directors packages for 2018.
For the avoidance of doubt we are bound by the Directors Remuneration Policy as published in the 2015 Annual Report.
Element and Purpose Policy and Operation Maximum Performance Measures Executive Directors Base salary This is the core element of pay and reflects the individuals role and position within the Group with some adjustment to reflect their capability and contribution.
Base salaries will be reviewed each year by the Committee.
The Committee does not strictly follow benchmark pay data but uses the median position as a reference point in considering in its judgement the appropriate level of salary having regard to other relevant factors including corporate and individual performance and any changes in an individuals role and responsibilities.
Base salary is paid monthly through the payroll.
The Executive Directors salaries will not be increased so as to exceed the median for the equivalent roles in companies listed in the FTSE SmallCap Index.
Normally
Executive Directors base salaries will not be increased by more than the average awarded to staff.
However during the life of this policy it may be necessary to make higher increases to bring the Executive Directors salaries closer to an appropriate market rate andor to reflect i an increase in scope of role responsibilities ii any changes to other elements of an Executive Directors package.

To provide benefits valued by recipients.
The Executive Directors receive private health care cover a company car or car allowance and a company fuel card.
The Committee reserves discretion to introduce new benefits where it concludes that it is appropriate to do so having regard to the particular circumstances and to market practice.
Where appropriate the Company will meet certain costs relating to Executive Director relocations.
It is not possible to prescribe the likely change in the cost of insured benefits or the cost of some of the other reported benefits yeartoyear but the provision of benefits will operate within an annual limit of 50000 per Executive plus a further 100% of base salary in the case of relocations.
The Committee will monitor the costs of benefits in practice and will ensure that the overall costs do not increase by more than the Committee considers appropriate in all the circumstances.
NA
Pension
To provide retirement benefits.
Executive Directors can receive pension contributions to personal pension arrangements or if a Director is impacted by annual or lifetime limits on contribution levels to qualifying pension plans the balance can be paid as a cash supplement andor consolidated into base salary.
The maximum employers contribution is limited to up to 25% of base salary although it is not currently anticipated that pension provision for the Executive Directors will be at this level.

68 North Midland Construction PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 25748 5 April 2018 1124 AM Proof 14 Element and Purpose Policy and Operation Maximum Performance Measures Annual Bonus Plan To motivate Executives and incentivise delivery of performance over a oneyear operating cycle focusing on the short to mediumterm elements of our strategic aims.
Annual Bonus Plan levels and the appropriateness of measures are reviewed annually at the commencement of each financial year to ensure they continue to support our strategy.
Once set performance measures and targets will generally remain unchanged for the year except to reflect events such as corporate acquisitions or other major transactions where the Committee considers it to be necessary in its opinion to make appropriate adjustments.
Annual Bonus Plan outcomes are paid in cash following the determination of achievement against performance measures and targets albeit that a portion of the bonus can be deferred and payable a year later.
Clawbackmalus provisions apply to the Annual Bonus Plan as explained in more detail in the relevant note to the policy table which does not form part of the policy itself.
The maximum annual bonus that can be earned is 75% of base salary for the duration of this policy.
To the extent that the actual maximum bonus opportunity in any year was less than 75% the Committee can in exceptional circumstances agree to pay a higher bonus than originally contemplated up to but not exceeding the overriding 75% salary cap.
The performance measures applied may be financial or nonfinancial and corporate divisional or individual and in such proportions as the Committee considers appropriate.
The Committees current intention is that for a threshold level of performance a bonus of up to 30% of salary can be paid.
The
Annual Bonus Plan remains a discretionary arrangement and the Committee retains a standard power to apply its judgement to adjust the outcome of the Annual Bonus Plan for any performance measure from zero to any cap should it consider that to be appropriate.
Further details of measures their weighting and targets will be disclosed in the relevant Annual Report on
69 North Midland Construction PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 GOVERNANCE 25748 5 April 2018 1124 AM Proof 14 Element and Purpose Policy and Operation Maximum Performance Measures LongTerm Incentives Provided under the Performance Share Plan PSP to motivate and incentivise delivery of sustained performance and alignment with shareholders.
The primary ongoing long term incentive plan is the Performance Share Plan.
Awards can be granted as conditional shares or a nil nominal cost option vesting subject to the achievement of threeyear performance conditions.
Awards can be satisfied by shares andor cash.
A payment equivalent to the dividends that would have accrued on the number of shares that vest may be made to participants on vesting as cash or shares.
PSP awards are subject to clawbackmalus provisions described more fully in the relevant note to the policy table which does not form part of the policy itself.
Awards over shares worth up to 100% of salary can be granted each year or such higher number as the Committee considers appropriate in exceptional circumstances up to a maximum of 200%.
Details of any awards granted in a year will be disclosed in the relevant Annual Report on
The Committee may set such performance conditions on PSP awards as it considers appropriate whether financial or nonfinancial and whether corporate divisional or individual.
Once set performance measures and targets will generally remain unaltered unless events occur which in the Committees opinion make it appropriate to substitute vary or waive the performance conditions in such manner as the Committee thinks fit.
Performance periods may be over such periods as the Committee selects at grant which will not be less than but may be longer than three years.
No more than 25% of awards vest for attaining the threshold level of performance for each condition.

The Company operates an HMRCapproved Share Incentive Plan which follows the usual form for such plans.
Executive Directors are able to participate in the plan on the same terms as other Group employees.
The maximum participation levels for the plan are set by HMRC from time to time.
Consistent with normal practice such awards are not subject to performance conditions.
NonExecutive Directors NonExecutive Director
To enable the Company to recruit and retain Non Executive Directors of the highest calibre at the appropriate cost.
The fees paid to Non Executive Directors aim to be competitive with other fully listed companies of equivalent size and complexity.
The fees payable to the NonExecutive Directors are determined by the Board.
In the normal course Non Executive Directors will not be granted awards under any incentive arrangements.
The Company reserves the right to provide benefits including travel and office support within the prescribed limits.
Fees are paid monthly through payroll.
The aggregate fees and any benefits of the NonExecutive Directors will not exceed 250000 in aggregate.
Any increases actually made will be appropriately disclosed.

Notes to the policy table Malus and clawback for information and not part of the Directors Remuneration Policy Malus being the forfeiture of any deferred element of incentive pay including PSP awards and clawback being the ability of the Company to claim repayment as a debt of any net element of incentive pay previously paid provisions can be applied by the
If the Committee becomes aware that the financial or other results that they used to determine an incentive payout were incorrect which resulted in an overpayment andor if the Committee becomes aware of an act or omission by an Executive Director that justifies or would at the time have justified summary dismissal the Committee can apply malus andor clawback on any incentive payment declared up to three years prior to the relevant event coming to light.
Stating maximum amounts for the remuneration policy The DRR Regulations and related investor guidance encourages companies to disclose a cap within which each element of the Directors Remuneration Policy will operate.
Where maximum amounts for elements of remuneration have been set within the above these will operate simply as caps and are not indicative of any aspiration.
Travel and hospitality While the Committee does not consider travel and hospitality to form part of benefits in the normal usage of that term it has been advised that corporate hospitality whether paid for by the Company or another party and business travel for Directors and exceptionally their families may technically come within the applicable rules and so the Committee expressly reserves the right for the Committee to authorise such activities within its agreed policies.
Differences between the policy on remuneration for Directors from the policy on remuneration of other employees While the appropriate benchmarks vary by role the Company seeks to apply the philosophy behind this policy across the Company as a whole.
Where the Companys pay policy for Directors differs from its pay policies for groups of employees this reflects the appropriate market rate for the relevant roles.
The Company takes into account pay levels and bonus opportunity applied across the Group as a whole when setting the Executive Directors Remuneration Policy.
71 North Midland Construction PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 GOVERNANCE 25748 5 April 2018 1124 AM Proof 14 Outstanding obligations The Company will honour any commitments entered into prior to the approval and introduction of this policy.
Pension contributions An Executive Director may elect to surrender salary or annual bonus outcomes in return for additional contributions to pension arrangements being made by the Company on his behalf.
Any such amounts surrendered are regarded as part of the original pay element for the purposes of this policy rather than as amounts counting towards the maximum employers pension contribution stated in the table above.
If the Company elects to increase the additional pension contribution to reflect any related employers NICs saving any such increases to reflect employers NICs will be regarded as additional employers pension contributions for the purposes of this policy.
Committee discretions The Committee will operate the Annual Bonus Plan and PSP according to their respective rules and the above policy table.
The Committee retains discretion consistent with market practice in a number of respects in relation to the operation and administration of these plans.
These discretions include but are not limited to the following The timing of grant of an awardbonus opportunity The size of an awardbonus opportunity subject to the maximum limits set out in the policy table The determination of performance against targets and resultant vestingbonus payouts Discretion required when dealing with a change of control or restructuring of the Group Determination of the treatment of leavers based on the rules of the plan and the appropriate treatment chosen Adjustments required in certain circumstances e.
The annual review of performance measures weightings and targets from year to year.
In addition while performance measures and targets used in the Annual Bonus Plan and PSP will generally remain unaltered if events occur which in the Committees opinion would make a different or amended target a fairer measure of performance such amended or different target can be set provided that it is not materially more or less difficult to satisfy having regard to the event in question.
Any use of these discretions would where relevant be explained in the Directors Remuneration Report and may where appropriate and practicable be the subject of consultation with the Companys major shareholders.
The
Committee may make minor amendments to the policy set out above for regulatory exchange control tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation without obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment.
Share ownership guidelines Any vested shares under the proposed new Performance Share Plan must unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise be retained unlessuntil the Executive Director holds shares worth at least 100% of salary.
Recruitment remuneration policy The Companys recruitment remuneration policy aims to give the Committee sufficient flexibility to secure the appointment and promotion of highcalibre Executives to strengthen the management team and secure the skill sets to deliver our strategic aims.
The main features of this policy are described below.
In terms of the principles for setting a package for a new Executive Director the starting point for the Committee will be to apply the general policy for Executive Directors as set out above and structure a package in accordance with that policy.
Consistent with the DRR Regulations the caps contained within the policy for fixed pay do not apply to new recruits although the Committee would not envisage exceeding these caps in practice.
The Annual Bonus Plan and PSP will operate including the maximum award levels as detailed in the general policy in relation to any newly appointed Executive Director.
For an internal appointment any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may either continue on its original terms or be adjusted to reflect the new appointment as appropriate.
For external and internal appointments the Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation expenses as it considers appropriate.
For external candidates it may be necessary to make additional awards in connection with the recruitment to buyout awards forfeited by the individual on leaving a previous employer.
For the avoidance of doubt buyout awards are not subject to a formal cap.
Any recruitmentrelated awards which are not buyouts will be subject to the limits for Annual Bonus Plan and PSP as stated in the general policy.
Details of any recruitment related awards will be appropriately disclosed.
For any buyouts the Company will not pay more than is in the view of the Committee necessary and will in all cases seek in the first instance to deliver any such awards under the terms of the existing Annual Bonus Plan and PSP .
It may however be necessary in some cases to make buyout awards on terms that are more bespoke than the existing Annual Bonus Plan or PSP e. periods.
All buyouts whether under the Annual Bonus Plan PSP or otherwise will take account of the service obligations and performance requirements for any remuneration relinquished by the individual when leaving a previous employer.
The
Committee will seek to make buyouts subject to what are in
Policy
72 North Midland Construction PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 25748 5 April 2018 1124 AM Proof 14 its opinion comparable requirements in respect of service and performance.
However the Committee may choose to relax this requirement in certain cases such as where the service andor performance requirements are materially completed or where such factors are in the view of the Committee reflected in some other way such as a significant discount to the face value of the awards forfeited and where the Committee considers it to be in the interests of shareholders.
A new NonExecutive Director would be recruited on the same terms as explained above in respect of the main policy for such
Service Contracts None of the Executive Directors has a service contract which exceeds one year.
The current notice periods are six months for all Executives.
Copies of these contracts are kept at the Companys registered office.
The NonExecutive Directors have letters of appointment.
They are engaged for specific terms and their reappointment will not be automatic.
The date of each Executive Directors contract is Name Date of latest contract R Moyle March 2015 J Homer June 2016 DA Taylor February 2013 A Langman January 2018 DS Proud March 2015 Termination policy summary The Committee will consider treatments on a termination having regard to all of the relevant facts and circumstances available at that time the provisions of service contracts and the terms of any incentive arrangement.
This policy applies both to any negotiations linked to notice periods on a termination and any treatments that the Committee may choose to apply under the discretions available to it under the terms of the Annual Bonus Plan PSP or other incentive arrangement.
Under the PSP  if during the performance or vesting period a participant i. ii. iii.
Committee so decides immediately on the participant ceasing to be in employment.
Awards will be prorated by reference to the proportion of the performance period for which the participant remained employed unless the Committee determines otherwise.
The Company has the power to enter into settlement agreements with Directors and to pay compensation to settle potential legal claims.
In addition and consistent with market practice in the event of the termination of an Executive Director the Company may make a contribution towards that individuals legal fees and fees for outplacement services as part of a negotiated settlement.
Any such fees will be disclosed as part of the detail of termination arrangements.
For the avoidance of doubt the policy does not include an explicit cap on the cost of termination payments.
External appointments The Companys policy is to permit an Executive Director to serve as a nonexecutive director elsewhere when this does not conflict with the individuals duties to the Company.
Where an Executive Director takes such a role whether they are entitled to retain any fees which they earn from that appointment will be considered on a case by case basis.
No Executive Directors currently hold any external appointments.
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group Pay and employment conditions generally in the Group are taken into account when setting Executive Directors remuneration.
The Committee receives regular updates on overall pay and conditions in the Group including but not limited to changes in base pay and any staff bonus pools in operation.
There is also oversight of the allemployee share schemes which Executive Directors and all other Group employees can participate in on the same terms and conditions.
Reflecting standard practice the Company did not consult with employees in drawing up this Remuneration Report.
Statement of consideration of shareholder views The Committee ensures that its major shareholders are consulted in advance of any material changes in Executive pay practices at the Company.
The Committee also considers any feedback which it receives from its shareholders in relation to remuneration.

Any dividends paid outside of these parameters would be deemed exceptional by the Board.
The current years dividends declared of 6.0p 2016 4.5p is exceptional based on the policy parameters but has been proposed due to the underlying profitability the cash generation and the secured workload for 2018.

Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that in our professional judgment were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement whether or not due to fraud we identified including those which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
86 North Midland Construction PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 25748 3 April 2018 452 PM Proof 14 Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter Recognition of revenue and attributable profit or losses on contracts Refer to page 62 Audit Committee Report and notes 2 and 4 to the financial statements for the Directors disclosures of the related accounting policies judgments and estimates.
Revenue and attributable profit or loss is recognised on the stage of completion of individual contracts and frameworks calculated on the proportion of total costs incurred at the reporting date as compared to the projected total costs at completion.
Expected losses are recognised immediately as an expense.
The extent of revenue and profit  loss to recognise on a particular partially completed contract represents an area of significant judgement within the financial statements which involves an assessment of both current and future contract performance.
The potential outcomes for contracts can have an individual or collectively material impact on the financial statements whether through error or management bias.
Legacy contracts which carry a high contractual and commercial risk may be subject to estimation uncertainty.
For a selection of contracts from each operating segment we obtained a copy of the contract documentation and critically assessed and challenged the recognition of revenue from review of the performance of the contract.
We substantively tested the revenue figures as applied to the contracts throughout the year.
We tested the controls governing applications for payment and recognition of WIP  the application of payroll subcontractor and purchasing costs to the contracts ledger for operational effectiveness throughout the year.
We assessed the position adopted by management at the year end as compared to external evidence being customers certification of work done or other relevant correspondence.
We carried out a detailed review of the post year end performance of the contracts to corroborate estimates taken at the year end in respect of costs expected to be incurred and challenged assumptions which appeared inconsistent with actual post year end performance.
Groups of contracts negotiated as a single framework were reviewed to ensure they were accounted for on a weighted average basis and accurately reflected the overall performance of the contract.
We assessed the reliability of management estimates in light of the positions adopted in previous years compared to actual outturn.
We reviewed legal and experts reports instructed and received on contentious issues and contracts.
We considered the specific accounting entries and disclosure of legacy contracts.
Recoverability of trade receivables and amounts recoverable under construction contracts Refer to page 62 Audit Committee Report and notes 2 and 4 to the financial statements for the Directors disclosures of the related accounting policies judgments and estimates.
This area was assessed as a significant risk because construction contract assets trade receivables and amounts recoverable under construction contracts may be subject to complex negotiated settlements or dispute.
We identified individual trade receivable and amounts recoverable under construction contract balances which we considered presented the greatest risk of exposure either by size or by age.
Where possible we corroborated the year end trade receivables to post year end payments and customer remittances.
Where construction contract assets had not been supported by external certifications we agreed the balance to QS applications at the year end and where applicable external expert quantification opinions.
If payment had not been received we inspected correspondence with the customer including customer certifications of applications made for payment and customer payment history to assess the recoverability of the debt.
We challenged managements assessment of the recoverability of trade receivables and construction contract balances in light of the evidence available to us including a review of legal and experts reports instructed and received on contentious issues.
We inspected a sample of retention balances and in each case we corroborated the value of the retention to customer correspondence and confirmed when the retention was due.
For all retentions that were due we reviewed the status of the project and formed a conclusion on the recoverability of the balance in light of the evidence presented.

Auditors Report
Our application of materiality We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing our audit and in evaluating the effect of misstatements.
For planning we consider materiality to be the magnitude by which misstatements including omissions could influence the economic decisions of reasonable users that are taken on the basis of the financial statements.
In order to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that any misstatements exceed materiality we use a lower materiality level performance materiality to determine the extent of testing needed.
Importantly misstatements below these levels will not necessarily be evaluated as immaterial as we also take account of the nature of identified misstatements and the particular circumstances of their occurrence when evaluating their effect on the financial statements as a whole.
We determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole to be 414000 2016 1850000 for the Group and 364000 2016 1500000 for the Company.
In determining this we based our assessment on 5% of underlying profit 2016 0.75% of turnover.
We believe that underlying profit as defined on page 1 of the annual report represents one of the principal key performance indicators for the Group and Parent Company and is a generally accepted auditing benchmark.
Performance materiality was set at 75% of the above materiality levels based on a strong control environment and a low level of expected misstatements.
Whilst materiality for the financial statements of the Group as a whole was 414000 each component of the Group was audited to a lower level of materiality.
Audits of the components were performed at a materiality level calculated by reference to a proportion of Group materiality appropriate to the relative scale of the business concerned.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report for their consideration all individual audit differences in excess of 8280 and 7280 for the Group and Company respectively.
We also agreed to report differences below this threshold that in our view warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements The Group audit strategy was risk based and the nature and extent of our testing was established by concluding on the areas we considered represented a significant risk of material misstatement.
In making this assessment we Assessed the degree of estimation uncertainty associated with the judgements taken by the Directors during the preparation of the financial statements taking into account external factors which could result in management bias.
This was specifically focused in the extent of profit or loss recognised on certain contracts.
We inspected the performance of the six operating divisions inclusive of joint operations and selected certain contracts from each operating segment which we considered presented the greatest risk of material misstatement for detailed testing.
Critically assessed the Group control environment and internal systems used to generate the following key accounting entries revenue direct material costs subcontractor costs payroll stock and work in progress.
Comparatively reviewed the performance of the Group against our expectations based on our knowledge of the Group other relevant sector knowledge the external economic conditions and historic performance and trends.
Considered nonroutine or unusual transactions which have an inherent risk of material error.
Our Group audit scope focused on the trading Parent Company North Midland Construction PLC and trading subsidiary Nomenca Limited which were both subject to a full scope audit by the Group audit team.
These entities represent the principal business units of the Group and account for 100% of the Groups revenue 100% of the Groups profit before tax and 100% of the Groups total assets.

Auditors Report
Matters on which we are required to report by exception In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Parent Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Directors Report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if in our opinion adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us or the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns or certain disclosures of Directors remuneration specified by law are not made or we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of Directors As explained more fully in the Directors responsibilities statement the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements the Directors are responsible for assessing the Groups and the Parent Companys ability to continue as a going concern disclosing as applicable matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditors report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs UK will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if individually or in the aggregate they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Councils website at www. rc. iteauditorsresponsibilities.
This description forms part of our auditors report.
Other matters which we are required to address Following the recommendation of the Audit Committee we were appointed by the members on 14 December 2010 to audit the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2010 and subsequent financial periods.
The period of total uninterrupted engagement is 8 years covering the years ending 31 December 2010 to 31 December 2017.
The nonaudit services prohibited by the FRCs Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the Parent Company and we remain independent of the Group and the Parent Company in conducting our audit.
Our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the audit committee.

The financial statements are presented in sterling and have been prepared on a historical cost basis.
Accounting standards issued but not adopted None of the amendments to standards that are effective from 1 January 2017 had a significant effect on the Groups financial statements.
The Group has not early adopted the following new standards amendments or interpretations that have been issued but are not yet effective IFRS 9 Financial Instruments effective 1 January 2018 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers effective 1 January 2018 IFRS 16 Leases effective 1 January 2019 Annual Improvements to IFRSs 20142016 Cycle effective 1 January 2018 and 1 January 2019 IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Sharebased Payment Transactions effective 1 January 2018 The Group has commenced its assessment of the impact of these standards and IFRS 9 IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 are considered in further detail below.
The Group is not yet in a position to state whether the remaining standards would have a material impact on its results of operations and financial position.
The Group does not intend on early adopting any of these standards.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers effective for the year beginning 1 January 2018 provides a single principles based fivestep model to be applied to all sales contracts based on the transfer of control of goods and services to customers.
It replaces the separate models for goods services and construction contracts currently included in IAS 11 Construction Contracts and IAS 18 Revenue.
The most significant areas of change which could potentially have an effect are The standard prescribes that revenue is either all recognised at a point in time or is recognised over time depending on an assessment of when the performance obligation is deemed to be satisfied Recognition of variable income is subject to a revenue constraint such that revenue may only be recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of revenue recognised will not occur in future There is also a requirement to both bundle and unbundle contracts depending on how the standard guidance on performance obligations applies to the individual contractual arrangements of the Group 95 North Midland Construction PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 25748 3 April 2018 452 PM Proof 14 Notes to the Financial Statements Significant accounting policies The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the Group s financial statements in dealing with items which are considered material are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented unless otherwise stated.
The consolidated accounts include the audited financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2017.
All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.
Where the Company has control over an investment it is classified as a subsidiary.
The Company controls an investee where all three of the following elements are present power over the investee exposure to variable returns from the entity and the ability of the investor to affect those variable returns.
Control is reassessed whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there may be a change in any of these elements of control.
Notes to the financial statements continued The Groups IFRS 15 transition project is substantially complete and it is intended that the standard will be implemented with full retrospective application in the Groups 2018 financial statements.
The choice of transitional practical expedients is being finalised and will be determined during the early part of 2018.
The Directors estimate that the impact of applying IFRS 15 on the 2018 financial statements will be as below Revenue m Revenue for the year ended 31 December 2017 prior to restatement 291.8 Estimated IFRS 15 adjustment 8.1 Revenue for the year ended 31 December 2017 after restatement 299.9 Profit and total comprehensive income Profit and total comprehensive income for the year ended 31 December 2017 prior to restatement 0.7 Estimated IFRS 15 adjustment 6.5 Profit and total comprehensive income for the year ended 31 December 2017 after restatement 7.2 Retained earnings Retained earnings at 1 January 2017 prior to restatement 11.2 Estimated IFRS 15 adjustment 6.5 Retained earnings at 1 January 2017 after restatement 4.7 Profit and total comprehensive income for the year ended 31 December 2017 after restatement 7.2 Dividends payable 0.6 Retained earnings at 31 December 2017 after restatement 11.3 Based on the analysis above the Directors consider that following restatement under IFRS 15 the net assets of the Group at 31 December 2017 will not vary materially from those shown in these financial statements.
This assessment is subject to the precise choice of transitional arrangements adopted and the amounts presented in the 31 December 2018 financial statements may differ to the amounts presented above.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments effective for the year beginning 1 January 2018 replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement and specifies how an entity should classify and measure financial assets financial liabilities and some contracts to buy or sell nonfinancial items.
The most significant area of change which could potentially have an effect is the expected loss model under which an allowance for credit losses is calculated by considering the cash shortfalls that would be incurred in various default scenarios and multiplying the shortfalls by the probability of each scenario occurring.
Based on an assessment of historic credit losses on loans and receivables the Directors consider that the impact of adopting IFRS 9 will not have a material impact on the 2018 financial statements.
IFRS 16 Leases effective for the year beginning 1 January 2019 replaces IAS 17 Leases and provides a single lease accounting model requiring lessees to recognise right of use assets and lease liabilities in the Balance Sheet for all applicable leases.
Operating lease costs currently recognised within operating profit in the Statement of Comprehensive Income will be replaced by depreciation and finance costs.
IFRS 16 is expected to have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Groups financial statements as at 31 December 2019 representing an increase in gross assets and liabilities in the Balance Sheet and an increase in operating profit and finance costs in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The full impact of the standard is currently under review therefore it is not practical to provide a reasonable estimate of the financial effect until this review is complete.
96 North Midland Construction PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 25748 3 April 2018 452 PM Proof 14 Significant accounting policies continued b Property plant and equipment Property plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Land is not depreciated.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of assets less any residual value by equal instalments over their estimated lives which are considered to be
Plant and machinery between 3 and 15 years Fixtures fittings equipment and motor vehicles  between 2 and 10 years Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets.
All estimated useful economic lives and residual values are reviewed on an annual basis and adjusted if appropriate.
Gains and losses on disposal are recognised through the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes direct materials and where applicable direct labour together with a proportion of direct overheads.
Where the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of activity at the balance sheet date.
This is normally measured by the proportion that contract costs incurred for work performed to date bear to the estimated total contract costs.
Variations in contract work claims and incentive payments are included to the extent that it is probable that they will result in revenue and that they are capable of being reliably measured.
Where the income of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs incurred that it is probable will be recoverable.
Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
Where a group of contracts negotiated as a single framework are performed on a concurrent or continuous basis and are so closely interrelated that in effect they are part of a single project with a single profit margin then they accounted for as an aggregated single construction contract.
Such contracts are accounted for on a weighted basis reflecting any known inequalities in profitability and giving a more accurate reflection of the overall performance of the contract.
Where it is anticipated that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
The recoverable sales value of work carried out at the balance sheet date which has not been applied for is recognised as construction contracts in the Balance Sheet.
Trade receivables includes unpaid applications both certified and uncertified.
Applications and certificates are reduced accordingly based on the stage of completion of a contract when compared to the cash received at the balance sheet date.
The cost incurred in relation to work completed at the balance sheet date net of progress buying on construction contracts is recognised in trade payables.
In addition any payments received in advance of completing the work are also recognised in trade payables.
Legacy contracts being those entered into before 31 December 2013 and carrying a high contractual and commercial risk are also accounted for on this basis.
This is discussed further in note 4.1.
Income tax for the period is based on the taxable income for the year and is measured as the amount expected to be paid or received from the tax authorities.
Taxable income differs from profit as reported in the Statement of Comprehensive Income for the period as there are some items which may never be taxable or deductible for tax and other items which may be deductible or taxable in other periods.
Income tax for the period is calculated using the current ruling tax rate.
Deferred tax is the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities shown in the Balance Sheet.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if they arise in the following situations the initial recognition of goodwill or the initial recognition of assets and liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of recovery or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
97 North Midland Construction PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 25748 3 April 2018 452 PM Proof 14 The Group does not recognise deferred tax liabilities or deferred tax assets on temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries where the Parent Company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is not considered probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future.
It is the Groups policy to reinvest undistributed profits arising in Group companies.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
The carrying amount of the deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
The Group operates defined contribution personal pension schemes.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds.
The pension cost charge represents contributions payable by the Group to the funds.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at the fair value at the inception of the leases or if lower at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The related liability to the lessor is included in the Balance Sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between interest expenses and capital redemption of the liability.
Interest is recognised immediately in profit or loss unless attributable to qualifying assets in which case they are capitalised to the cost of those assets.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straightline basis over the lease term except if another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefit will flow to the Group.
Contingent rentals are recognised as expenses in the periods in which they are incurred.
The reinstatement provision represents the Directors best estimate of the fair value of expected costs relating to the statutory maintenance liability of two years on all contracts undertaken in the public highway.
The Group is a party to a joint arrangement when there is a contractual arrangement that confers joint control over the relevant activities of the arrangement to the Group and at least one other party.
Joint control is assessed under the same principles as control over subsidiaries.
Where the Group has both the rights to assets and obligations for the liabilities of the joint arrangement it classifies its interests as a joint operation.
In assessing the classification of interests in joint arrangements the Group considers The structure of the joint arrangement The legal form of joint arrangements structured through a separate vehicle The contractual terms of the joint arrangement agreement Any other facts and circumstances including any other contractual arrangements The Group accounts for its interests in joint operations by recognising its share of assets liabilities revenues and expenses in accordance with its contractually conferred rights and obligations.
Significant accounting policies continued Notes to the Financial Statements 98 North Midland Construction PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 25748 3 April 2018 452 PM Proof 14 j Financial instruments The Group classifies financial instruments or their component parts on initial recognition as a financial asset a financial liability or an equity instrument in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.
The Group has the following principal financial instruments Trade receivables Trade receivables are stated at their original invoiced value as the interest that would be recognised from discounting future cash receipts over the short credit period is not considered to be material.
Trade receivables are reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Interest on overdue trade receivables is recognised as it accrues.
Retentions are included in trade receivables and are stated at their original invoiced value as the interest that would be recognised from discounting future cash receipts over the short credit period is not considered to be material.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash equivalents comprise shortterm highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
An investment with a maturity of three months or less is normally classified as being short term.
Cash and cash equivalents do not include other financial assets.
Interestbearing borrowings obligations under finance leases and bank overdraft Interestbearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability.
Trade payables Trade payables are stated at their original invoiced value as the interest that would be recognised from discounting future cash payments over the short payment period is not considered to be material.
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker who is also the Chief Executive.
All financial assets excluding cash and those measured at fair value through profit and loss are assessed for indicators of impairment at each reporting date.
Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less any provision for impairment.
Business combinations under common control are accounted for using predecessor accounting whereby no assets or liabilities are restated to their fair value instead the predecessor carrying values relating to the acquired entity are used.
Revenue
Revenue represents the work done by the Group under construction contracts during the year excluding Value Added Tax.
Revenue relates solely to the Groups principal activities and all work done was carried out within the United Kingdom.
Significant accounting policies continued 99 North Midland Construction PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 25748 3 April 2018 452 PM Proof 14 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation and uncertainty 4.1 Revenue recognition and valuation of construction contracts within trade and other receivables The Group uses the percentageofcompletion method in accounting for its construction contracts.
Use of the percentageof completion method requires the Group to estimate the construction performed to date as a proportion of the total construction to be performed.
The estimation of the revenue and profit recognition by reference to the stage of completion can involve considerable judgement around future margins.
This includes the valuation of construction contract claims incentive payments and variations in the contract work.
Judgement is also applied in determining when contracts should be aggregated and treated as a single construction contract.
Where a group of contracts are treated as an aggregated single construction contract the Group has to estimate the percentage of construction to date as a proportion of the total construction to be performed in addition to estimating the future margins and any final incentive payments to be received.
The use of these estimates is intended to give the most accurate representation of the overall future single margin.
The Group reviews these estimates and assumptions as each contract progresses.
To the extent that the amounts receivable on the contracts are different to the amounts recorded such differences will impact revenue and cost of sales in the period in which such determination is made.
Change of accounting policy The Directors have restated the 2016 construction contracts and trade receivables figures to better reflect the classification of those assets in line with the Company policy and to provide reliable and more relevant information to users of the financial statements.
Trade receivables includes unpaid applications both certified and uncertified which are reduced accordingly based on the stage of completion of a contract when compared to the cash received at the balance sheet date.
Construction contract balances are amounts recoverable over and above any application values included in trade receivables.
Comparative amounts as at 31 December 2016 have been restated to reflect an increase in trade and other receivables of 7.0m in the Group and Company Balance Sheets Statements of Cash Flows and notes 16 17 and 28 with a corresponding decrease in the construction contracts balance at that date.
There has been no effect on profit or retained earnings as a result of the restatement.
Trade receivables The carrying value of trade receivables amounted to 35.23 million 2016 restated 37.70 million as at 31 December 2017 in relation to 43.69 million 2016 restated 32.84 million of applications for payment that have not been certified.
Management have significant experience in making estimates around the percentageofcompletion based on costs to complete and final project outturn.
Although there are likely to be fluctuations on individual contracts using a portfolio basis the level of estimation uncertainty leading to a material adjustment within the next financial year is considered to be low.
Estimation uncertainty which could have a material impact on the trade receivable asset has been mitigated where necessary by the use of independent quantum and legal experts who were assessed by the Directors for their ability qualifications and experience in this field.
Legacy contracts Legacy contracts are construction contracts entered into at the height of the recession before 31 December 2013 and which carried a high contractual and commercial risk.
These contracts have negatively impacted the Groups income statement in 2013 and subsequent years.
As at 31 December 2017 there is only one legacy contract remaining.
The legacy contract is included within trade receivables.
In the year to 31 December 2017 the total loss before tax recognised on legacy contracts was 7.29 million 2016 3.85 million.
During the year to 31 December 2016 the Group completed all onsite works for the one remaining legacy contract therefore removing any further uncertainty around costs to fulfil the contract.
Contract revenue on the one remaining legacy contract has been recognised based on the prudent best estimate of the Directors as at 31 December 2017 of the amount recoverable from the client.
Following a High Court ruling towards the end of 2017 which did not support the application of the wellestablished prevention principle in relation to this contract the Company has been Notes to the Financial Statements 100 North Midland Construction PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 25748 3 April 2018 452 PM Proof 14 granted leave to appeal this decision by the Court of Appeal.
On the advice of the Companys lawyers the Directors will vigorously pursue this appeal but have decided to make a further provision against the outstanding debt.
This matter will be kept under constant review and further announcements will be made if appropriate.
The Group is and will be pursuing claims with the client for sums greater than the carrying value and is in negotiations to settle this balance.
The Directors have sought to make the estimate as precise as possible by reflecting the views of independent quantum and legal experts who were appointed by the Directors for their ability qualifications and experience in this field.
The independent quantum and legal experts in conjunction with management considered a number of factors when making their assessment such as contractual terms work performed claims for variations submissions for extensions of time claims for loss and expense and expected time frames in which settlement in likely.
There are inevitably other external factors involved in the settlement of this balance which may be outside of the Boards control.
In consideration of these factors the Directors have assessed the potential reasonable range of variation on the trade receivable asset.
This range has been assessed and estimated as an increase or decrease to trade receivables of 1.80 million or 1.60 million respectively.
Whilst the Directors are making every effort to seek a swift resolution to the matter they are committed to achieving the best possible result for the Group.
The ultimate settlement of this matter may take in excess of 12 months to achieve.
Construction contracts The carrying value of construction contract assets amounted to 14.71 million 2016 restated 12.18 million as at 31 December 2017.
Construction contract assets on the Balance Sheet reflect amounts recoverable on construction contracts relating to small works frameworks manufacture and fabrication projects with low estimation uncertainty such that there is not considered to be a significant risk that their carrying amounts might change materially within the next financial year.
4.2 Deferred tax asset The carrying value of the deferred tax asset as at 31 December 2017 amounted to 1.22 million 2016 1.41 million.
The recognition of deferred tax assets primarily relates to the carry forward of unused tax losses.
This requires an assessment of the extent to which it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the unused tax losses can be utilised.
Given the recent history of tax losses of the Group the recognition of this asset requires judgement by the Directors.
The Directors have assessed the recovery of the deferred tax asset which is considered to be probable on the basis of the trading forecast for the Group indicating sufficient future taxable profits to utilise the tax losses.

Deferred tax continued 109 North Midland Construction PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 25748 3 April 2018 452 PM Proof 14 Financial instruments and financial risk management The Group is exposed through its operations to one or more of the following financial risks Interest rate risk The Group has financed its operations through a mixture of retained profits a variable rate bank overdraft and finance leases when required.
The Group manages interest rate risk in respect of surplus cash balances by making deposits with suitable financial institutions.
Given the level of net funds the Group does not consider the downside interest rate risk to be significant.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure as far as possible that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due under both normal and stressed conditions without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
Typically the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses by the use of its overdraft and finance lease contracts and availability of finance for capital projects before undertaking such projects including the servicing of financial obligations this excludes the potential impact of extreme circumstances that cannot reasonably be predicted such as natural disasters.
Forecasts and budget are approved by the Board to predict expected operational expenses each month.
The Group had cash balances at the year end of 17006000 2016 11405000 and has facilities in place to meet all anticipated working capital requirements.
Credit risk The Group extends credit to recognised creditworthy third parties.
Trade receivable balances are monitored to minimise the Groups exposure to bad debts.
Individual credit limits are set based on internal or external ratings in accordance with limits set by the Board.
Independent credit ratings are used where available to set suitable credit limits.
If there is no independent rating the Board assesses the credit quality of the customer taking into account its financial position past experience and other factors.
The utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored.
At the year end none of the trade receivable balances that were not past due or specifically provided against exceed set credit limits and management does not expect any losses from nonperformance by these counterparties.
Credit risk also arises from cash and cash equivalents deposited with financial institutions.
The Group deposits its surplus funds with only high quality banks and financial institutions with a minimum independent credit rating of A1.
Such deposits have a maturity of no more than one month.
The Directors consider that the Groups relatively diverse operations provide a reduction in concentration risk by sector geography and exposure to individual customers except the major customer as noted in note 5 where a framework agreement and long standing relationship is in place.
Loans tofrom joint operations are on normal arms length terms.
There has been no change in the Groups exposure to credit risk or how the risk is managed from the prior year.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date assuming that any security held has no value.
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.
The results of impairment testing of trade receivables is described in note 17.

NG17 2HW Notice of Meeting 116 North Midland Construction PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 25748 3 April 2018 452 PM Proof 14 Appendix to Notice of Meeting Explanatory Notes Resolution 3  ElectionReelection of Independent Directors In accordance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code all current Independent Directors at the date of the AGM will retire at the AGM.
All Directors being eligible offer themselves for election or reelection at the AGM.
Short biographical details of the Directors are shown on pages 56 and 57 of the Annual Report and Accounts and full details are available on site The Listing Rules require companies that have a controlling shareholder or shareholders to put the election or reelection of independent directors to a dual vote of i the shareholders as a whole and ii the independent shareholders being any person entitled to vote on the election of directors who is not a controlling shareholder of the Company.
Mr IB Speke Mr MS Garratt and Mrs D Hutchinson as trustees of the 1962 TG Moyle Settlement 24.38% Robert Moyle together with his wife 4.60% Mr R Moyle Mrs AEF Moyle and Mr RL Symington as trustees of the 1996 R Moyle Settlement 6.82% Mr IB Speke Mr MS Garratt and Mrs D Hutchinson as trustees of the 1967 TG Moyle Settlement 7.64% and Mr WEC Cursham and Mr PR Wood as trustees of the William Morris Settlement 8.29% are each controlling shareholders by virtue of their respective shareholdings in the Company.
The Independent Directors for these purposes are each of I Elliot SJT Brown and DP Rogers who are the Directors that the Board has determined are Independent Directors for the purposes of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Resolution 3 is therefore being proposed as an ordinary resolution which all shareholders may vote on but in addition the Company will separately count the number of votes cast by independent shareholders in favour of the resolution to determine whether the threshold in ii above has been met.
As required by the Listing Rules in respect of each of the Independent Directors the Company confirms the following i.
There are no existing or previous relationships transactions or arrangements between each Independent Director and the Company any of its Directors any controlling shareholder of the Company or any associate of such a controlling shareholder. ii.
Each of the Independent Directors continues to be effective to contribute to the performance of the Board and demonstrate commitment to his or her role.
In addition to the boardcommittee meetings and AGM they attend and contribute to executive management conferences and investor days and each of them provide additional support to the Board and the Company on a specific area of interest related to his or her skills and experience as set out on page 57. iii.
The Company has determined that each Independent Director is indeed independent by considering the various relationships referred to above and obtaining confirmation from its senior management and the relevant Independent Director that the relevant Independent Director was not involved in any decisions relating to the dealings referred to or any other dealing between the Independent Director or any organisation with which he or she is connected and the Company any of its directors any controlling shareholder of the Company or any associates of such a controlling shareholder.
The Company recommends that the Independent Directors should be reelected as set out in the relevant resolutions.
Under the Listing Rules if a resolution to reelect an independent director is not approved by a majority vote of both the shareholders as a whole and the independent shareholders of the Company at the AGM a further resolution may be put forward to be approved by the shareholders as a whole at a meeting which must be held more than 90 days after but within 120 days of the first vote.
Accordingly if any of Resolution 3 is not approved by a majority vote of the Companys independent shareholders at the AGM the relevant Directors will be treated as having been reelected only for the period from the date of the AGM until the earlier of i the close of any general meeting of the Company convened for a date more than 90 days after the AGM but within 120 days of the AGM to propose a further resolution to reelect him or her ii the date which is 120 days after the AGM and iii the date of any announcement by the Board that it does not intend to hold a second vote.
In the event that the Directors re election is approved by a majority vote of all shareholders at a second meeting the Director will then be reelected until the next
Resolution 9  Adoption of new articles of association It is proposed in resolution 9 that the Company adopts new articles of association the New Articles in order to update the Companys current articles of association the Current Articles primarily to ensure the articles are up to date with electronic communications legislation.
The principal changes introduced in the New Articles are summarised below.
Other changes which are of a minor technical or clarifying nature or conform the language of the New Articles with that used in the model articles for public companies produced by the Department for Business Innovation and Skills have not been noted below.
The New Articles are available for inspection as noted on page 116.
117 North Midland Construction PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 25748 3 April 2018 452 PM Proof 14 The Companys objects The provisions regulating the operations of the Company are currently set out in the Companys memorandum and articles of association.
The Companys memorandum contains among other things the objects clause which sets out the scope of the activities the Company is authorised to undertake.
This is drafted to give a wide scope.
The Act significantly reduces the constitutional significance of a companys memorandum and provides that a memorandum will record only the names of subscribers and the number of shares each subscriber has agreed to take in the company.
Under the Act the objects clause and all other provisions which are contained in a companys memorandum for existing companies at 1 October 2009 are deemed to be contained in the companys articles of association but the company can remove these provisions by special resolution.
Further the Act states that unless a companys articles provide otherwise a companys objects are unrestricted.
This abolishes the need for companies to have objects clauses.
For this reason the Company is proposing to remove its objects clause together with all other provisions of its memorandum which by virtue of the Act are treated as forming part of the Companys articles of association as of 1 October 2009.
Resolution 9 confirms the removal of these provisions for the Company.
As the effect of this resolution will be to remove the statement currently in the Companys memorandum of association regarding limited liability the New Articles also contain an express statement regarding the limited liability of shareholders.
Articles which duplicate statutory provisions Provisions in the Current Articles which replicate provisions contained in the Act are in the main amended to bring them into line with the Act.
Change of name Under the Companies Act 1985 a company could only change its name by special resolution.
Under the Act a company will be able to change its name by other means provided for by its articles.
To take advantage of this provision the New Articles enable the Directors to pass a resolution to change the Companys name.
Authorised share capital and unissued shares The Act abolishes the requirement for a company to have an authorised share capital and the New Articles reflect this.
Directors will still be limited as to the number of shares they can at any time allot because allotment authority continues to be required under the Act save in respect of employee share schemes.
Redeemable shares Under the Companies Act 1985 if a company wished to issue redeemable shares it had to include in its articles the terms and manner of redemption.
The Act enables directors to determine such matters instead provided they are so authorised by the articles.
The New Articles contain such an authorisation.
The Company has no plans to issue redeemable shares but if it did so the Directors would need shareholders authority to issue new shares in the usual way.
Authority to purchase own shares consolidate and subdivide shares and reduce share capital Under the Companies Act 1985 a company required specific enabling provisions in its articles to purchase its own shares to consolidate or subdivide its shares and to reduce its share capital or other undistributable reserves as well as shareholder authority to undertake the relevant action.
The Current Articles include these enabling provisions.
Under the Act a company will only require shareholder authority to do any of these things and it will no longer be necessary for articles to contain enabling provisions.
Accordingly the relevant enabling provisions have been removed in the New Articles.
Provision for employees on cessation of business The Act provides that the powers of the directors of a company to make provision for a person employed or formerly employed by the company or any of its subsidiaries in connection with the cessation or transfer to any person of the whole or part of the undertaking of the company or that subsidiary may only be exercised by the directors if they are so authorised by the companys articles or by the company in general meeting.
The New Articles provide that the Directors may exercise this power.
Appendix to Notice of Meeting Explanatory Notes 118 North Midland Construction PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 25748 3 April 2018 452 PM Proof 14 Use of seals Under the Companies Act 1985 a company required authority in its articles to have an official seal for use abroad.
Under the Act such authority will no longer be required.
Accordingly the relevant authorisation has been removed in the New Articles.
The New Articles provide an alternative option for execution of documents other than share certificates.
Under the New Articles when the seal is affixed to a document it may be signed by one authorised person in the presence of a witness whereas previously the requirement was for signature by either a director and the secretary or two directors or such other person or persons as the directors may approve.
Suspension of registration of share transfers The Current Articles permit the Directors to suspend the registration of transfers.
Under the Act share transfers must be registered as soon as practicable.
The power in the Current Articles to suspend the registration of transfers is inconsistent with this requirement.
Accordingly this power has been removed in the New Articles.
Vacation of office by directors The Current Articles specify the circumstances in which a director must vacate office.
The New Articles update these provisions to reflect the approach taken on mental and physical incapacity in the model articles for public companies produced by the Department for Business Innovation and Skills.
Electronic conduct of meetings Amendments made to the Act by the Shareholders Rights Regulations specifically provide for the holding and conducting of electronic meetings.
The Current Articles have been amended to reflect more closely the relevant provisions.
Electronic communications The New Articles have been updated to allow the Company to apply electronic communications rules to documents and information to be sent under its articles of association as well as documents and information required or permitted to be sent under the Act and under other rules or regulations including the Listing Rules.
The Act requires certain conditions to be met before a company can take advantage of the new rules including that the Company must notify shareholders by post or electronically that the relevant document is available on the website.
The New Articles allow the Company to use electronic communications with shareholders as the default position by placing any documents or information including the annual report and accounts on a website rather than sending such documents or information to shareholders in hard copy.
Shareholders may also ask for a hard copy of any document at any time.
The Company is asking each shareholder individually to agree that the Company may send or supply documents or information by means of a website subject to Resolution 9 being passed.
This request is included with this letter and explains that if the Company has not received a response within 28 days beginning with the day of the request the shareholder will be taken to have agreed.
This request is being sent to all shareholders including those who have already agreed to website publication so that in the future the Company has a single regime applicable to all shareholders.
Even if a shareholder fails to respond and is taken to agree to website publication he or she can ask for a hard copy of any document from the Company at any time.
The Company will send a notification to shareholders to alert them to the publication of the relevant document when a document or information is made available on the website.
Shareholders may choose to receive this notification in hard copy form or by email.
The new arrangements are expected to save considerable administrative printing and postage costs while preserving shareholders rights to receive hard copy documents if they wish.
General
Generally the opportunity has been taken to bring clearer language into the New Articles and in some areas to conform the language of the New Articles with that used in the model articles for public companies produced by the Department for Business Innovation and Skills.
