CHAIRMANS STATEMENT
Caroline Connellan joined Brooks Macdonald as Chief Executive in April succeeding Chris Macdonald who remains on the board in a nonexecutive capacity.
Caroline brings more than 20 years experience in the financial services industry most recently as Head of UK Premier and Wealth at HSBC.
She joins the group at an exciting point in its development.
Our discretionary funds under management grew substantially during the year surpassing the significant milestone of 10bn in April 2017 and reaching 10.5bn as at 30 June 2017 2016 8.3bn an increase of 25.9%.
This compares to a 10.5% increase in the FTSE UK Private Investor Balanced Index and represents a combination of investment performance 14.5% and continued organic growth 11.5%.
Underlying profit before tax for the year was 18.4m 2016 15.5m an increase of 18.6% on the previous year representing an underlying profit margin of 20.1% 2016 19.1%.
Underlying earnings per share also increased by 31.7% to 115.76p 2016 Statutory profit before tax for the year fell by 49.3% to 8.0m 2016 15.9m predominantly due to the decision to deal proactively with certain legacy matters arising from the former Spearpoint business as explained in the Chief Executives
We have announced the sale of Braemar Estates our property management division which will enable us to focus on our core businesses.
The board has recommended a final dividend of 26.0p 2016 23.0p which subject to approval by shareholders will result in total dividends for the year of 41.0p 2016 35.0p.
This represents an increase of 17 .1% on the previous year and reaffirms the boards confidence in the strength of the business and our commitment to a progressive dividend policy.
The final dividend will be paid on 27 October 2017 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 29 September 2017 .
Richard Spencer and Simon Wombwell are not seeking reelection to the board at this years AGM although both will continue as key members of the Group Executive Committee as Chief Investment Officer and Head of UK Distribution respectively.
This will reduce the board to nine made up of five nonexecutive directors and four executive directors a board composition in line with current corporate governance practice.
The financial services industry is going through an unprecedented period of regulatory change which will have a profound impact on businesses throughout the sector.
We recognise the demands this places on the business and consequently will be increasing investment in regulatory and risk management capabilities as outlined in the Chief Executives Review below.
This will provide a strong foundation positioning the business for future growth.
The result of the EU referendum in 2016 and the subsequent UK General Election in June 2017 have begun to impact on the UKs macroeconomic outlook and uncertainty surrounding the nature of the UKs future relationship with the EU will persist over the next eighteen months as negotiations with the EU continue.
We have already seen a fall in consumer spending.
These factors combined with the global geopolitical risks that have recently begun to weigh on market sentiment cause us to remain cautious in our external outlook.
Nevertheless the Group is wellpositioned to weather any turbulence with a strong balance sheet net cash 32.2m 2016 We are confident that the Group will continue to prosper and deliver high standards of service to our clients as well as value for our shareholders through our investment to support future growth.

CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW
Caroline Connellan Chief Executive
Having taken over as Chief Executive of Brooks Macdonald in April 2017 I am delighted to present my first report covering a year when we have continued to deliver strong underlying Group performance although statutory profit has fallen principally as a result of the previously announced provision for legacy matters .
As a result of the hard work and dedication of all our staff under Chris Macdonalds prior leadership I have joined a business that is well positioned in the market and I intend to build on this strong foundation .
Since my arrival I have had the opportunity to visit each of our offices meeting many of the advisers we partner with as well as spending time with our people listening and learning about the business firsthand .
I have been particularly impressed by our culture with its strong emphasis on client relationships and service .
This has been fundamental to our growth to date and it will remain central to our success going forward .
I would like to thank everyone at Brooks Macdonald for making me feel welcome and Chris for his support during the handover .
Discretionary fund management is our core business and we will be looking for opportunities to grow it further including enhancing our offering and service levels as well as continuing to adapt  given the fast changing external environment  to retain our strong market position .
We have already announced additional investment in our regulatory and risk management capabilities to build a stronger platform both now and for delivering sustainable growth in the future .
Pursuing greater efficiency in the business is another of my priorities in order to continue to improve our margins .
This focus on our core offering and our drive to improve margins has also led to the agreed sale of Braemar Estates our property management business expected to complete by the calendar year end .
Growth in funds under management and underlying profit A conducive market environment for risk assets continued through the year with interest rates across the developed world at highly accommodative levels and inflation subdued .
There were bouts of volatility stemming from political risk including the negotiations around Brexit and the UK US and French elections although any equity market selloff was short lived .
Bond returns were more mixed with the US Federal Reserves decision to increase US interest rates weighing on sentiment .
Within the UK equities with As we continue to invest in the Group I look forward to building on our success to date and positioning the business to deliver growth into the future.
Brooks Macdonald Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Chief Executives review
Growth in funds continued international earnings benefitted from sterling weakness whilst those with a domestic focus underperformed as real wages fell .
With heightened valuations across equity markets geopolitical risks and central banks tapering asset purchases we reduced our overweight position in equities and rebalanced client portfolios accordingly .
Within the nonequity space we have reduced our bond holdings given the uncertainty over future interest rate levels and central bank policies .
Against this backdrop the Group maintained momentum throughout the financial year achieving annual growth in our discretionary funds under management FUM of 25 .
9% to stand at 10 .5bn at 30 June 2017 2016 8 .
3bn .
Of the 2 .
2bn increase 0bn 11 .5% was net new business and 1 .
2bn 14 .5% was investment performance .
As a comparison the FTSE UK Private Investor Balanced Index increased by 10 .5% over the year .
Underlying profit before tax for the year was 18 .
4m 2016 15 .5m an increase of 18 .
6% on the previous year representing an underlying profit margin of 20 .
1% 2016 19 .
1% .
Underlying earnings per share also increased by 31 .
7% to 115 .
76p 2016 While this is a strong result for the underlying business statutory profit before tax for the year fell by 3% to 8 .
0m 2016 15 .
9m predominantly due to the provision for legacy matters detailed below as well as amortisation and an impairment to the goodwill recorded for the Levitas business although the latter is more than offset by a reduction in deferred consideration .
A full reconciliation of underlying and statutory profit can be found in the Strategic Report and segmental information on underlying and statutory profit is given in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements .
Review of business performance and development UK Investment Management continues to be our largest and most profitable segment .
We have maintained strong new business flows largely driven by our close relationships with advisers .
We remain confident in the growth opportunity and believe there continues to be significant scope to increase the breadth and depth of our adviser relationships and benefit from the continuing trend of professional intermediaries outsourcing investment management .
We continue to add value through our centralised investment process with portfolios across all risk mandates achieving abovebenchmark returns according to Asset Risk Consultants ARC private client indices over one three and five year periods .
In
November we were for the second consecutive year awarded the prestigious industry Gold Standard Award for service in discretionary fund management and we were once again proud to receive five star ratings from Defaqto for each of the main discretionary offerings our Bespoke Portfolio Service BPS direct Managed Portfolio Service MPS and our platform MPS .
We were successful at the Citywire Regional Star Awards in 2017  with professional advisers voting for our Leamington Spa and Tunbridge Wells offices as winners of their respective geographical categories .
We thank our adviser partners for their continued support .
Our UK BPS a premium and fully personalised offering to private clients charities and pension funds now represents 6 .5bn 62 .
3% of FUM and remains our principal offering .
The pension opportunity in particular SelfInvested Personal Pensions SIPPs continues to be significant as does the growth of ISAs and our AIM Portfolio Service .
We expect to be able to offer Lifetime ISAs to clients shortly .
Our UK MPS consisting of ten portfolios with distinct risk profiles and objectives is available to those investing smaller amounts and allows our investment management capabilities to be accessed by a wider range of individuals through their financial advisers .
Assets now exceed 2bn 11 .
6% of FUM held either directly with us or through a platform .
Our MPS proposition has seen rapid growth throughout the year a trend that we expect to continue as the popularity of model multiasset portfolios continues to grow .
As a Group we have maintained the focus on our Strategic Alliances which form a major part of our approach to the adviser market .
We are pleased that we have completed two further Strategic Alliances including our first international partnership with Abacus Financial Consultants based in the UAE .
In the UK we were cofounders of the DFM Alliance a joint initiative with other leading discretionary fund managers offering advisers a platform for improving client outcomes through information education and collaboration .
We have also continued to invest in our geographic footprint of offices across the UK to deliver high service levels to our local adviser partners and I am delighted to confirm that we opened a new office in Cardiff in July 2017  allowing us to access new growth opportunities in a region we have not previously been able to serve fully .
Our Funds business passed the 1bn milestone of FUM enjoying its most successful year to date and generating a profit for the first time .
It remains our intention to complete the previously announced move of the Funds business into Investment
CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW
C O NT I N U E D Brooks Macdonald Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Chief Executives review
Review of business continued Management this financial year subject to regulatory approval .
The IFSL Brooks Macdonald Defensive Capital Fund within the targeted absolute return sector celebrated an impressive seventh anniversary year with FUM reaching 393m as at 30 June 2017 2016 223m and now over 425m .
The fund received several positive ratings in 2017  including an Elite Rating by FundCalibre and Five Crowns by Financial Express FE Crown Fund Ratings based on its performance .
Our
MultiAsset Funds also saw significant growth during the year .
Earlier this year the partners of North Row Capital LLP in which the Group held a 60% stake decided to terminate the fund resulting in an impairment loss of 2m 2016 0 .
4m .
Our International business based in the Channel Islands delivered good growth with discretionary FUM increasing by 13 .
4% from 1 .
3bn to 1 .5bn over the past year and having doubled since acquisition in 2012 .
Whilst we have seen local professional intermediary relationships impacted to some extent by the legacy matters referred to below the successful restructuring of BM Retirement Services International BMRSI to a restricted financial planning business in the Channel Islands the expansion of our distribution efforts to include international advisers and our work to build business flow from South Africa have all borne fruit this past year .
We have now largely completed the move away from advisory work and our discretionary fund management offering has performed well winning the award for Best International Discretionary Fund Manager at the International Fund and Product Awards .
Together with the actions we are taking to deal proactively with the legacy matters we start the coming year in a stronger position .
Financial Planning also had a strong year driven in part by a number of oneoff pension advice opportunities generating record revenue and profits .
We continue to focus on delivering a comprehensive independent financial planning service to private clients and on seeking new opportunities to support future growth .
Sale of our Property Management business We recently completed a review of Braemar Estates and have taken the decision to sell the business enabling us to focus more closely on our core offerings .
This will allow us to operate with a more streamlined business and will contribute over time to improved margins .
We exchanged contracts on 20 September 2017 and on completion of the sale which is expected by the calendar year end the Groups property management division will cease to exist .
Investment management of the Ground Rents Income Fund will be retained by Funds .
In the financial year completed Braemar Estates represented 3 .
2% of the Groups revenue 2 .
7% of its underlying profit 126000 1 .
4% of its statutory profit 112000 and 0 .
6% of its net assets Braemar has net liabilities of 0 .5m .
The sale price is 1 .
9m with an initial 50% to be paid on completion and the remainder deferred payable over a twoyear period from the completion date .
Legacy matters arising from the former Spearpoint business As announced in July following a detailed review we decided to deal proactively with certain legacy matters arising from the former Spearpoint business which we acquired in 2012 .
These matters relate to a number of discretionary portfolios formerly managed by Spearpoint now managed by our International business and a Dublinbased fund for which Spearpoint acted as investment manager .
While we accept no legal liability we have a deep commitment to treating customers fairly and seeking to protect our clients best interests .
We believe that by taking this action it will assist us in building stronger relationships with professional intermediaries in the Channel Islands and their clients .
We are now in contact with the relevant parties .
We anticipate that this action will cost 6 .5m and have made a provision for it accordingly .
As this is an exceptional cost it is not included in our underlying profit for the year .
Investment in our infrastructure Our IT system development was delivered as planned at the end of June 2017 .
This involved the migration of data from two legacy systems in the Channel Islands on to a common platform shared with our UK portfolio management business .
As part of this process we consolidated our two back office functions into one based in the City of London to serve all clients of the Group moving forwards .
As a consequence our Guernseybased back office will close in September resulting in the redundancy of the impacted staff .
The redundancy costs were provided for in the financial year completed .
Some further post migration work remains which will complete by the calendar year end .
We are continuing to review the opportunity to align and simplify processes and take further actions to deliver economies of scale as the Group grows .
We will continue to invest further in our infrastructure to support our investment teams to enhance our service to clients and to facilitate the ease of interactions with the intermediaries we work with as well as delivering broader efficiencies .
The appointment of a Chief Operating Officer will be an important step in ensuring we can grow our business materially and sustainably whilst pursuing greater efficiency and progressively improving our margins .
Review of business 06 Brooks Macdonald Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Chief Executives review
Investing in our risk management framework The investment management industry is currently experiencing a period of significant regulatory change and the Group has been preparing for the introduction of MiFID II Senior Managers and Certification Regime SMCR and the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR amongst other changes .
Extension of the SMCR to investment firms is expected in 2018 with the Group included within the Enhanced Regime as we are now categorised as a significant investment firm for prudential purposes under FCA rules .
This categorisation has also increased the regulatory reporting requirements for the Group more broadly .
Given this context and to position the business for future growth it is important that we now invest more broadly in our regulatory and risk management capabilities .
We announced in July an increase in our capabilities including the appointment of a Chief Risk Officer to provide the support needed to our investment teams and ensure that we can continue to meet and exceed the expectations of our clients and regulators as well as the aforementioned plan to appoint a Chief Operating Officer .
This will result in a much stronger platform for delivering sustainable growth in the future .
These investments are expected to result in additional operating expenditure of approximately 4m in the next financial year of which approximately 2m will recur in subsequent years .
Outlook
As we continue to invest in the Group I look forward to building on our success to date and positioning the business to deliver growth into the future .
To achieve this our principal focus will be on delivering value for our clients and partners through enhancing the services we provide improving business efficiency and continuing to adapt to the fast changing competitive and regulatory environment .
During the financial year we have seen further consolidation across the sector given the need for investment in technology and in response to regulatory changes .
We expect this to continue as companies seek scale and cost savings .
We strongly believe in our future as an independent discretionary fund manager and will continue to look at acquisition opportunities when they arise to complement our organic growth plans .
We have started our new financial year with positive momentum and we look forward with confidence notwithstanding our relative caution around markets and client sentiment .
I would like to reiterate my thanks to everyone at Brooks Macdonald for their welcome and for their hard work and commitment to the business .

Underlying profit as a percentage of total revenue .
Total revenue Total Group revenue grew by 12 .
7% during the year compared to 4 .
8% in 2016 reflecting the strong growth in FUM within the Investment Management segment of the Group together with increased revenue in both the Financial Planning and Funds and Property Management segments as highlighted in more detail in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements .
Operating costs As in previous years the major component of the Groups operating costs is our staff comprising 54 .
6% of administrative expenses 2016 57 .
1% .
During the year we saw an increase in the average number of employees from 472 to 500 .
Of the total staff costs 30 .
8% 2016 27 .
2% were variable costs .
We have continued to invest in our IT systems across all parts of the Group to support our investment teams and to enhance the service offered to our clients .
At the end of the year we delivered our large IT project to provide a common portfolio management platform across both the UK and Channel Islands involving the migration of data from two legacy systems .
The new system will provide increased consistency and capacity across the Group and with the planned closure of our Guernseybased back office in September 2017 it will enable us to deliver further operational efficiencies .
Some additional post migration work remains to be completed over the course of the next financial year and we will continue to take additional action to align and simplify processes so that we benefit from further economies of scale .
Brooks Macdonald Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report continued Group performance continued Operating costs continued We continue to operate in an increasingly regulated environment and we have again strengthened our legal risk and compliance departments by additional recruitment over the last financial year .
In 2017  we saw the costs of the levy paid to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS stabilise at 0 .5m 2016 0 .5m .
Net financial income and gains When the Group makes an acquisition it typically structures the deal whereby there are deferred payments to the vendors over a number of years against preagreed funds under management targets .
Where these targets change due to unpredictable variables such as new business client retention and market movements then the value of the deferred consideration changes and these fair value adjustments are made through the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income .
During the year one of the original FUM targets for Levitas was not achieved resulting in a reduction in the amount payable to the vendors of the business .
Accordingly as more fully explained in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements there was a fair value reduction of 2 .
2m 2016 3 .
6m resulting in a gain to consolidated income .
As well as a reduction in the deferred consideration payable this lower level of FUM has resulted in an impairment charge of 2 .
0m to the carrying value of goodwill in respect of Levitas as detailed in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements .
As disclosed more fully in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements the partners of North Row Capital LLP in which the Group held a 60% interest decided to terminate the fund resulting in an impairment loss of 0 .
2m 2016 0 .
4m .
Included in the total net financial income and gains for the year is both the fair value reduction for Levitas and the impairment charge to goodwill together with other financial income costs and the Groups share of joint venture results as detailed on the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and the accompanying notes .
Underlying profit before tax Underlying profit before tax and underlying earnings per share are non GAAP alternative performance measures considered by the board to be a better reflection of true business performance than looking at the Groups results on a statutory basis only .
These measures are widely used by research analysts covering the Company .
Underlying results exclude expenditure falling into the categories explained below and a full reconciliation between underlying profit and the profit attributable to shareholders is provided in the following table .
Table 2 Reconciliation of underlying profit before tax to statutory profit before tax Underlying profit before tax 18.4 15 .5 Amortisation of intangible assets 3.9 Finance cost of deferred consideration 0.2 Changes in fair value of deferred consideration 2.2 3 .6 Impairment of carrying value of goodwill 2.0 Exceptional costs of resolving legacy matters 6.5 Statutory profit before tax 8.0 15 .9 Amortisation of intangible assets note 13 As explained in notes 2d and 2m client relationship intangible assets and contracts acquired with fund managers are created in the course of acquiring funds under management .
The total amortisation charge for the year of 3 .
9m 2016 2 .
6m associated with these and other intangible assets has been excluded from underlying profit as the directors consider these costs can distort the results of a particular period .
During the year the Group completed a large software project in order to provide a more fully integrated investment management system covering both the onshore and offshore businesses with an improved client portal and client relationship management system .
This resulted in an increase in the software amortisation charge of 1 .
2m as part of the overall increase in amortisation of intangible assets for the year of 1 .
3m .
Group performance 10 Brooks Macdonald Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report continued Group performance continued Finance cost and changes in fair value of deferred consideration When the Group makes acquisitions of both corporate entities and teams of fund managers in the course of acquiring funds under management the typical structure of the acquisition in order to continue to incentivise and motivate the vendors is to make deferred payments over a period of time based on the retention and growth in funds under management .
The initial estimated fair value of the deferred payments will be based on future projections of funds under management and where the actual payment is different from the original estimates then charges or credits will be made in arriving at the profit before tax .
The directors consider that the effect of these changes to the original projected payments can distort the results of a particular period and have therefore excluded them from underlying profit .
Initial estimates of the deferred cash payments are recognised in the financial statements at their present value based on an inherent rate of implied interest .
The difference between the discounted present value of deferred consideration and the estimated future cash payment is recognised as a charge over the duration of the deferral period in arriving at profit before tax .
The directors consider that this charge which is a noncash item can distort the results of a particular period and have therefore excluded the charge from underlying profit .
Impairment in carrying value of goodwill As explained in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment based on the carrying value of the asset compared to its expected recoverable amount .
As a result of a lower level of FUM in Levitas resulting in reduction in the deferred consideration as detailed above there has been an impairment to the carrying value of 0m due to a reduction in the estimated valueinuse of the business .
The directors consider that this charge which is a noncash item can distort the results of a particular period and have therefore excluded the charge from underlying profit .
Exceptional costs of resolving legacy matters As detailed in note 24 to the consolidated financial statements we have decided to deal with two legacy matters arising from the former Spearpoint business in the Channel Islands which we acquired in 2012 .
These matters relate to the investment management of a number of discretionary client portfolios and a Dublinbased fund and we have decided to make a provision of 6 .5m in order to resolve them .
The board consider that this is an exceptional item relating to historic matters and its impact on statutory profit does not give a true reflection of the underlying performance of the Group .
Cash resources and regulatory capital The Group is cash generative and as detailed in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows there was an increase in cash resources at the year end of 12 .
7m to 32 .
2m 2016 19 .5m .
The Group had no borrowings at 30 June 2017 2016 nil .
As required under Financial Conduct Authority FCA rules and those of both Jersey and Guernsey Financial Services Commissions we perform a regular Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP and Adjusted Net Liquid Asset ANLA calculation which includes performing a range of stress tests to determine the appropriate level of regulatory capital and liquidity that the Group needs to hold .
Surplus levels of capital are forecast taking into account investment requirements and proposed dividends to ensure that appropriate buffers are maintained .
The Groups Pillar 3 disclosures are published annually on our website www . brooksmacdonald . com .
Segmental review The Group reports its results in four key operating segments Investment Management Financial Planning Funds and Property Management and International .
Investment management The UK based investment management service continues to remain the core part of the Group contributing 71 .
7% 2016 72 .
1% of the Group revenue .
Investment Management principally provides discretionary investment management to private investors pension funds charities and trusts through BPS and MPS .
Despite considerable changes within the industry and volatility within the financial markets we have continued to grow FUM as shown in the table on page 8 .
Group performance Brooks Macdonald Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report continued Group performance continued Segmental review continued Financial planning The Financial Planning business continues to deliver both fee based financial advice to high networth families and employee benefit consultancy to small and medium sized employers throughout the UK .
The division remains a major introducer of new investment management funds to the investment management part of the Group and it was the growth in this area which was the major contributor to the 19% increase in revenue and the profit for the year of 0 .
3m compared to the previous years loss of 0 .
1m .
Funds and property management The funds business continues to grow in scale with total FUM increased by 45 .
6% to 1159m 2016 796m at 30 June 2017 .
This growth was achieved organically through net new investment across the range of funds with the Defensive Capital Fund now over 400m FUM .
The Property Management business had another improved year with an increase in revenue of 16 .
4% over the previous year and reported a profit for the year compared to breakeven in 2016 .
International
The business saw an increase of FUM during the year of 13 .
4% to 1 .5bn 2016 1 .
3bn with new business from a number of sources and the first strategic alliance with an overseas introducer in Dubai together with increased flows from South Africa .
Revenue in the year increased by 8 .
4% although increased legal costs continuing to deal with some legacy matters and the closure costs of 0 .
3m associated with the transfer of the operations department from Guernsey to London have resulted in a fall in underlying profit to 0 .5m 2016 0 .
8m .
Following the results of a review we have decided to deal proactively with certain legacy matters where the former Spearpoint business acted as investment manager to a number of discretionary clients and to a Dublin based fund .
As well as these issues consuming management time the Group was incurring associated costs so in order to treat our clients fairly and to protect their best interests we have made a provision during the year of 6 .5m in order to resolve these matters resulting in a statutory loss before tax for the year of 6 .
6m 2016 0 .
4m profit .
Since the acquisition of the Channel Islands business discretionary FUM have grown from 0 .
6bn to over 1 .5bn at 30 June 2017 and following the satisfactory resolution of the former Spearpoint matters the board believes that the business will see an increase in profit in the next financial year .
Group and consolidation adjustments The costs charged through this segment represent the costs of running the Groups parent company including the costs of the board members the costs of running the plc and other central costs which are not directly related to the trading segments of the Group .

Company Share Option Plan CSOP Following discussions regarding remuneration structures and incentives schemes for senior employees and directors the Company decided to set up a CSOP which was approved by shareholders at the annual general meeting on 17 October 2013 and by HMRC on 21 November 2013 .

Nonexecutive directors Nonexecutive directors have a letter of appointment rather than contracts of employment .
The executive directors are responsible for determining the fees of the nonexecutive directors who do not receive pension or other benefits from the Group and do not participate in any Group incentive schemes .
Corporate governance Corporate governance Brooks Macdonald Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report continued Corporate governance continued Remuneration Committee continued Plans for 201718 The committee has reviewed the remuneration policy in relation to senior executive directors including those on the Group board during the year and have sought external advice from New Bridge Street a part of AON .
In particular consideration was given to how well the existing policy was linked with strategy the alignment of management interests with those of shareholders and quanta .
The committee consulted with major shareholders on a new remuneration structure and policy for these senior executive directors .
This review and consultation occurred at a time when there were considerable developments in the debate amongst shareholders and their representatives government and advisory bodies .
As a result of feedback and in recognition of the ongoing industry debate the committee resolved to introduce changes to the annual bonus arrangements with effect for the 201718 financial year and during the course of that year to review further the arrangements for an equity based longterm incentive scheme to replace the current Long Term Incentive Scheme .
The overriding objectives remain for the policy to be linked to the Groups strategy aligned with shareholders interests with significant long term equity participation with both annual and long term elements and to be compliant with the relevant FCA regulations and other guidance .
The scheme will be aligned with the boards appetite for risk and aims to be fair for both employee and Company with due regard to market competitiveness whilst retaining some element of discretion .
The changes agreed by the committee in relation to the annual bonus for senior executive directors are The existing uncapped profitsharing arrangement is replaced with a bonus structure under which participants have a defined maximum opportunity set as a percentage of salary which will not exceed 150% of salary for any executive .
The bonus will be based on the following three measures in 201 7 18 Underlying profit before tax 40% Net organic growth in funds under management 20% and Personalstrategic objectives 40% .
It is expected that the personalstrategic weighting is reduced in future years but for 201 7 18 a higher weighting is appropriate as the new CEO undertakes a thorough review of the business and its strategy begins to implement it and as the Group prepares for the challenges resulting from MiFID II .
The actual targets and objectives are commercially sensitive and therefore will not be disclosed in advance however the committee will seek to report the targets in next years report and provide commentary on how any bonus was arrived at .
For financial metrics a sliding scale of targets will be set around the budget for the year and account will be taken of market consensus .
One third of any bonus earned will be deferred in shares for 2 years .
Robust malus and clawback provisions will apply to any bonus earned including the deferred element .
The committee has also considered the obligations of the Group under CRD IV to comply with the Remuneration Code under the FCA SYSC 19A Handbook .
In accordance with the FCAs guidance the Group has disapplied certain remuneration provisions relating to variable pay on the grounds of proportionality .
These are the provisions known as the payout process rules .

Brooks Macdonald Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report continued Risk and Compliance Committee continued Nonfinancial risks The significant nonfinancial risks faced by the Group have been reviewed by the committee which believes they remain broadly the same as in previous years and are as follows Reputational risk
The Group has a growing reputation as a provider of high quality investment and wealth management services .
There is a risk that significant damage to reputation could lead to the loss of existing clients as well as impacting on the ability to attract new clients which would lead to a fall in financial income .
Such risk could arise from events such as poor investment performance poor client service or regulatory censure .
Mitigation
This risk is minimised by ensuring the Group maintains a culture of high ethical and professional standards whilst focussing on delivering a first class service to all of our clients and intermediaries .
The Group maintains separate independent risk and compliance departments which ensures conformity with the regulations of its key regulators as well as relevant statutes in all of our dealings with our clients .
Regulatory risk
The sector in which the Group operates is heavily regulated and any breach of regulations could lead to fines or disciplinary action against the Group or its staff .
Through the business activities of its subsidiaries the Group is exposed to regulatory risks including those associated with the provision of investment and financial advice the holding and custody of client money and assets the suitability of its investment portfolios and financial crime .
Mitigation
The Group monitors compliance with existing law and regulations and keeps abreast of future changes to assess the likely business impact and to ensure that the Group has sufficient resources to implement any necessary changes .
The Group continued to invest in its Risk and Compliance functions during the year and is committed to further adding to the capabilities of these functions in order to meet the challenges posed by future regulatory changes such as MIFID II GDPR etc .
People risk
Our business is dependent on client relationships with our staff .
Operating in a competitive market there is a risk of loss of existing clients due to poor performance or service a failure to respond to changes in the market place or the loss of key investment professionals .
The retention of staff who are not investment professionals e . g . central functions is also a risk for the organisation .
Mitigation
To minimise this risk the Group continues to invest in its employees and monitors developments in the marketplace in which it operates to ensure that the Group continues to offer a wide range of services .
Recruitment policies are designed to attract high quality staff and the Group regularly reviews and validates its remuneration packages and contractual arrangements and motivation is measured through a sentiment index .
Structured training is provided by the Groups learning and development team .
Cyber and data security risk
The Group holds approximately 40000 client records in its systems containing personal data and financial data related to the Groups clients .
The Group represents a target for hackers and is at significant risk of attack .
Mitigation
The Groups systems employ firewalls and other technological security features to prevent unauthorised access .
User identification and password details are required in order to access the Groups network and systems .
Individual user access is restricted to specific areas of the network relevant to the users job role .
As such any access would be likely to be limited to specific areas of the network .
Regular technological security checks are undertaken to validate the access rights of existing users .
The IT system is duplicated in two remote data centres and data is carried over dark fibre connections .
Data records are updated to provide a recovery point objective of one hour and a recovery time objective of one hour .
Brooks Macdonald Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report continued Risk and Compliance Committee continued Nonfinancial risks continued Outsourcing risk
Where key systems are provided by outsourced providers there is a risk of failure of the outsourcing partners or external suppliers .
There are further risks in the onboarding of outsourcing partners and ongoing support from them .
The Groups most significant outsourcing risk relates to its IT network infrastructure which is provided by an outsourced service provider .
Mitigation
Due diligence takes place prior to the commencement of any outsourcing or supplier relationship to maintain a robust procurement process and good contract governance .
We keep our key outsourcing partners under review and have in place procedures to regularly assess the performance of such suppliers as well as identifying suitable and viable alternatives .
The Company has required that its outsourced IT services provider agrees contracts with thirdparty services providers that would allow for contracts to be novated immediately to Brooks Macdonald in the event of a business failure of the outsourced service provider .
Operational risk
There is a risk that the Group suffers a loss of business resulting from inadequate systems or controls failed internal processes or human error .
Mitigation
The Groups riskmanagement framework comprises ongoing monitoring the application of detective and preventative controls and reporting of operational incidents by both the first and second line teams .
The risk function works with businesses to conduct risk and control assessments and external auditors and third party consultancies provide further ad hoc assurance .
Portfolio mandate risk
There is a risk that the Group breaches its investment mandates agreed limits investment objectives or client specified restrictions and benchmarks for its discretionary investment management clients .
Mitigation
The Group uses a centralised investment proposition though which asset allocation is determined for a range of risk profiles .
Investment managers have some flexibility within the asset allocation model but are monitored to ensure individual portfolios do not fall outside the broad asset allocation model .
Portfolios are also monitored by a dedicated team using specialist portfolio risk management tools to ensure individual portfolios do not fall outside the permitted asset allocation model .

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF BROOKS MACDONALD GROUP PLC C O NT I N U E D The scope of our audit As part of designing our audit we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements .
In particular we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain .
As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud .
Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that in the auditors professional judgement were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement whether or not due to fraud identified by the auditors including those which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team .
These matters and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters .
This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit .
Report on the audit of the financial statements continued 32 Brooks Macdonald Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Independent auditors report to the members of Brooks Macdonald Group plc  continued Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter Valuation of Levitas goodwill and related deferred consideration Refer to note 2 Principal accounting policies note 13 Intangible assets and note 21 Deferred consideration.
The valuation of the Levitas Investment Management Limited Levitas cash generating unit requires management to make a number of significant judgements which may materially affect the valuation such as forecasted funds under management FUM and related cashflows discount and growth rates in order to calculate the value in use .
Forecasted FUM also drives managements fair valuation of deferred consideration payable initially recognised at the time of acquisition .
The Levitas goodwill represents 9 .
3m of the groups intangible assets after recognising a 2 .
0m impairment loss during the year .
The deferred consideration at the balance sheet date was 3 .
4m with a gain of 2 .
2m recognised during the year in relation to the decrease in fair value .
The size of the balances and the significant degree of judgement involved in the groups valuations makes this a key audit matter .
We obtained managements impairment review of the Levitas goodwill and performed the following We evaluated managements valuation methodology against the requirements in IAS 36 Impairment of assets .
We obtained the 5year forecasted FUM and related revenues and expenses that were board approved and challenged the drivers of the forecasted FUM and considered the accuracy of managements forecasting process with reference to historic results .
We tested and challenged the reasonableness of key assumptions including the discount rate and long term growth rates using available market information .
We tested managements sensitivity analysis to determine the impact of changes in the key assumptions .
We evaluated the appropriateness of the impairment disclosures included in the group financial statements .
We performed the following procedures over managements deferred consideration fair valuation We agreed the basis of the calculation to the contractual terms and evaluated managements valuation methodology against the requirements in IFRS 13 Fair value .
We tested the mathematical accuracy of managements calculation agreed the FUM at the 201 7 contractual measurement date to the external administrator statement and agreed cash payments during the year to bank statements .
We agreed forecasted FUM up to the final contractual measurement date November 2018 to managements forecasted FUM which we tested as part the goodwill impairment testing .
We reviewed the disclosures made in the financial statements to determine their adequacy .
Based on the work performed above managements impairment review and deferred consideration valuation approaches are reasonable .
Brooks Macdonald Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Independent auditors report to the members of Brooks Macdonald Group plc  continued Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter Completeness of the provision for legacy matters Refer to note 2 Principal accounting policies and note 24
The group recognised a provision of 6 .5m in relation to legacy matters in the International business .
The size of the provision makes this a key audit matter .
Management is required to make estimates in respect of the completeness of the provision in accordance with IAS 37 provisions contingent liabilities and contingent assets .
We performed the following procedures in relation to the completeness of the provision for legacy matters We understood the nature of the legacy matters and assessed managements accounting treatment in line with the IAS 37 conditions to recognise a provision .
We understood from management and board members the rationale for estimating the amount of provision to be recognised .
We evaluated the methodology used and the supporting evidence to calculate the provision .
We read correspondence with legal advisors consultants and regulators as well as the groups press releases for any matters which we were not previously made aware of and which could indicate that the provision may not be complete .
We reviewed the disclosures made in the financial statements to determine their adequacy .
On the basis of the procedures performed the provision recognised appears reasonable .
Recognition of investment management fee income Refer to note 2 Principal accounting policies and note 4
Investment management fee income is generated by the Brooks Macdonald Asset Management Limited BMAM and Brooks Macdonald Asset Management International Limited BMI entities and is included within portfolio management fee income in the notes to the financial statements .
The investment management fee income component represents 57% of the groups 91 .
7m total revenue .
This is a key audit matter due to its size and the significant audit effort involved in testing this revenue stream .
The fees are calculated by applying each clients fee rate to their FUM .
The calculation is largely automated however there are a number of inherent risks including the interpretation and manual input of key contractual terms and the completeness and valuation of funds under management which could result in errors .
We performed the following procedures in relation to investment management fee income We understood and evaluated the design and implementation of key controls including relevant Information Technology IT controls in place around the investment management fee process .
We tested IT general controls over the BMAM portfolio management system and relevant automated controls over the mathematical accuracy of the investment management fee calculation and the pricing data feed used to value FUM .
For BMI we tested the accuracy of fees by recalculating the fee for a sample of clients .
For both BMAM and BMI We agreed for a sample fee rates input into the systems to client contracts .
We tested a sample of managements FUM reconciliations to external custodians .
We tested the valuation of a sample of assets against independent market prices .
We reconciled the fees calculated by the portfolio management systems to the general ledger postings and investigated material differences .
Our testing did not identify any evidence of material misstatement .
Brooks Macdonald Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Independent auditors report to the members of Brooks Macdonald Group plc  continued We determined that there were no key audit matters applicable to the company to communicate in our report .
How we tailored the audit scope We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole taking into account the geographic structure of the group the accounting processes and controls and the industry in which the group operates .
The group is composed of the company incorporated in the UK and subsidiary entities in the UK and Channel Islands .
The groups accounting process is structured around a centralised finance function in the UK .
In establishing the overall approach to the audit of the group we considered our assessment of the risk of material misstatement .
We determined that three entities Brooks Macdonald group plc Brooks Macdonald Asset Management Limited and Brooks Macdonald Asset Management International Limited generated significant activities or balances to the results of the group through the consideration of various factors such as their contribution to the groups profit before tax and to provide sufficient evidence over each line item in the groups financial statements .
We supplemented this with additional testing over certain balances such as cash property plant and equipment and trade and other receivables and payables which were recognised within entities not fully in scope of the group audit .
Taken together our audit work accounted for more than 84% of group revenues and 97% of group profit before tax and 81% of group total assets .
We determined the audit work that needed to be performed by us as the group engagement team or by local PwC network firms .
Where the work was performed by a local audit team we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the group financial statements as a whole .
In connection with this years audit the group team met with the local Channel Islands audit team leader and held regular discussions with the team throughout the audit process .
The group consolidation financial statement disclosures and a number of group items including valuation of goodwill and intangibles share based payments expense recharges and the provision for resolving legacy matters were audited by the group engagement team .
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality .
We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality .
These together with qualitative considerations helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole .
Based on our professional judgement we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows Group financial statements Company financial statements Overall materiality 727000 2016 778000 .
502000 2016 432000 .
How we determined it 5% of profit before tax adjusted for the provision for resolving legacy matters .
1% of net assets .
Rationale for benchmark applied We have adjusted profit before tax for the provision for resolving legacy matters of 6 .5m which we consider to be an exceptional and nonrecurring item .
Due to its size this item distorts the basis of the calculation .
1% of net assets is a commonly used industry benchmark for holding entities such as the company .
For each component in the scope of our group audit we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality .
Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall group materiality .
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above 36000 group audit 2016 39000 and 25000 company audit 2016 22000 as well as misstatements below those amounts that in our view warranted reporting for qualitative reasons .
Brooks Macdonald Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Independent auditors report to the members of Brooks Macdonald Group plc  continued Conclusions relating to going concern We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which ISAs UK require us to report to you when the directors use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate or the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the groups and companys ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue .
However because not all future events or conditions can be predicted this statement is not a guarantee as to the groups and companys ability to continue as a going concern .
Reporting on other information The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors report thereon .
The directors are responsible for the other information .
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and accordingly we do not express an audit opinion or except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report any form of assurance thereon .
In connection with our audit of the financial statements our responsibility is to read the other information and in doing so consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated .
If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information .
If based on the work we have performed we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information we are required to report that fact .
We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities .
With respect to the Strategic Report and Report of the Directors we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included .
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit ISAs UK require us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below .
Strategic Report and Report of the Directors In our opinion based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit the information given in the Strategic Report and Report of the Directors for the year ended 30 June 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements .
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Report of the Directors .
Brooks Macdonald Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Independent auditors report to the members of Brooks Macdonald Group plc  continued Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors Responsibilities set out on page 27  the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view .
The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error .
In preparing the financial statements the directors are responsible for assessing the groups and the companys ability to continue as a going concern disclosing as applicable matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the company or to cease operations or have no realistic alternative but to do so .
Auditors responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditors report that includes our opinion .
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs UK will always detect a material misstatement when it exists .
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if individually or in the aggregate they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements .
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRCs website at www . rc . org . ukauditorsresponsibilities .
This description forms part of our auditors report .
Use of this report This report including the opinions has been prepared for and only for the companys members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose .
We do not in giving these opinions accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing .
Other required reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if in our opinion we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit or adequate accounting records have not been kept by the company or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us or certain disclosures of directors remuneration specified by law are not made or the company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns .
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility .

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOW FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2017 Brooks Macdonald Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2017 General information Brooks Macdonald Group plc the Company is the parent company of a group of companies the Group which offers a range of investment management services and related professional advice to private high net worth individuals charities and trusts .
The Group also provides financial planning as well as offshore fund management and administration services and acts as fund manager to regulated OEICs providing specialist funds in the property and structured return sectors and managing property assets on behalf of these funds and other clients .
The Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006 and listed on AIM .
The address of its registered office is 72 Welbeck Street London W1G 0AY .
Principal accounting policies The general accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below .
These policies have been applied consistently to all years presented unless otherwise stated .
The Groups consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRS IC interpretations as adopted by the European Union and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS .
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the revaluation of available for sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss such that they are measured at their fair value .
At the time of approving the financial statements the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future .
Accordingly they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements .
The Groups financial statements are a consolidation of the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries .
The underlying financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the Company using consistent accounting policies .
Subsidiaries and structured entities are all entities controlled by the Company deemed to exist where the Company is exposed to or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity .
The financial statements of the subsidiaries are included from the date on which control is transferred to the Group to the date that control ceases .
All intercompany transactions and balances between group companies are eliminated on consolidation .
The Group has disclosed all of its subsidiary undertakings in note 41 of the parent companys financial statements .
The Groups accounting policies that have been applied in preparing these financial statements are consistent with those disclosed in the Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2016 except as explained below .
New accounting standards amendments and interpretations adopted in the period In the year ended 30 June 2017  the Group did not adopt any new standards or amendments issued by the IASB or interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRS IC that have had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements .

They may however impact the accounting for future transactions and arrangements .

IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 could change how and when revenue is recognised .
The primary impact is expected to be around the recognition of performance fees .
Under IFRS 15 the Group will be required to make an assessment as to whether the work performed to earn such fees constitutes the transfer of services and therefore fulfils any performance obligations .
If so these fees can be recognised when charged if not the fees can only be recognised in the period the services are provided .
The Group currently recognises these when the probability of meeting the performance criteria is virtually certain .
Some client agreements may need to be amended to ensure that any performance criteria are fully documented but based upon a preliminary assessment the Group does not expect a material change to the recognition of its revenue arising from these revenue streams .
The Group is still in the process of making an impact assessment and as yet any further impact has not been quantified .
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2017 C O NT I N U E D Brooks Macdonald Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2017  continued Principal accounting policies continued c Changes in accounting policies continued IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9 changes the classification and measurement of financial assets .
Financial assets will be classified into one of three categories amortised cost fair value through profit or loss FVTPL or fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI .
The held to maturity loans and receivables and available for sale categories available under IAS 39 have been removed .
In addition the classification criteria for allocating financial assets between categories are different under IFRS 9 .
There is no material change to the classification of financial liabilities .
The Group does not expect the new classification bases to have a material impact on its financial assets .
Those currently carried at amortised cost including cash and cash equivalents trade and other receivables will continue to be classified as such .
Some of the Groups available for sale assets may be reclassified as FVTPL under IFRS 9 where the Group does not collect all contractual cash flows .
Other available for sale assets comprise preference share holdings and these will likely be classified as FVOCI as the Groups intention is to collect all contractual cash flows being solely payments of principal and interest .
IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 will require the recognition of a rightofuse asset and associated lease liability for the office premises that are leased by the Group .
The asset would be depreciated over the lease term and the liability would accrue interest resulting in a frontloaded expense profile .
This accounting treatment contrasts with the current treatment for operating leases where no asset or liability is recognised and the lease payments are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis over the term of the lease .
The total cost of the lease over the lease term is expected to be unchanged under the new standard .
The preparation of financial information requires the use of assumptions estimates and judgements about future conditions .
Use of currently available information and application of judgement are inherent in the formation of estimates .
Actual results in the future may differ from those reported .
In this regard the directors believe that the accounting policies where judgement is necessarily applied are those that relate to the measurement of intangible assets deferred consideration the estimation of the fair value of sharebased payments and client compensation provisions .
The underlying assumptions made are reviewed on an ongoing basis .
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised only if the revision affects both current and future periods .
Further information about key assumptions and sources of estimation uncertainty are set out below .
Intangible assets The Group has acquired client relationships and the associated investment management contracts as part of business combinations through separate purchase or with newly employed teams of fund managers as described in note 13 .
In assessing the fair value of these assets the Group has estimated their finite life based on information about the typical length of existing client relationships .
Contracts acquired with fund managers and acquired client relationship contracts are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from 5 to 20 years .
Goodwill recognised as part of a business combination is reviewed annually for impairment or when a change in circumstances indicates that it might be impaired .
The recoverable amounts of cash generating units are determined by value in use calculations which require the use of estimates to derive the projected future cash flows attributable to each unit .
Details of the more significant assumptions are given in note 13 .
Deferred consideration As described in note 21 the Group has a deferred consideration balance in respect of the acquisition of Levitas Investment Management Services Limited in July 2014 .
Deferred consideration is recognised at its fair value being an estimate of the amount that will ultimately be payable in future periods .
This has been calculated allowing for estimated growth in the acquired funds discounted by the estimated cost of capital .
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2017 C O NT I N U E D 44 Brooks Macdonald Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2017  continued Principal accounting policies continued d Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued Sharebased payments The Group operates various sharebased payment schemes in respect of services received from certain employees .
Estimating the fair value of these sharebased payments requires the Group to apply an appropriate valuation model and determine the inputs to that model note 28 .
The charge to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in respect of sharebased payments is calculated using assumptions about the number of eligible employees that will leave the Group and the number of employees that will satisfy the relevant performance conditions .
These estimates are reviewed regularly .
Provisions
The Group may receive complaints from clients in relation to the services provided .
Complaints are assessed on a casebycase basis and provisions are made where it is judged to be likely that compensation will be paid .
The accounting policy for provisions and contingent liabilities is outlined in note 2p .
Exceptional items are disclosed and described separately in the financial statements where it is necessary to do so to provide further understanding of the underlying financial performance of the Group .
These include material items of income or expense that are shown separately due to the significance of their nature and amount .
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method .
The cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the aggregate amount of the consideration transferred at the acquisition date irrespective of the extent of any minority interest .
Acquisition costs are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year of acquisition .
When the Group acquires a business it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms economic circumstances and pertinent conditions at the acquisition date .
If the business combination is achieved in stages the fair value of the Groups previously held equity interest is remeasured at the acquisition date and the difference is credited or charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income .
Identifiable assets and liabilities assumed on acquisition are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at their fair value at the date of acquisition .
Any contingent consideration to be paid by the Group to the vendor is recognised at its fair value at the acquisition date .
Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are recognised in accordance with IAS 39 in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income .
Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the consideration transferred over the acquired companys net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed .
If the consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets acquired the difference is recognised as a gain on a bargain purchase in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income .
Impairment
Goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite life are tested annually for impairment .
For the purposes of impairment testing goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Groups cash generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquisition are assigned to those units .
The carrying amount of each cash generating unit is compared to its recoverable amount which is determined using a discounted future cash flow model .
Where goodwill forms part of a cashgenerating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation .
Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash generating unit retained .
Brooks Macdonald Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2017  continued g Fees commissions and interest Portfolio management fees and financial services commission Portfolio management and other advisory and custody services are billed in arrears but are recognised over the period the service is provided .
Fees are calculated on the basis of a percentage of the value of the portfolio over the period .
Dealing charges are levied at the time a deal is placed for a client .
Fees are only recognised when the fee amount can be estimated reliably and it is probable that the fee will be receivable .
Amounts are shown net of rebates paid to significant investors .
Performance fees are earned from some clients when contractually agreed performance levels are exceeded within specified performance measurement periods .
They are only recognised at the end of these performance periods when a reliable estimate of the fee can be made and it virtually certain that it will be received .
Advisory fees Advisory fees are charged to clients using an hourly rate or by a fixed fee arrangement and are recognised over the period the service is provided .
Commissions receivable and payable are accounted for in the period in which they are earned .
Fund management fees Where amounts due are conditional on the successful completion of fund raising for investment vehicles revenue is recognised where in the opinion of the directors there is reasonable certainty that sufficient funds have been raised to enable the successful operation of that investment vehicle .
Amounts due on an annual basis for the management of third party investment vehicles are recognised on a time apportioned basis .
Property management fees Property management fees are charged using a fixed fee agreement .
Fees are recognised over the contractual period .
Interest
Interest receivable is recognised on an accruals basis .
Cash comprises cash in hand and call deposits held with banks .
Cash equivalents comprise shortterm highly liquid investments with a maturity of less than three months from the date of acquisition .
Equitysettled schemes The Group engages in equitysettled sharebased payment transactions in respect of services received from certain employees .
The fair value of the services received is measured by reference to the fair value of the shares or share options on the grant date .
This cost is then recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income over the vesting period with a corresponding credit to equity .
The fair value of the options granted is determined using option pricing models which take into account the exercise price of the option the current share price the risk free rate of interest the expected volatility of the Companys share price over the life of the award and other relevant factors .
The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that is provided internally to the Group board of directors which is the Groups chief operating decision maker .
The Group commonly acts as trustee and in other fiduciary capacities that result in the holding or placing of assets on behalf of individuals trusts retirement benefit plans and other institutions .
These assets and income arising thereon are excluded from these financial statements as they are not assets of the Group .
The Group holds money on behalf of some clients in accordance with the client money rules of the Financial Conduct Authority .
Such monies and the corresponding liability to clients are not included within the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as the Group is not beneficially entitled thereto .
Principal accounting policies continued 46 Brooks Macdonald Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2017  continued Principal accounting policies continued l Property plant and equipment All property plant and equipment is included in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment .
Costs include the original purchase cost of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset into a working condition for its intended use .
Provision is made for depreciation to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset using a straight line method over its expected useful life as follows Fixtures and fittings 3 to 6 .
67 years Equipment 5 years Leasehold improvements over the term of the lease Motor vehicles 4 years The assets residual values and useful economic lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at the end of each reporting period .
Gains and losses arising on disposal are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount .
These are included in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income .
Amortisation of intangible assets is charged to administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 4 to 20 years .
Acquired client relationship contracts and contracts acquired with fund managers Intangible assets are recognised where client relationship contracts are either separately acquired or acquired with investment managers who are employed by the Group .
These are initially recognised at cost and are subsequently amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful economic life .
Separately acquired client relationship contracts are amortised over 15 to 20 years and those acquired with investment managers over 5 years .
Both types of intangible asset are reviewed annually to determine whether there exists an indicator of impairment or an indicator that the assumed useful economic life has changed .
Computer software Costs incurred on internally developed computer software are initially recognised at cost and when the software is available for use the costs are amortised on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life of four years .
Initial research costs and planning prior to a decision to proceed with development of software are recognised in the statement of profit and loss when incurred .
Goodwill
Goodwill arising as part of a business combination is initially measured at cost being the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the separately identifiable assets liabilities and contingent liabilities of the subsidiary at date of acquisition .
In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed annually for impairment and is therefore stated at cost less any provision for impairment of value .
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and is not subsequently reversed .
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold .
On acquisition any goodwill acquired is allocated to cash generating units for the purposes of impairment testing .
If the cost of the acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired the difference is recognised directly in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income .
A joint venture is an entity in which the Group holds a longterm interest and is jointly controlled by the Group and one or more third parties under a contractual agreement .
Under the equity method of accounting interests in joint ventures are initially recognised at cost in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the entities .
The Groups share of the results of joint ventures is included in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income .
Brooks Macdonald Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2017  continued If the Groups share of the losses of a joint venture equals or exceeds its investment the Group does not recognise further losses unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture .
The Group classifies financial assets in the following categories fair value through profit or loss available for sale loans and receivables and heldtomaturity .
The classification is determined by management on initial recognition of the financial asset which depends on the purpose for which it was acquired .
Fair value through profit or loss Financial instruments are classified as fair value through profit or loss if they are either held for trading or specifically designated in this category on initial recognition .
Assets in this category are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured with gains or losses arising from changes in fair value being recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income .
Available for sale Available for sale financial assets are nonderivatives that are either specifically designated in this category or are not classified in any of the other categories .
They are included in noncurrent assets unless the investment matures or management intends to dispose of it within 12 months of the end of the reporting period .
Available for sale financial assets are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently revalued based on the current bid prices of the assets as quoted in active markets .
Changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity through the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity with the exception of impairment losses which are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income .
The cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is recycled to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income when an available for sale financial asset is derecognised or impaired .
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are nonderivative assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market .
They are included in current assets except where they have maturities of more than 12 months after the end of the reporting period in which case they are classified as noncurrent assets .
The Groups loans and receivables are recognised within trade and other receivables .
Heldtomaturity
Heldtomaturity financial assets are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinate payments and fixed maturities that the Groups management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity .
Heldtomaturity financial assets are measured at amortised cost .
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event where it is probable that it will result in an outflow of economic benefits and can be reliably estimated .
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation .
Where the outflow is not probable or cannot be reliably measured the potential obligation is disclosed as a contingent liability in the financial statements .
Insurance recoveries relating to legal fees are recognised when and only when it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received if the corresponding obligation is settled .
Reimbursements received are disclosed net in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and gross in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position .
Client compensation Complaints are assessed on a casebycase basis and provisions for compensation are made where it is judged necessary .
Principal accounting policies continued n Investments in joint ventures continued 48 Brooks Macdonald Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2017  continued Principal accounting policies continued q Foreign currency translation The Groups functional and presentational currency is the Pound Sterling .
Foreign currency transactions are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the transaction date .
At the reporting date monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the prevailing rates on that date .
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from settlement of such transactions and from the translation of periodend monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income .
Contributions in respect of the Groups defined contribution pension scheme are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as they fall due .
Tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax .
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years .
Deferred tax is provided in full using the liability method on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Groups financial statements .
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability settled based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date .
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised .
Trade receivables are initially recognised and subsequently measured at the original invoice amount less an allowance for any amounts that are expected to be uncollectable .
Doubtful debts are provided for when the collection of the full amount is no longer probable whilst bad debts are immediately written off when identified .
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers .
These are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within 12 months or less or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer .
Otherwise they are presented as noncurrent liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position .
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method .
Rent payments due under operating leases are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis over the term of the lease .
Where leases include lease incentives such as rentfree periods the benefit of these incentives is recognised over the lease term as a reduction in the rental expense .
The Group classifies financial instruments or their component parts on initial recognition as a financial asset a financial liability or an equity instrument in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement .
Financial instruments are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at fair value when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument .
Brooks Macdonald Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2017  continued Principal accounting policies continued x Employee Benefit Trust EBT The Company provides finance to an EBT to purchase the Companys shares on the open market in order to meet its obligation to provide shares when an employee exercises certain options or awards made under the Groups sharebased payment schemes .
The administration and finance costs connected with the EBT are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income .
The cost of the shares held by the EBT is deducted from equity .
A transfer is made between other reserves and retained earnings over the vesting periods of the related share options or awards to reflect the ultimate proceeds receivable from employees on exercise .
The trustees have waived their rights to receive dividends on the shares .
The EBT is considered to be a Structured Entity as defined in note 35 .
In substance the activities of the trust are being conducted on behalf of the Group according to its specific business needs in order to obtain benefits from its operation .
On this basis the assets held by the trust are consolidated into the Groups financial statements .
Ordinary share capital is classified as equity .
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction net of tax from the proceeds .
Where the Company purchases its own equity share capital treasury shares the consideration paid including any directly incremental costs i . e . shares are cancelled or reissued .
Where such ordinary shares are subsequently reissued any consideration received net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects is included within equity attributable to the Companys equity holders .
The dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividend is authorised and no longer at the discretion of the Company .
Final dividends are recognised when approved by the Companys shareholders at the annual general meeting and interim dividends are recognised when paid .

The carrying amount of goodwill at 30 June 2017 comprises 3550000 in respect of the Braemar Group Limited Braemar CGU 21243000 in respect of the Brooks Macdonald Asset Management International Limited Brooks Macdonald Retirement Services International Limited and DPZ collectively Brooks Macdonald International CGU and 9227 000 in respect of the Levitas Investment Management Services Limited Levitas CGU .
Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment and its recoverability has been assessed at 30 June 2017 by comparing the carrying amount of the CGUs to their expected recoverable amount estimated on a valueinuse basis .
The valueinuse of each CGU has been calculated using pretax discounted cash flow projections based on the most recent budgets approved by the relevant subsidiary company boards of directors covering a period of five years .
Cash flows are then extrapolated beyond the forecast period using an expected longterm growth rate .
Based on a valueinuse calculation the recoverable amount of the Levitas CGU at 30 June 2017 was 9319000 .
This was lower than the carrying amount of the CGU reflecting both a reduction in forecast funds under management growth and an increase in the discount rate applied indicating that it should be impaired .
An impairment loss of 1986000 2016 nil has been recognised against the goodwill attributable to the CGU and is shown in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income within other gains and losses .
Brooks Macdonald Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2017  continued Intangible assets continued a Goodwill continued The key underlying assumptions of the calculation are the discount rate the growth in funds under management of the Levitas funds and the longterm growth rate of the business .
A pretax discount rate of 10% 2016 8% has been used based on the Groups assessment of the riskfree rate of interest and specific risks pertaining to Levitas .
Annual funds under management growth rates of between 5% and 18% are forecast in the next five financial years the period covered by the most recent forecasts which reflect historic actual growth and planned management activities which are considered to be achievable given current market and industry trends .
A 2% longterm growth rate is applied to cash flows beyond the forecast period and is considered prudent in the context of the longterm average growth rate for the funds industry in which the CGU operates .
Reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions and the impact of these changes on the calculated recoverable amount are A 1 % change in the pretax discount rate would result in a 1041000 change in the recoverable amount .
A 10% change in the forecast funds under management would result in a 630000 change in the recoverable amount .
A 0 .5% change in the longterm average growth rate would result in a 489000 change in the recoverable amount .
As the Levitas CGU has been impaired in the year any future adverse change in any of the key assumptions would cause the CGUs carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount and an additional impairment would then be recognised .
Based on a valueinuse calculation the recoverable amount of the Brooks Macdonald International CGU at 30 June 2017 was 42043000 indicating that there is no impairment .
The key underlying assumptions of the calculation are the discount rate the shortterm growth in earnings and the longterm growth rate of the business .
A pretax discount rate of 10% has been used based on the Groups assessment of the riskfree rate of interest and specific risks relating to Brooks Macdonald International .
Annual earnings growth rates of between 18% and 48% are forecast over the next five financial years the period covered by the most recent forecasts which reflect historic actual growth and planned management actions and are considered to be achievable given current market and industry trends .
The 2% longterm growth rate applied is considered prudent in the context of the longterm average growth rate for the funds investment management and financial planning industries in which the CGU operates .
The key assumptions inherent in the valueinuse calculations for the Braemar CGU were a pretax discount rate of 11% annual revenue growth rates ranging from 10% to 28% and a longterm growth rate of 2% .
Headroom exists in the calculations of the respective recoverable amounts of the Brooks Macdonald International and Braemar CGUs over the carrying amounts of the goodwill allocated to them .
On this basis the directors have concluded that there is no impairment .
The directors consider that no reasonably foreseeable change in any of the key assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill given the margin by which the estimated recoverable amounts of the CGUs exceed the carrying amounts of the goodwill allocated to each .
Computer software costs are amortised on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life of four years .
Costs incurred on internally developed computer software are initially recognised at cost and when the software is available for use the costs are amortised on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life of four years .

The preference shares carry an entitlement to a fixed preferential dividend at a rate of 8% per annum .
In the year ended 30 June 2016 an impairment loss of 311000 was recognised in relation to the investment in the Student Accommodation Fund reflecting the permanent diminution in the net asset value of the fund .

Consequently the Group has a limited exposure to interest rate risk due to fluctuations in the prevailing level of market interest rates .
A 1% fall in the average monthly interest rate receivable on the Groups cash and cash equivalents would have the impact of reducing interest receivable and therefore profit before taxation by 322000 2016 195000 .
An increase of 1% would have an equal and opposite effect .
Foreign exchange risk The Group does not have any material exposure to transactional foreign currency risk and therefore no analysis of foreign exchange risk is provided .
Price risk Price risk is the risk that the fair value of the future cash flows from financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk .
The Group is exposed to price risk through its holdings of equity securities and other financial assets which are measured at fair value in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position notes 15 and 19 .
A 1% fall in the value of these financial instruments would have the impact of reducing total comprehensive income by 18000 2016 27 000 and profit before tax by 12000 2016 10000 .
An increase of 1% would have an equal and opposite effect .
The Group may elect to invest surplus cash balances in highly liquid money market instruments with maturity dates not exceeding three months .
The difference between the fair value and the net book value of these instruments is not material .
To reduce the risk of a counterparty default the Group deposits the rest of its funds in approved high quality banks .
At 30 June 2017 there was no significant concentration of credit risk in any particular counterparty 2016 none .

Trade receivables with a carrying amount of 1723000 2016 5939000 are neither past due nor impaired .
Trade receivables have no external credit rating as they relate to individual clients although the value of investments held in each individual clients portfolio is always in excess of the total value of the receivable .

Guarantees and contingent liabilities A claim for unspecified losses has been made by a client against Brooks Macdonald Financial Consulting Limited a subsidiary of the Group in relation to alleged negligent financial advice .
The claimant has not yet advised the quantum of their claim so it is not possible to reliably estimate the potential impact of a ruling in their favour .
There remains significant uncertainty surrounding the claim and the Groups legal advice indicates that it is not probable that the claim will be upheld therefore no provision for any liability has been recognised at this stage .

The Group holds client assets to fund such trading activity .
Additional levies by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme may give rise to further obligations based on the Groups income in the current or previous years .
Nevertheless the ultimate cost to the Group of these levies remains uncertain and is dependent upon future claims resulting from institutional failures .
