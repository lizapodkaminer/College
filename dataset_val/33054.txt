Earnings per share before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items have been calculated since these charges can have a distorting effect on the trend of underlying earnings. markets and rising consumer confidence.
Instead as the year progressed it became clear that 2002 would be another very challenging year for business.
The majority of our major markets with the notable exception of China experienced little or no economic growth and fragile consumer confidence.
The weakness in global stock markets and the effect on individual and household net worth and consumer sentiment gave cause for widespread concern as did the continuing anxiety over the threat of terrorism and particularly in the latter half of the year the increased threat to global security.
When one adds to this mix of negative factors the shocking revelations of corporate malfeasance and large corporate failures principally in the United States during the year it is perhaps surprising that consumer behaviour was not even more seriously affected.
With this as the geopolitical and economic backdrop I am pleased to record that ICI finished the year in sounder shape financially than it was a year earlier.
Thanks to strong shareholder support for the Rights Issue in the first quarter combined with the proceeds from the sale of assets and tightly focused management of working capital your Companys balance sheet has been substantially strengthened.
These actions to reduce Group debt were successful in protecting our credit rating.
With the actions taken during 2002 behind us the shape and structure of the Group is now essentially set and our primary focus for the future will be on the growth and development of our International Businesses.
Despite the weak economic environment the International Businesses turned in a creditable performance.
The Group achieved sales of 6125m in 2002 5% lower than in 2001 mainly due to business disposals and exchange translation effects.
Profit before tax at 400m was essentially the same as in 2001 and earnings per share for 2002 were 23.7p both quoted before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items.
The dividend for the year was 7.5p.
As we look to 2003 we believe it would be prudent to assume that the competitive environment will continue to be challenging and that high levels of customer satisfaction will require the very highest levels of quality value and technology.
This standard of performance must be achieved with world class productivity and overall business efficiency to achieve satisfactory financial results.
The ICI team is dedicated to achieving these imperatives.
We have a highly skilled and motivated management and workforce and immense technological capability.
Our products number in the tens of thousands and we compete in a wide range of market segments including food personal care home improvement and adhesives.
We believe that our extensive product and technology base provides us with a solid foundation on which to build.
As in 2002 the efficient use of capital will be of the highest priority.
We will continue to compete vigorously in all of the worlds major market places and will place particular emphasis on the high growth countries.
And finally a comment on governance.
ICI has a long history of adhering to a strong ethical code.
It is a tradition of which we are proud and as custodians of that tradition we are deeply conscious of the trust that you have placed in us. governance financial control and reporting.
I would like to thank you again for your support for the Rights Issue in early 2002 and on behalf of the entire ICI team give you our pledge that we will continue to do all in our power to deliver value to you our shareholders.
chairmans statement
Lord Trotman Chairman ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS AND FORM 20F 2002 2002 was a significant year for ICI and although the hopedfor global economic upturn did not materialise we emerged in substantially better shape than a year earlier.
The early months of the year were dominated by the successful execution of the Rights Issue which raised net proceeds of just over 800m making it one of the largest to date in
It received excellent and much appreciated support with shareholders taking up more than 91% of the rights.
Once again Id like to thank shareholders for confirming their confidence that ICIs strategy is the right one to deliver long term success.
The intended sale of Synetix our catalyst business was announced in February.
A sale agreement with Johnson Matthey was concluded in September and the divestment was subsequently completed with gross proceeds of 260m.
In June we also reached agreement with CSFB Global Opportunities Partners for the sale of ICIs interest in Huntsman International Holdings.
We received an initial cash payment of 160m 109m with the balance of 280m 174m payable before the end of May 2003.
The combination of the Rights Issue divestment proceeds and our success in improving organic cash generation reduced the level of yearend debt from almost 3bn in 2001 to less than 1.7bn in 2002.
Interest cover for the year rose from 3.5 to 4.3 times.
With structurally lower levels of debt ICI exited 2002 with a balance sheet that provides a solid foundation from which to grow the profit of our core specialty products and paints businesses.
Performance 2002 In performance terms our businesses once again demonstrated resilience in economically difficult times.
Profit before tax goodwill amortisation and exceptional items of 400m was only 1m lower than last year.
Our International Businesses delivered comparable sales growth of 1% and trading profit of 543m that was only 1% lower on a comparable basis.
Given the weakness in most major Western economies this was a creditable performance.
Overall gross margin percentages in the International Businesses were maintained at last years level and fixed costs were well controlled.
The Groups net operating cash flow improved substantially for the year particularly with the benefits of further working capital efficiency improvements in the International Businesses.
The International Businesses achieved comparable sales growth in three regions of the world with the strongest growth in Asia.
The Group also performed well in North America and Europe seen against the backdrop of lower economic growth.
And whilst sales in hard currency terms were down in Latin America the significant weakening of the exchange rates in Argentina and Brazil were primary contributors to this.
Paints once again led the way despite the difficult economic conditions in Latin America with continued doubledigit sales and profit growth in Asia and good performances in both Europe and North America.
National Starch improved sales and profit with excellent progress in Asia and a return to growth in North America.
Its
Food and Industrial Starches and Specialty Synthetic Polymers also delivered good sales growth. demand down.
The picture improved somewhat as the year progressed but yearonyear comparable profits fell 24% although the high growth potential areas of lubricants and personal care were more encouraging with sales growth of 9% and 4% respectively.
Quest achieved good sales growth in North America and Asia.
Fine fragrances performed particularly strongly.
However problems in the second quarter with new supply chain systems caused an order backlog at our major Food site in the Netherlands.
Although the problem was largely rectified by October production was disrupted for a period.
Quest is determined to restore its reputation for excellent customer service.
For our Regional and Industrial businesses higher profits in Pakistan and Argentina were offset by the loss of profits from divested businesses and a legal provision.
Despite the respectable overall performance I regret that I cannot report the improvement in ICIs share price for which we are all working.
Against our selected peer group our ranking in terms of Total Shareholder Return remained 13 of 17.
This performance is disappointing.
The Board and I continue to believe that ICI has all the necessary components for an improved placing and are committed to achieving that improvement.
I remain convinced that given the improved strength of our balance sheet our stated goals  organic sales growth of 4 to 5% 1 to 2% above global GDP plus another 1 to 2% growth from synergistic bolton acquisitions  are achievable once economies improve.
We believe that this in combination with improved operational effectiveness will provide the basis for consistent longerterm profit growth.
Exciting progress Were already making progress on a number of fronts.
We are launching innovative new products across the Group such as Paints onecoat elastomeric Polycell Basecoat which was an instant success in the UK.
Our science and technology function continues to enhance its reputation.
National Starch researchers for example are working with the US Army Research Laboratories developing sealants and encapsulants to protect tomorrows flexible flat screens from moisture and oxygen.
Some of our largest global customers have expressed interest in understanding how ICI businesses technology and knowhow might be leveraged in collaborations to generate longterm added value for their product development programmes.
ICI is focused on growth and we have an increasing number of people in the regions with significant potential.
In China an important growth market we now have 1400 employees up from some 900 only four years ago and we continue to invest in manufacturing and marketing facilities in the country.
ICI is global but our success is often built on local management able to understand and respond to local consumer and customer requirements.
In May we published The ICI Report on the Secrets of the Senses Dr Charles Spence of Oxford Universitys ground breaking research into the importance of sensory experience for health and emotional wellbeing.
This helped focus attention on ICIs expertise in the growth areas of the science of sight scent taste and touch the heart of our business today.
Our people In conclusion I want to thank our employees all around the world for the dedication and effort that delivered commendable results under difficult conditions.
When the tide turns I know we will be ready.
Brendan ONeill Chief Executive ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS AND FORM 20F 2002
ICI is one of the worlds leading specialty products and paints businesses with products and ingredients developed for a wide range of consumer and industrial markets.
In 1997 ICI began the process of refocusing the business from commodity chemicals into higher value added specialty products and paints addressing specific and specialised customer needs.
This transformation is now essentially complete.
The Groups businesses are now more knowledge intensive than capital intensive and focused on delivering innovative products to customers in a wide range of sectors of the world economy.
The specialty products and paint businesses referred to as the International Businesses comprise National Starch Quest Performance Specialties and Paints.
These businesses serve diverse consumer and industrial markets through some 40 strategic business units comprising close to 100 operating units with an array of market leadership positions across the world.
In addition a number of Regional and Industrial businesses remain in ICIs portfolio.
ICI believes that its International Businesses have a quality customer and product mix strong management teams and potential for profitable growth.
The higher growth potential businesses include electronic and engineering materials specialty food starches flavours and fragrances personal care ingredients lubricants and in Asia adhesives and decorative paints.
Group Strategy The Groups businesses operate across a wide spectrum of consumer and industrial markets and across a wide geographic spread.
Its
This requires ICI to achieve profitable organic sales growth.
The key aspects of this strategy are to focus on higher value added specialty products and brands serve a wide range of markets including a number of niche markets develop longterm relationships with customers by addressing their specific and specialised needs innovate and use technology creatively to facilitate organic growth invest in growth markets and build leading market positions grow through organic growth supplemented by small strategic bolton acquisitions in its chosen growth areas improve its operational performance and pursue synergies across the Group.
In order to implement its strategy the Group aims to attract train and develop talented people and to maintain a strong commitment to safety health and the environment.
Group Financial Objectives The Groups financial objectives derive from a combination of top down goals and a biannual strategic planning process.
These strategic financial objectives then form the basis for all financial targets.
At the Group level management is focused on achieving the following goals over the medium term.
While demanding management believes they should be achievable.
Sales growth With respect to sales management is aiming to achieve organic growth of 4 to 5% per annum on average 1 to 2% over assumed
Subject to the right opportunities becoming available management is aiming to achieve on average a further 1 to 2% growth per annum through small strategic bolton acquisitions in its chosen growth areas.
Trading margin expansion Average trading margin before amortisation of goodwill and exceptional items for the Group in 2002 was 9% 2001 9%.
Management is aiming to achieve an improvement in trading margin of approximately 0.5% per annum on average over the next 4 to 5 years.
Recent history In July 1997 ICI took a major step to reposition its business towards the higher added value sector of the industry with the acquisition of the companies and businesses comprising the Speciality Chemicals division of Unilever PLC and Unilever N. of 8 billion 4.8 billion.
This acquisition was consistent with its strategy to shift its business profile towards products which meet specific customer needs and to areas where leading positions in profitable growth markets can be won through the application of its technology and skills.
Consistent with the Groups strategy ICI has divested nearly all of its industrial chemicals portfolio including its Polyester Fertilisers Tioxide Petrochemicals ChlorChemicals and Klea businesses.
Since
July 1997 ICI has divested more than 50 businesses with proceeds from the sale of assets and businesses in excess of 7.0 billion.
In addition it has continued to reposition its business towards higher added value sectors of the industry through a number of acquisitions within the international specialty and paints businesses.
ICI believes that it has now essentially completed the transformation of the Group.
However the Group will continue to look for opportunities to grow its business both organically and through small strategic bolton acquisitions thereby strengthening its portfolio.
In 2001 ICI initiated a wide ranging restructuring programme across all of its International Businesses in order to underpin future growth and provide cost savings and working capital improvements.

Seasonality
Due to the diversity of their product portfolios and broad international coverage seasonality in the National Starch Quest and Uniqema businesses is not significant.
ICI Paints however is affected with higher sales of products used on the exterior of buildings normally during better weather conditions.
With the geographic profile of ICI Paints this results in higher activity levels in the second and third quarters of the year.
Sources and availability of raw materials Raw materials and supplies are purchased from a variety of industry sources principally the agricultural and chemical sectors and to a lesser extent from the mining sector.
They are generally available from multiple suppliers and alternative sources are generally available to enable business to continue in the event of any interruption from present sources.
Prices are subject to normal conditions of supply and demand.
The primary raw materials used by National Starch are corn tapioca and chemicals.
Specialty hybrid corn high amylose and waxy seeds is planted under contract for National Starch to guarantee supply of these special strains.
Starch manufacturing facilities in Thailand are located close to the sources of production of tapioca root to ensure reliability of supply.
National Starchs main chemical raw material is vinyl acetate monomer the cost and supply of which is dependent on the price of natural gas and manufacturing capacity of suppliers.
Quest purchases thousands of different raw materials from sources across the world.
The main natural raw materials are extracts and concentrates from fruits vegetables and other flora as well as animal products and essential oils.
Synthetic raw material purchases are mostly organic chemicals.

A significant portion of the expenditure relates to information technology and to the support of customers including tinting machines Paints and creative systems Quest.
Commitments for capital expenditure not provided in the Groups consolidated financial statements totalled 163m at 31 December 2002 compared with 146m at the end of the previous year.
These are analysed further in note 40 to the consolidated financial statements between those for which contracts have been placed and those authorised but not yet contracted.
Research and development RandD A Technology Board comprising the senior business RandD managers and led by the Group Vice President for RandD is responsible for the development of the Groups Technology Strategy and its implementation by the RandD staff employed by the Groups businesses.
In 2002 expenditure on RandD by continuing operations excluding Technical Service amounted to 148m 2001 151m 2000 157m  both as restated.
This expenditure represented 2.4% of sales in 2002 up from 2.3% in 2001 and the same as in 2000.
Each of the Groups businesses is responsible for its own RandD resources and for driving innovation to meet the needs of its customers and markets.
The business RandD teams are complemented by a central RandD resource that aims to provide world class capabilities that are common to all the businesses.
Its capabilities are in colloid interface science high throughput experimentation HTE modelling particle engineering and polymer science.
It also provides measurement science services to the ICI businesses as well as undertaking a small measurement science development programme.
The Groups distributed technology network draws on the expertise across ICI thus allowing new products and processes to be developed and exploited by individual businesses more rapidly and stimulating new options from the combination of the technical capabilities of the Groups different businesses.
In 2002 a Business Development Board was established comprising senior managers from the individual Businesses the Group Vice President of RandD planning support from the Corporate Centre and chaired by the Executive Vice President Performance Specialties.
The purpose of the Board is to accelerate the commercial exploitation of technology opportunities within ICI and reflects the desire to continuously develop and strengthen the links between market needs and technology capability.
The Groups prime technology areas namely biosciences chemistry and materials have been established to support its goals in selected growth markets.
These areas or megathemes constitute a portfolio of projects which are intended to accelerate the Groups longterm technology development and avoid business duplication while reducing individual business risk.
Bioscience has key areas of knowledge and expertise which the Group applies to the development of personal care food and beverage products.
Projects under way focus on the use of natural materials linking consumer response to the molecular constituents of the Groups products and the development of superior product effects through improved understanding of skin science.
An example is the collaboration with Arena Pharmaceuticals Inc to apply Arenas proprietary CART technology to olfactory and gustatory G protein coupled receptors GPCRs to develop assays and then screen compounds supplied by ICI businesses.
Chemistry underpins much of the Groups product development and here its focus is on high throughput RandD to explore novel molecules formulations and processes.
A successful collaboration with Symyx Inc has made it possible to rapidly build an ICI Centre of Expertise in High Throughput Screening and Formulation which is now advancing a portfolio of projects for the ICI Businesses.
Investments in HTE capability continue at Quest and are beginning in Paints.
Current projects in the materials area are directed towards bio materials and renewable resources exploiting effects shown by biopolymers and biomolecules and increasing the Groups ability to fabricate at the nanoscale for macroscale effects.
The combination of these capabilities is particularly focused on controlled and targeted delivery of effect products e.
Starch and Uniqema has already led to the launch of two new crop protection products Metasperse dispersants and Semkote seed coatings.
The competitive edge of the Group comes from the combination of these capabilities not merely the demonstration of excellence in any one megatheme area.
Nowhere is this more evident than in ICIs ability to offer products with a multisensory touch taste fragrance and colour dimension.
The power and opportunity that this approach offers is displayed in the ICI report on The Secrets of the Senses commissioned from Dr Charles Spence from the Department of Experimental Psychology at the University of Oxford.
Regulation safety health and the environment ICIs businesses are subject to the normal regulatory framework applicable to a specialty products and paints company notably various health safety and environmental rules both at national and local levels in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates.
Its businesses also voluntarily conform to international and national codes of best practice appropriate to their business.
ICI attaches great importance to the safety and health of its employees to reducing any adverse environmental impact of its activities yearonyear and to developing products and services with improved environmental features.
Most aspects of the Groups business are subject to laws relating to safety health and environment SHE.
The scope and severity of such laws vary across the different businesses and according to the jurisdiction concerned.
The various manufacturing processes which are operated require consents and licences including relevant emission permits.
The Group requires full compliance by its businesses with all relevant SHE laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which it operates.
ICIs policy is to improve its SHE performance continuously and to have in place quantitative measures to monitor progress.
For these reasons ICI published a set of targets in 2001 to be achieved by the end of the year 2005 for improvements in Safety Health and the Environment Challenge 2005.
Targets for the last of these included reducing its environmental burden in specific categories and a commitment to improve energy efficiency per tonne of production by a further 5% of the 2000 base level.
ICI developed the measurement of environmental burden in order to take account not just of the quantity of an emission but its potential impact on the environment.
It uses the environmental burden methodology to help prioritise actions for further performance improvement.
ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS AND FORM 20F 2002 Challenge 2005 focuses on the effects of the Groups activities on climate change land water and other potential impacts using the environmental burden concept introduced in 1995 and to achieve a further 50% reduction in employee injuries and illnesses from the 2000 outurn.
We maintain our focus on SHE and in the second year of our current fiveyear programme are on plan to meet the majority of our Challenge 2005 objectives and have actions in place to address those areas where we are behind.
Full details are published in our Sustainability Report and on our website site ICIs performance in 2002 is currently being verified by Enviros Consulting Ltd and the detailed performance results and verification statement will be published on its website.
During 2002 there were eleven instances of breaches of safety health or environmental regulations which resulted in prosecutions or fines totalling 95000.
Each was investigated and appropriate action taken.
The main process by which the Group manages SHE issues and seeks to meet its objectives is the Responsible Care Management System
This sets out standards along with guidelines training auditing and procedures for reviewing and reporting performance all of which are essential to continuous improvement.
The system covers operations on site as well as product stewardship and community relations.
RCMS has been independently verified by Lloyds Register Quality Assurance Limited as complying with the US and UK Responsible Care Codes the certifiable international standard for environmental management systems ISO 14001 and the ICC International Chamber of Commerce Business Charter for Sustainable Development.
ICI works to manage and minimise the risks associated with the condition of its sites and has developed further procedures to enable the ranking of priorities for management attention.
ICI is actively engaged in research aimed at developing and implementing more cost effective environmental remediation technologies some of which is being done in collaboration with other companies and academic institutes.
The raw materials which the Groups businesses use and the products which they produce are subject to demanding regulations concerning product safety in all parts of the world.
These regulations which also cover product testing and risk assessment requirements are subject to review and revision as is currently happening in Europe with the European Union Chemicals Policy White Paper.
The Group is assessing the potential impact of these proposals on its businesses and will ensure compliance when the new European Union regulations come into force.
There is a growing pressure from legislators customers and the general public to reduce the environmental and health impacts of products throughout their life cycle.
ICI is responding to this by ensuring that each business has a Product Stewardship programme in place.
This voluntary programme embraces through best business practices product regulatory requirements societal pressures reducing the risk of harm to people and the environment and ICI aims to provide the relevant information to enable correct use and disposal of products.
Anticipating external pressures and concerns and providing speedy innovative solutions with lower environmental impact is becoming a key aspect of sustaining competitive advantage.
ICI recognises these pressures and is responding with the introduction of new processes products and services which improve the efficiency of use of raw materials and utilities and reduce adverse environmental effects.
Processes are in place for regular reviews of environmental liabilities and provisions were established by 31 December 2002 in accordance with the accounting policy described in the Group financial statements on page 51.
Although there can be no guarantees management believes that within the existing legislative framework and taking account of the provisions already established the cost of addressing currently identified environmental obligations as ICI currently views these obligations is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.
Litigation
Save as disclosed below neither ICI nor any of its subsidiaries is involved in any legal or arbitration proceedings which may have or have had during the 12 months preceding the date of this document a material effect on the financial position of the Group nor are any such proceedings pending or threatened involving ICI or any of its subsidiaries.
The Glidden Company Glidden a wholly owned subsidiary of ICI is a defendant along with former lead paint and pigment producers as well as other lead product manufacturers and their trade associations in a number of suits in the United States.
These suits seek damages for alleged personal injury caused by leadbased paint or the costs of removing leadbased paint.
An alleged predecessor of Glidden manufactured lead pigments until the 1950s and leadbased consumer paint until the 1960s.
Due to the nature of the suits Glidden is unable to quantify the amount being claimed although the suits are likely to involve substantial claims for damages.
The cases presently pending against Glidden include a suit filed in 1989 by the New York City Housing Authority in New York state court seeking the removal of all leadbased paint from two housing projects a purported statewide personal injury class action filed in 1998 on behalf of all lead poisoned children in New York state court a personal injury suit filed in 1999 on behalf of six lead poisoned minors in state court in Maryland and a personal injury action filed in 2002 on behalf of a lead poisoned adult in state court in Mississippi.
Five other individual personal injury actions were filed in 2000 and 2001 against Glidden and other members of the lead industry in Maryland state court however these actions have not been served on any of the defendants and no activity is expected for the foreseeable future.
One additional personal injury action was filed in late 2002 in New York state court but Glidden has not been served in that case.
Glidden has been dismissed from seventeen cases in 2002 and was not named as a defendant in more than two dozen lead paint lawsuits filed this year.
Glidden continues to believe that it has strong defences to all of the pending cases and has denied all liability and will continue to vigorously defend all actions.
ICI Chemicals and Polymers Limited CandP a subsidiary is involved in arbitration proceedings in Singapore regarding PTA technology exchange and licence arrangements with PT Polyprima Karyareksa
Fees due under these arrangements are being claimed against Polyprima who in response has claimed damages totalling up to 130m for alleged breach of contract alleged fraud deceit misrepresentation and concealment allegations which CandP rejects and intends to resist vigorously.
CandPs claim against Polyprima was heard before an arbitration tribunal in Singapore in May 2002 and the decision of the tribunal is awaited.
In connection with the disposal of the Groups ChlorChemicals business to Ineos Chlor Ineos Chlor has made a 65m claim against the Group relating to expenditure allegedly required in relation to the Runcorn site which the Group is disputing.
As yet legal proceedings 19 have not been commenced by Ineos Chlor but it is possible that they will be in the near future.
Ineos Chlor has also approached the UK Department of Trade and Industry to seek Regional Selective Assistance for certain capital projects and is also seeking financial support from its parent company and the Group.
ICI has received reports that Ineos Chlor may seek to close part or all of its business if this financial support is not forthcoming.
If such a closure was to occur a number of Chlor Chemicals contracts in the Groups name which have not yet been novated to Ineos Chlor and certain environmental liabilities could revert to the Group or be accelerated.
Employees
As of 31 December 2002 ICI employed 36660 employees.
An analysis of employee numbers by business and geographical area may be found in note 36 to the consolidated financial statements.
ICI has a mixture of unionised and nonunionised operations across the world.
ICI considers its relations with its employees to be good.
Property
ICI operates production marketing and research and development facilities worldwide.
The individual business descriptions on the preceding pages provide details of these facilities.
ICI owns substantially all of its properties free of material encumbrances and it believes such properties are adequate for their purposes and suitably utilised according to the individual nature and requirements of the relevant properties.
Insurance
ICI maintains the types and amounts of insurance customary in the industries and countries in which it operates.
This includes but is not limited to Employee Related Accidents and Injury policies Property Damage policies and Directors and Officers liability coverage.
CI considers its insurance coverage to be adequate both as to the nature of the risks covered and the amounts insured for the businesses conducted by the Group.
The insurance market since the terrorist attacks on the United States on 11 September 2001 has become far more expensive and limited in coverage availability.
There are indications that insurance costs will continue to increase and that the scope of coverage available in the market will become more limited.
As reported International Business trading profit was 5% lower than last year with the difference from the comparable performance due to the effects of foreign exchange translation 2% and divestments 2%.
Regional and Industrial businesses reported a 10m trading loss for the year 14m lower than in 2001 2000 17m profit due to the loss of profits from divested businesses and a legal provision in relation to one of ICIs former businesses.
Associates
The Groups share of losses of associates before exceptional items for the year was of 10m in line with last year 2001 10m loss 2000 40m profit.
Reduced losses from Huntsman International Holdings LLC which ceased to be accounted for as an associate from 17 June 2002 were offset by losses in Irish Fertilizer Industries which went into liquidation in November 2002.
The Group result included the Groups share of operating profit before exceptional items from associates of 18m 2001 57m 2000 100m less net interest payable by associates of 28m 2001 67m 2000 60m.
Interest
The Group net interest charge for the year was 123m compared to 162m in 2001 2000 202m excluding exceptional interest income primarily as a result of lower average net debt following the successful completion of the Rights Issue and lower interest rates during the year.
Profit before tax Profit before tax goodwill amortisation and exceptional items for the year was 400m 1m lower than last year 2000 450m.
Lower trading profits for the International Businesses by 26m and a loss for Regional and Industrial businesses were almost entirely offset by the lower interest costs.
Profit before tax but after goodwill amortisation and exceptional items was 317m compared to 205m in 2001 2000 87m loss including the provision for loss on the sale of the ChlorChemicals Klea and Crosfield operations of 503m.
During 2002 the adverse currency translation effect compared to last year on the Groups reported profit before tax goodwill amortisation and exceptional items was 11m.
Exceptional items There was no net exceptional charge to trading profit in 2002 2001 143m loss relating to the restructuring programme to improve cost effectiveness and supply chain efficiencies across the International Businesses 2000 nil.
ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS AND FORM 20F 2002
Group sales as reported for the year were 6125m 5% lower than 2001 6425m in 2001 and 6415m in 2000 or 7748m including discontinued operations.
The lower sales in 2002 were largely the consequence of divestments principally in the Regional and Industrial businesses and adverse foreign exchange translation effects.
International Business sales at 5543m were 1% ahead of 2001 on a comparable basis.
Growth resumed in North America and remained strong in Asia more than offsetting lower sales in Latin America where economic conditions remained challenging.
Sales in Europe were slightly ahead of the prior year.
Each of the International Businesses delivered comparable sales growth with National Starch and Performance Specialties both 2% ahead and Paints and Quest both 1% ahead of last year.
As reported sales for the International Businesses were 2% below 2001 2001 5645m 2000 5570m with the effects of foreign exchange translation 2% and divestments in Performance Specialties 1% accounting for the difference from the comparable performance.
Trading profit Group trading profit for the year was 533m 7% lower than 2001 2001 573m 2000 617m or 612m including discontinued operations.
Trading profit for the International Businesses for the year at 543m 2001 569m 2000 600m was only 1% lower than 2001 on a comparable basis.
Paints and National Starch both made good progress in difficult conditions and were up 9% and 5% respectively on a comparable basis.
However comparable trading profit was 23% lower for Quest which was impacted by supply chain problems and 24% lower for Performance Specialties with Uniqema being particularly affected by rising raw material prices in the second half of the year.

A reconciliation between comparable and as reported performance measures can be found on pages 28 and 31.
A more detailed explanation of comparable performance appears on page 124.
There were also no exceptional losses from associates 2001 9m loss relating to a restructuring programme in Huntsman International Holdings LLC 2000 nil.
Exceptional items charged after trading profit for the year comprised a 50m profit from the sale or closure of operations 2001 7m profit 2000 515m loss and a 3m profit on the disposal of fixed assets 2001 8m profit 2000 11m profit and 99m written off investments 2001 22m 2000 nil.
In 2002 the pretax profit from the sale or closure of operations included a 90m profit on the sale of the Groups catalyst business Synetix and a 17m profit on the sale of the Security Systems business.
These were partially offset by a 32m loss on the divestment of the UK Nitrocellulose and Energetic Technologies businesses and a 27m loss due to the liquidation of Irish Fertilizer Industries in which the Group has a 49% interest.
Amounts written off investments in 2002 of 99m related to a provision against ICIs existing investments in Ineos Chlor where uncertainty exists as to the extent to which and period over which these amounts will be recovered.
In total exceptional items before tax and minority interests for 2002 amounted to a loss of 46m 2001 159m loss 2000 502m loss.
Exceptional items after tax and minorities were a loss of 48m 2001 142m loss 2000 456m loss.
Taxation
Taxation on profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items was 115m 1m lower than 2001 2000 142m with the Group effective rate being maintained at 29% 2000 32%.
Prior years have been restated for the effect of FRS No.19.
Net profit Net profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items was 264m compared to 259m in 2001 and 284m in 2000.
Net profit after goodwill amortisation and exceptional items was 179m compared to 80m in 2001 and a loss of 207m in 2000.
The results for 2001 and 2000 have been restated for the effect of FRS No.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items for the year were 23.7p compared to 29.8p in 2001 2000 32.7p.
Basic earnings per share after goodwill amortisation and exceptional items were 16.1p compared to 9.2p in 2001 2000 loss per share Prior years profit and earnings per share figures have been restated for the effects of the bonus element of the Rights Issue and for FRS 19.
The weighted average number of shares in issue in 2002 was 1114m compared to 869m in 2001 2000 869m.
Dividend and dividend policy As previously stated the Groups dividend policy is that dividends should represent about one third of net profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items.
In line with this policy the Board has recommended a second interim dividend of 4.5p to bring the total dividend for 2002 to 7.5p.
Shareholders funds The net profit for the year of 179m was reduced by dividends of 88m and an adverse movement through reserves due to foreign exchange of 57m but increased by the issue of new shares for the Rights Issue 807m and other goodwill items of 22m to give an overall net increase in shareholders funds in 2002 of 863m.
At the end of 2002 shareholders funds were in surplus of 499m 2001 deficit 364m 2000 deficit 249m.
The prior year figures have been restated for the effect of FRS No.
Performance and value based management The Group remains committed to value based management and further progress was made during the year.
The Group continued to focus on better utilisation of both fixed and working capital and average working capital as a percentage of sales in the International Businesses was reduced by over 1% on a comparable basis.
Despite lower trading profits for the International Businesses the return on average net assets in the International Businesses of 20% remained unchanged from 2001.
Cash flow The following analysis of Group cash flow which relates to the table on page 22 distinguishes between cash flows relating to operating activities and those related to portfolio reshaping and legacy issues.
Included within reshaping and legacy are gross proceeds from divestments cash expenditures following divestments including tax paid and payments against divestment provisions which in some cases will continue for a number of years the ICI UK Pension Fund topup payments and loans to associates and other investments.
Management believes this presentation provides important financial information relating to the continuing operating activities of the Group separate from cash flows relating to the divestment programme and the transformation of the Group.
This should not be considered as an alternative but as supplementary to the presentation of cash flows in accordance with UK GAAP included within the financial statements and related notes.

2002 2001 m m Net cash inflow from operating activities page 55 623 637 Less Capital expenditure note 27 page 90 219 235 Add Special topup pension payment deducted in arriving at net cash flow from operating activities above 30 30 Operating cash inflow after capital expenditure included in table above 434 432 Operating cash flow The Groups net operating cash flow improved significantly in 2002.
Group earnings before interest tax depreciation and goodwill amortisation for the year at 729m were 7% below 2001 mainly as a result of the lower trading profit for the International Businesses.
However the benefits of working capital efficiency improvements resulted in a small cash inflow from working capital of 13m for the year some 43m better than 2001.
Capital expenditure of 219m was also 16m lower while other cash items including exceptional outflows against restructuring provisions were at a similar level to 2001.
Consequently the Group delivered an operating cash inflow after capital expenditure of 434m 2m better than for 2001.
Net interest and tax payments excluding tax on divestments during 2002 amounted to 191m some 33m lower than 2001 primarily as a result of the cash interest benefits of the Rights Issue.
Dividend payments at 127m were 78m lower than last year following implementation of the revised dividend policy.
Acquisition expenditure was 17m 51m below 2001.
Overall for 2002 the Group generated a much improved net operating cash flow which at 99m was 164m better than for 2001.
Reshaping and legacy cash flows Reshaping and legacy cash flows benefited from the successful completion of the divestment of Synetix delivering gross proceeds of 260m and the proceeds 109m from the first installment in relation to the sale of ICIs interests in Huntsman International Holdings LLC.
Overall 2002 divestment proceeds of 458m were 114m more than for 2001.
Tax payments resulting from divestments were 8m down from 21m in the prior year.
Payments against divestment provisions were also significantly lower than last year down 165m to 133m.
The topup payment to the ICI UK Pension Fund for the year was maintained at 30m.
The next triennial actuarial review of the fund will take place at 31 March 2003.
Overall the 2002 cash flow due to reshaping and legacy items was an inflow of 250m 296m higher than 2001.
Movement in net debt Cash flow before financing for the year at 349m was 460m better than in 2001.
This together with the net Rights Issue proceeds of 807m and a favourable noncash exchange rate translation impact of 94m led to a 1250m reduction in net debt at the end of the year to 1667m.
Cash flow  UK GAAP This commentary relates to the Statement of Group cash flow on page 55 which is prepared in accordance with FRS No.1 revised.
The Group net cash inflow from operating activities for 2002 was 623m 14m lower than last year due mainly to lower trading profits.
Capital expenditure and financial investment for the year at 184m was 22m lower than 2001 with lower spend on tangible fixed assets and higher proceeds from the sale of fixed assets.
Returns from investments and servicing of finance and cash tax spend were also reduced.
ICI share price and FTSE 100 share price index pence per share month end ICI share price FTSE 100 rebased 80telSource Bloomberg Net proceeds from disposals were 290m against 17m last year and comprised 423m gross disposal proceeds 2001 315m less expenditure against divestment provisions of 133m 2001 298m.
Disposal proceeds in 2002 mainly related to the divestment of Synetix gross proceeds of 260m the first instalment in relation to the sale of ICIs interests in Huntsman International Holdings LLC 109m and the divestment of Security Systems.
Acquisition expenditure including investments in participating interests at 54m was also 55m lower than 2001.
The Group generated a cash inflow before the use of liquid resources of 349m in 2002 compared to a cash outflow of 111m in 2001.
The much improved cash flow was primarily due to the higher net disposal proceeds combined with lower equity dividends acquisition costs interest and tax payments.
Treasury policies The Groups Treasury seeks to reduce financial risk to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest cash assets safely and profitably.
It operates within policies and procedures approved by the Board which include strict controls on the use of financial instruments in managing the Groups risk.
The
Group does not undertake any trading activity in financial instruments.
The Group reviews the credit quality of counterparties and limits individual and aggregate credit exposures accordingly.
Financing and interest rate risk At 31 December 2002 the Groups net debt was 1667m 2001 2917m 2000 2799m.
The Groups policy is to finance the Group mainly through a mixture of retained earnings and debt.
Debt is principally sourced from long term loans mediumterm notes commercial paper securitised receivables and bank debt.
The Groups borrowings are primarily raised centrally by Group finance companies and onlent to operating subsidiaries on commercial terms.
The Group borrows in the major global debt markets in a range of currencies at both fixed and floating rates of interest and uses derivatives to generate the desired currency and interest rate profile of borrowings.
The Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings is managed through the use of interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements.
The Groups policy is to maintain between 40% and 60% of its longterm borrowings at fixed rates for periods of up to 5 years.
Notes 20 and 38 to the consolidated financial statements show the overall interest rate structure of the Groups borrowings at the end of 2002.
The Groups borrowings after taking account of swaps and forward contracts are denominated mainly in US Dollars.
Details of the currency mix of borrowings are shown in note 38 to the consolidated financial statements.
The currency disposition of the borrowings is used as a partial longterm hedge of the cash flows arising from investments overseas and as a hedge against any future business disposal proceeds.
In addition it takes into account the availability and costs of funds and the sensitivity of Group gearing and earnings ratios to exchange rate movements.
The maturity of loans is shown in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.
The Groups objective in determining borrowing maturity is to ensure a balance between flexibility cost and the continuing availability of funds.
As such it funds in a mix of longterm and short term maturity debt.
Funding policy aims to produce a reasonably even maturity profile for longterm debt up to around 5 years.
The average maturity for longterm debt was 2.5 years at 31 December 2002.
Liquidity and investments At 31 December 2002 the Group had at its disposal 1.509bn equivalent of committed borrowing facilities with varying maturities up to the year 2006.
Of this a 1100m committed borrowing facility is maturing in January 2004 and some 201m of shortterm committed borrowing facilities have varying maturities of less than one year.
These facilities provide backstopping for shortterm funding as well as flexibility to supplement future cash flows.
The Groups net debt position has historically changed over the course of a year and in particular shortterm debt has generally increased in the early part of the year to fund working capital requirements.
These working capital needs arise principally from the seasonality of the Paints business which experiences higher sales of products used on the exterior of buildings and thus working capital during the North American and European summer the second and third quarters of the year.
The Groups commercial paper programmes and other short term borrowings are used to fund these working capital fluctuations.
At 31 December 2002 the Group had 226m of shortterm borrowings outstanding.
During 2002 the principal movements in longterm debt were a 200m 129m 10 year note maturity and 500m and 250m 484m 5 year note maturities.
Also in 2002 the Group redeemed 300m in FRPS fixed rate redeemable preference shares reducing the amount outstanding at 31 December 2002 to 100m compared to 400m at 31 December 2001.
The Group runs a receivables securitisation programme in the US with 95m outstanding out of a total available facility of 111m at 31 December 2002.
This outstanding amount has been reported in the Groups financial statements under current instalment of loans note 20 to the consolidated financial statements and the available facility is included in its total committed borrowing facilities.
Off balance sheet financing mainly comprises the leases described in note 35 to the consolidated financial statements and a series of forward contracts total nominal amount of 122m as of 31 December 2002 used to hedge some of the obligations of the employee share ownership plans.
During 2003 500m of loans will be maturing which in addition to various bonds and notes includes the 100m of FRPS and 95m from the receivables securitisation programme.
These are expected to be refinanced through new debt issues.
Access to the full range of the debt markets which we currently enjoy requires us to maintain our investment grade credit rating.
Any downgrade of ICIs credit rating would reduce its funding options including a loss of access to the major commercial paper and money markets significantly increase its cost of borrowings and have an adverse effect on its results of operations and cash flow.
With respect to the sale of ICIs interest in Huntsman International Holdings LLC the remaining 280m 174m will be payable by Matlin Patterson Global Opportunities Partners L. to 15 May 2003 by means of instalment payments.
Other than the 160m 109m already received sums due from the purchaser will carry interest from May 2002 to the date of payment.
Under the arrangements with Ineos Chlor Limited described in note 40 to the consolidated financial statements a further 30m could be lent by the Group to Ineos Chlor.
The following table summarises ICIs principal contractual obligations at 31 December 2002 including installments which are described in the consolidated financial statements and related notes.
The table below only includes the contractual obligations which are described in the consolidated financial statements and excludes all other contractual obligations such as derivatives and other hedging instruments and also the nonnovated contracts referred to in the narrative of note 40 to the consolidated financial statements.
Further analysis of the individual obligations can be reviewed by reference to the notes indicated in the table below.

The Group partially hedges this effect by borrowing in currencies other than
The Group does not hedge translation exposures other than by passive use of currency borrowings.
The Group requires its subsidiaries to hedge their material transaction exposures sales and purchases in currencies other than their functional currency using forward contracts.
The majority of this hedging is performed by Group Treasury.
The Group selectively hedges its anticipated future trading cash flows up to 12 months ahead using forward contracts and purchased currency options.
The
Groups profits are denominated in many currencies across the world the most significant of which are the US dollar and related currencies.
The adverse impact due to translation exposures on the Group trading profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items of a 5% strengthening in Sterling against the US dollar is approximately 7m.
Counterparty credit risk The Groups counterparty credit risks arise mainly from noncentral operating cash held on shortterm bank deposit the positive mark to market effect of swaps and counterparty risk arising from the liquidity of the Groups captive insurance company.
The Group considers the risk of material loss in the event of nonperformance by a financial counterparty to be low.
Euro
Economic and Monetary Union EMU has been implemented in the twelve participating member states of the European Union.
These countries adopted the Euro as their only currency with effect from 1 January 2002.
These participating countries do not include the United Kingdom where ICI is headquartered.
The Groups strategy for trading with suppliers and customers in Continental Europe has been to facilitate the use of the Euro.
However for the time being the Group will continue to report its results in Sterling and keep under review the case for any redenomination of its share capital.
Although the introduction of the Euro eliminates exchange rate risks between the former currencies of participating countries while the UK remains outside of EMU and while ICI continues to report in Sterling the Group will remain exposed to potential foreign exchange fluctuations which occur between the Euro and Sterling.
The adverse impact due to translation exposures on the Group trading profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items of a 5% strengthening in Sterling against the Euro is approximately 3m.
Quantitative disclosure about market risk The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value or the fair value of the Groups financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices.
The rates of change chosen reflect the Groups view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period.
Fair values are quoted values or where these are not available values obtained by discounting cash flows at market rates or using option valuation models.
The fair values for interest rate risk are calculated by using a standard zero coupon discounted cash flow pricing model.
Interest rate risk The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 1% move in interest rates of all currencies from their levels at 31 December 2002 with all other variables held constant.

Critical Accounting Policies The Groups main accounting policies are set out on pages 50 and 51 of the consolidated financial statements and conform with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP.
The Group considers the following to be its critical accounting policies under UK
Environmental liabilities With regards to environmental liabilities the Group is subject to obligations and contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in future will or may require it to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior disposal or release of chemical substances by the Group or other parties.
The ultimate requirement for such actions and their cost is inherently difficult to estimate.
Provision for these costs are made when expenditure on remedial work is probable and the cost can be estimated within a reasonable range of possible outcomes.
Processes are in place for regular reviews of environmental liabilities and provisions.
The environmental provisions are detailed in notes 21 and 22 and discussed in note 40 to the consolidated financial statements.
Divestment provisions The divestment provisions have arisen as a result of the reshaping of the Groups portfolio of businesses to focus its resources on paints and specialty products.
The initial determination of the size of these provisions and the subsequent timing and amounts of the expenditure in relation to these provisions is inherently difficult to estimate and therefore requires considerable management judgement.
Provisions were established at the time of each disposal and are regularly reviewed based on latest available facts.
The divestment provisions are set out in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements.
Contingent liabilities The Group is subject to a number of contingent liabilities.
No provision has been made for these contingent liabilities since either the obligations have been evaluated as possible and their existence will be confirmed by uncertain future events or they have not been recognised as either a transfer of economic benefits is not probable or the amount cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.
Details of the Groups contingent liabilities are set out in note 40 to the consolidated financial statements.
Investments
As a result of the transformation programme the Group retains a number of investments.
The recoverability and hence carrying value of these assets requires considerable management judgement.
Currently significant items where management judgement has been used in ascertaining recoverability include the Groups interests in Huntsman International Holdings LLC note 17 and Ineos Chlor notes 3 and 40.
Retirement benefits ICI provides retirement benefits for the majority of its former and current employees through a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution schemes.
These include the ICI UK Pension Fund which is ICIs largest defined benefit schemes and which at 31 December 2002 had liabilities of approximately 6.5bn.
This fund accounts for approximately 87% of the Groups retirement benefit scheme by asset value and in projected benefit terms.
In preparing the Group accounts on the basis of relevant UK accounting standards key assumptions are required in respect of for example rates of inflation increases in earnings member demographics healthcare cost inflation discount rates and returns on investments.
These assumptions are assessed and regularly reviewed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are material items which derive from events or transactions that fall within the ordinary activities of the Group and which individually or if of a similar type in aggregate need to be disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence if the financial statements are to give a true and fair view.
The determination of which items should be separately disclosed as operating exceptional items requires a significant degree of judgement.
The Group considers goodwill to be an additional critical accounting policy under US GAAP
Included within the US GAAP disclosures in note 42 is capitalised goodwill at 31 December 2002 of 3507m.
In the period to 31 December 2002 an impairment of 122m was recognised representing the entire goodwill in the Paints Latin America reporting unit.
Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually using a twostage approach at a reporting unit level.
In the first stage significant management judgement is required to determine the fair value of the reporting unit for example in forecasting the underlying cash flows of the unit in estimating terminal growth values and in selecting an appropriate discount rate.
Where the second stage is performed further management judgement is applied to determine the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit.
If alternative management judgements were adopted in implementing this impairment exercise then different outcomes could be arrived at including potentially a larger impairment charge.
New Accounting Standards UK Accounting Standard FRS No.17 Retirement Benefits which will affect future consolidated financial statements and its impacts are discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements it will not have an impact on cash flows.
New US Standards are outlined in note 42.
Related party transactions The main related party transactions are with Irish Fertilizer Industries Ltd Huntsman International Holdings LLC and IC Insurance Ltd details are in note 41 to the consolidated financial statements.
ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS AND FORM 20F 2002 US GAAP results Under US GAAP the net income in 2002 was 9m 2001 13m net income 2000 456m net loss compared with net income of 179m 2001 80m net income 2000 207m net loss under UK GAAP.
Under US GAAP shareholders equity at 31 December 2002 was 2805m at 31 December 2001 was 2568m and at 31 December 2000 was 2828m compared to 499m surplus and 364m deficit and 249m deficit respectively under UK GAAP.
These differences primarily result from the differing accounting treatment of purchase accounting adjustments pensions disposal accounting capitalisation of interest foreign exchange derivative instruments and restructuring costs.

Review of 2002 business results Review of 2002 business results National Starch National Starchs sales of 1841m were 2% ahead of 2001 and trading profit of 224m was 5% ahead both on a comparable basis.
The growth in sales and profitability reflected both the modest recovery in economic conditions in North America in comparison to 2001 and continued growth from the Asian businesses.
Investment in restructuring announced during 2001 improved the competitiveness and profitability of the Specialty Polymer and Adhesive businesses in both the US and Europe.
Foreign exchange translation effects accounted for the difference between comparable and as reported results with sales and trading profit as reported 1% lower and 3% higher than 2001 respectively.
The following commentary on the four business groupings within National Starch refers to performance measured on a comparable basis.
Adhesives
Adhesives sales were 1% ahead of 2001 and trading profit was also ahead as gross margin percentages improved partly due to lower raw material costs throughout most of the year.
The business also benefited from savings from the 2001 restructuring programme.
Growth within Asia was strongest in China Indonesia Malaysia and India offsetting weakness in Japan where economic conditions continued to be difficult.
In the United States business performance improved in the second half of the year although full year sales remained slightly behind.
In Europe sales were slightly ahead for the year with a strong second half performance stemming from new contract wins.
During the year a new manufacturing facility was opened in Shanghai China.
Starch
Sales for Starch were 4% ahead of 2001 while trading profit was lower largely due to lower profits in the United States.
Sales growth in Asia was strong particularly in food starch although higher raw material costs lowered gross margin percentages during the middle of the year.
In the United States sales mix was poor with growth in commodity food starches outpacing growth in specialty food starch.
Papermaking starch sales in North America improved in the second half following new business wins in both the United States and
However with average corn costs for the year higher than 2001 and fixed costs also higher trading profit in North America was lower.
In Europe sales and trading profit in both food and papermaking were ahead for the year.
Specialty Synthetic Polymers Specialty Synthetic Polymers sales were 2% ahead of 2001 and with the benefits from the 2001 restructuring programme and lower raw material costs trading profit was well ahead of 2001.
The Personal Care polymers business introduced a number of new products during the year helping it to deliver another year of growth.
Alco Chemical performed strongly during the year particularly in sales of its low molecular weight polymers to the water treatment industry in the United States.
The Elotex redispersible powders business also performed well and delivered its strongest growth in the United States and from expansion into Eastern Europe and Asia.
The Vinamul emulsion polymer business achieved strong profit growth due to good fixed cost control and lower average raw material prices albeit from lower overall sales.
Electronic and Engineering Materials Electronic and Engineering Material sales were 6% ahead a modest recovery from a weak 2001.
Sales were relatively strong in the second quarter and towards the end of the year but uncertainty in the electronics and telecommunications markets meant that there was no sustained recovery during 2002.
Trading profit was ahead of 2001 despite increased fixed costs mainly on sales and research resources to support future growth.
Ablestik delivered good growth in the semiconductor materials market and Emerson and Cuming also delivered sales growth particularly from strong sales in ink jet materials.
Acheson sales were ahead for the year primarily as a result of growth in its process lubricants business.
Quest
Quest delivered sales of 716m 1% ahead of 2001 on a comparable basis with good overall growth in North America and Asia offsetting lower Food sales in Europe and Fragrance sales in Latin America.
Food delivered 2% sales growth whilst Fragrance sales were 1% lower.
Overall gross margin percentages were in line with 2001 with favourable product mix offset by tolling costs and adverse exchange rate movements.
However with an estimated 17m impact from production issues arising from second quarter systems changes in a foods factory in the Netherlands trading profit of 82m was 23% lower on a comparable basis.
As reported sales and trading profit were 2% and 23% lower respectively with the effect of foreign exchange translation accounting for the difference from the comparable sales performance.
During the year Quest continued to implement the major programme announced in 2001 to rationalise its cost base and upgrade its business systems.

America 43% National Starch  turnover by customer location in 2002 UK 5%
America 5%
Turnover Trading profit 65telFragrance Fragrance comparable sales were 1% lower in a difficult market partly due to economic slowdown in Latin America combined with a general market slowdown in fine fragrance retail sales throughout the year.
However the introduction of new products resulted in strong performances in Quests fine fragrance and personal care businesses which largely compensated for more difficult conditions in aroma chemicals and other segments.
Consequently the improved sales mix and benefits from supply chain efficiencies contributed positively but with adverse foreign currency movements and increased fixed costs to support future growth trading profit was below 2001.
Food
Food had a difficult year but still delivered 2% comparable sales growth with particularly strong sales performances for both flavours and food ingredients in Asia and in North America.
Sales in Europe were lower.
Gross margin percentages and fixed costs were both negatively impacted by the second quarter ERP implementation issues in the Netherlands and consequently trading profit was well below 2001.
Performance Specialties The reported sales and trading profit for Performance Specialties for 2002 reflect the effects of the divestment of the Synetix and Security Systems businesses during the year.
Security Systems was sold to Lincolnshire Management Inc.
Johnson Matthey plc for 260m in the fourth quarter of 2002.
As reported sales of 804m and trading profit of 49m were 3% and 28% below 2001 respectively.
Uniqema
Uniqema had a difficult year sales of 669m were 2% ahead of 2001 on a comparable basis but trading profit of 28m was 24% lower.
The business experienced significant pressures on gross margin percentages mainly as a result of weaker sales mix in fatty acids and increases in raw material costs.
Market prices of glycerine a major byproduct from Uniqema processes fell in the first quarter but showed no further year on year weakness in subsequent quarters.
Lubricants and Personal Care delivered good comparable sales growth in 2002 9% and 4% respectively.
Lubricants sales were driven by strong demand in the industrial sector in Europe and the compressor sector in North America.
Personal Care grew in all regions and particularly in China and Korea while sales of new skincare products also increased.
The 2001 programme of restructuring and efficiency improvements is on track to deliver full cost savings and working capital reductions by 2004.
In 2002 Uniqema closed its offices at Everberg in Belgium and successfully completed the implementation of new ERP computer systems at all sites in Europe.

Gross margins were above 2001 due to improved sales mix and trading profit was consequently up.
Paints
For 2002 Paints delivered sales of 2182m and achieved comparable sales growth of 1% despite the economic difficulties in Latin America where sales were down 24%.
Performance in Asia was excellent with doubledigit sales and trading profit growth.
Trading profit for Paints of 188m was 9% ahead on a comparable basis with a trading loss in Latin America more than offset by profit growth in other regions.
As reported sales were 2% below 2001 and as reported trading profit 7% ahead with foreign exchange effects accounting for the difference from the comparable performance.
The following commentary on the four geographical regions where Paints operates refers to performance measured on a comparable basis.
In Europe sales were 3% ahead with particularly good performances in the UK retail and trade markets during the second half of the year.
There was also strong growth in the businesses in France and Poland offsetting lower sales in Germany where a slow economy affected business.
Trading profit was ahead for the year with sales growth and lower raw materials costs offsetting weaker sales mix and higher fixed costs.
In North America sales were 1% ahead of 2001.
Sales growth in the US domestic housing and Canadian markets was partially offset by lower sales in the US nonresidential construction sector.
Trading profit for the North American business as a whole was significantly up aided by benefits from the 2001 restructuring programme.
Sales growth in Asia exceeded 10% for the second year in succession with strength in India China Thailand and Indonesia being partially offset by Singapore and Taiwan.
Strong sales and lower raw material costs combined to deliver trading profit well ahead of 2001.
Latin America had a significant negative impact on Paints overall sales and profit growth for the year.
The major devaluation in the Argentinean Peso during the first quarter was followed by devaluations in the other currencies in the region and a slowdown in economic activity.
As a result sales declined from 2001 by 24% in US terms and this together with the higher cost of imported raw materials from the currency devaluation resulted in a trading loss for the year.
The Packaging business delivered comparable sales growth of 1% but trading profit was lower mainly due to weaker sales mix.
Regional and Industrial Regional and Industrial sales for 2002 at 615m were 25% below 2001 mainly due to divested businesses and a reduction in nil margin sales from 275m in 2001 to 209m in 2002.
2001 sales included sales of methanol under a tolling agreement which ceased in April 2001 and supply contracts involving businesses that have been divested.
Higher profits from Pakistan and Argentina were offset by the loss of profits from divested businesses and the impact of a 5m provision in relation to a continuing European court case involving ICIs former Soda Ash business.
Consequently the Regional and Industrial business recorded a trading loss of 10m 14m lower than 2001.
Pakistan
The world and Asian PTA markets experienced significant price fluctuation during the year with markets improving rapidly during the middle of the year but falling away towards the end of the year as new capacity came on stream in Asia.
The PTA business delivered a satisfactory trading performance for the year.
Sales and trading profit were lower in polyester fibre although the Soda Ash business continued to perform well.
Overall trading profit in Pakistan was above 2001.
India
Trading profit for the regional businesses in India was below 2001 mainly due to the divestment of the pharmaceuticals business during the period.
The explosives and nitrocellulose businesses continued to perform well.
Argentina
Whilst sales in Argentina for 2002 were below 2001 due to the effect of the Peso devaluation trading profit improved as the wine chemicals and performance chemicals businesses benefited from significant hard currency exports.
Discontinued operations No businesses became discontinued in 2002.
Paints millions Turnover Trading profit
Europe 16%
Pacific 12% Paints  turnover by customer location in 2002 UK 18%
America 7% Other 1%
America 46% Review of 2001 business results Continuing operations National Starch National Starchs sales in 2001 of 1853m were 4% behind 2000 with trading profit of 218m 12% lower for the same period both on a comparable basis.
Both sales and profit declines reflected the effects of the continued economic downturn in the US and the sharp downturn in the electronics industry which impacted from early in 2001.
However profit improvement programmes including an 8% reduction in headcount during 2001 reduced the rate of profit decline versus 2000 to only 3% for the second half and improved trading margins compared with the first half of 2001.
In the fourth quarter of 2001 a restructuring programme was announced that intended to further reduce the cost base and improve competitiveness.
In total 37m was intended to be spent on restructuring programmes over 2002 and 2003 which included the closure or sale of several sites in the US Europe Asia and Australasia and a further significant headcount reduction.
The programme was focused on Specialty Polymers and Adhesives in North America and Europe.
Foreign exchange translation effects largely accounted for the difference between comparable and as reported performance in 2001 with as reported sales and trading profits 2% and 11% lower than 2000 respectively.
The following commentary on the four business groupings within National Starch refers to performance measured on a comparable basis.
Adhesives
Adhesives sales in 2001 were 3% behind 2000 and trading profit was also lower as good performances in Europe and Asia were offset by the impact of the economic downturn in the US.
In the US price increases and aggressive cost control efforts partially offset lower sales volumes while the European business was more robust recovering from a slow start to deliver both sales and profit growth for the full year.
The Asia Pacific region continued to be a strong performer.
While the downturn in Japan had a significant impact growth continued in other parts of Asia most notably in China and in the DongsungNSC business.
During 2001 DongsungNSC expanded its shoe adhesives business into Vietnam and Mexico.
Starch
Sales for Starch were slightly below 2000 and trading profit also declined as Food Starch growth was more than offset by the decline in the papermaking sector in North America.
Food Starch sales were strong in all regions including North America with its focus on customer needs through technology application continuing to distinguish this business from its competitors.
Tapiocabased starch products produced in Thailand maintained their sales growth both in Asia and in other regions of the world but margins were squeezed by higher tapioca costs especially in the latter part of 2001.
The papermaking starch business which was under severe pressure in North America continued to grow in Asia.
Specialty Synthetic Polymers Specialty Synthetic Polymers sales for 2001 were 2% below 2000.
Margins were impacted early in the year by high raw material costs but improved as the year progressed as a result of aggressive cost reduction efforts and more favourable raw material costs.
Trading profit in 2001 was well ahead of the previous year.
The Vinamul polymers business experienced lower demand in many applications and pressure on pricing remained strong.
Alco Chemical which supplies low molecular weight chemistries for water treatment and other applications continued its strong growth in North America and sustained its expansion in Europe and Asia.
The Elotex powders business suffered from lower sales due to the decline in construction in Western Europe especially Germany and from high raw material costs early in the year.
The personal care business continued to progress in 2001 with broad geographic sales growth building on the recovery of sales that commenced in the second half 2000.
Electronic and Engineering Materials Electronic and Engineering Materials in 2001 suffered from the effects of a major downturn in the semiconductor and electronics industry and as a result sales for that year were 13% below 2000.
Ablestik which supplies materials for semiconductor packaging and micro electronic assemblies was most severely impacted by this downturn but continued to work closely with customers throughout the period and is expected by Group management to be well positioned to benefit from a future upturn in this sector.
Acheson sales of coatings for cathode ray tubes slowed reflecting sluggish demand for computer monitors and television sets.
Emerson and Cuming was also affected by the downturn although it was able to maintain its strong relationships with key ink jet customers while the Circuit Assembly Materials business unit developed significant new business in the aerospace sector particularly within satellite components.
Costs were reduced throughout the division to offset the industry slowdown and despite the decline in sales the division generated a positive trading profit.
Quest
Quest delivered sales of 727m 3% growth in 2001 on a comparable basis with high single digit growth outside Europe and North America.
Improvements in Fragrance offset an adverse sales mix in Food and trading profit of 107m was in line with 2000 on a comparable basis.
As reported sales were up 6% and trading profit up 4% with the effect of foreign exchange 2% and the Quest India acquisition 1% sales and 2% trading profit accounting for the improvement over comparable performance.
During 2001 Quest initiated a major programme to rationalise its cost base through the closure of surplus manufacturing sites restructuring and redesign of the supply chain and the streamlining of management and support services.
In addition business systems processes and capabilities will be upgraded in order to drive supply chain improvements significantly enhance customer service levels and create econnectivity.
The estimated total exceptional cash expenditure of 41m was expected to be incurred within the period 2002 to 2004.
During 2001 ICI mainly via ICI India acquired a 51% stake in Quest India from Hindustan Lever Limited for 33m.
Fragrance
Fragrance had a strong year in 2001 with 5% comparable sales growth despite more difficult market conditions in the second half of the year.
The introduction of new products most notably in personal care contributed to the growth with higher sales also achieved in fragrance ingredients.
Fine fragrance sales were up significantly in the first half of the year but slowed in the second half reflecting the market downturn.
Improved sales mix and supply chain improvements contributed to improved gross margin percentages and as a result trading profit was well ahead for the year.
Trading profit growth was achieved in all the major regions.
ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS AND FORM 20F 2002 Review of 2001 business results operating and financial review 31
Food had a more difficult year in 2001 but comparable sales grew by 2%.
Food ingredients grew particularly in Asia Pacific while Flavours did well in North America and there was continued strong sales growth with most key customers.
Flavour sales were slower in Europe.
Culinary sales were lower but this was offset in particular by strong growth in snacks and dairy.
The associated adverse sales mix effects and higher raw material prices partially offset by cost containment programmes during the year caused trading profits to be lower than in 2000.
Performance Specialties Overall 2001 was a disappointing year for Performance Specialties with sales of 832m 2% lower on a comparable basis and trading profit of 68m 10% lower on a comparable basis.
The extent of the profit decline was however considerably limited by cost saving initiatives in Uniqema.
As reported sales were 1% lower with foreign exchange effects partially offsetting the 2% lower comparable performance.
As reported profits 9% lower were similarly affected.
Uniqema
Uniqema experienced the effects of the global economic downturn particularly in industrial sectors in North America.
These were heightened by the impact of significantly lower glycerine prices after the first quarter particularly in Europe and North America which reduced profits by some 8.5m worldwide.
Sales were down 5% on a comparable basis although the Health and Personal Care business continued to grow.
Overall comparable fixed costs were 3% below 2000 levels with reductions taking effect in the second half but the savings were insufficient to make up for the sales shortfall and profits were well down on the previous year.
Demand in the process intermediates sector remained strong in Europe in the first half of the year but weakened somewhat in the second half.
Market conditions in the US were difficult throughout 2001.
Synthetic lubricants showed strong volume growth year on year despite competitive pressures but the polymers sector slowed with industrial markets generally particularly in Europe in the second half of the year.
As announced in November 2001 Uniqema in Europe is implementing programmes to improve supply chain efficiencies and undertake site restructuring at an estimated cash expenditure of 25m.
In July 2001 Uniqema also completed the sale of its ester manufacturing plant at Baleycourt France to Ineos Chlor.
Synetix
Synetix had an excellent year in 2001.
Higher sales and improved gross margins delivered significant trading profit growth and the total business sales were ahead by 13% on a comparable basis.
In January 2001 Synetix completed the acquisition of the CelActiv catalyst business from Celanese Chemicals Europe GmbH and this business has performed well since acquisition.
Other Specialty Businesses Within other businesses Security Systems increased its sales and profits in 2001.
Paints

Performance in Asia was excellent with 11% comparable sales growth and trading profit well ahead over prior year.
Trading profit for Paints of 176m was up 1% on 2000 on a comparable basis with a halving of trading profits in Latin America more than offset by profit growth in all other regions.
As reported sales were up 4% with foreign exchange effects 3% less divestments 2% and acquisitions 1% accounting for the differences from the comparable performance.
Trading profits as reported were 1% lower with divestment effects 1% and acquisition effects 1% accounting for the differences from the comparable performance.
The worldwide spend on media and publicity for the year was up 3%.
The following commentary on the four geographical regions where Paints operates refers to performance measured on a comparable basis.
In Europe sales were 1% ahead in a slowing European economy with growth in the UK France and Ireland offsetting lower sales in
Trading profits were also ahead as a result of both the growth in sales and the benefits of successful restructuring in France.
In North America the business delivered sales growth of 5% with the US Consumer business doing well and sales from the businesss US Stores returning to modest levels of growth towards the end of 2001.
The business was significantly impacted in the shortterm by events of September 11th but recovered early in the fourth quarter.
Profits for the year were ahead of 2000.
During the fourth quarter the next phase of restructuring the North American Decorative business was announced.

In some cases the level of incentive payments additionally reflects delivery against key strategic objectives to strengthen individual businesses and the balance sheet of ICI.

ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS AND FORM 20F 2002 Performance Growth Plan The Performance Growth Plan PGP drives and rewards longerterm business performance improvement.
The Plan strengthens the alignment with shareholders by placing a greater emphasis on sustained longterm value creation.
For the Executive Directors the Plan makes conditional awards of ICI shares linked to performance over a fixed three year period measured as follows for the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer the number of shares earned under the PGP will depend wholly on how the Total Shareholder Return TSR for ICI compares with the TSR of each of the companies in ICIs Peer Group over the performance period see across.
TSR is the change in the Companys share price plus reinvested dividends for the other Executive Directors who are responsible for the performance of ICIs International Businesses reward will also be based on the performance of their own areas of responsibility 50% of their award will depend on the Economic Profit performance over three years of the business for which the Executive Director is responsible and the other 50% of their award will be based on the relative TSR performance of the Company in addition the Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that the underlying performance of ICI justifies the receipt of any shares.
TSR has been selected as a performance condition to align the interests of Executive Directors and shareholders.
It rewards the relative outperformance of ICI versus its global competitors.
TSR calculations are performed independently by Mercer Human Resource Consulting and are approved by the Remuneration Committee.
For those Directors accountable for the International Businesses Economic Profit is critical as a measure of profitable growth and efficient use of capital to generate sustainable shareholder value.
The shares required to make awards under this Plan are provided via a trust funded by ICI.
There is no dilution of ICIs issued share capital.
The maximum conditional award is 100% of base salary per annum 200% in the case of US Directors.
For the maximum awards to be paid on the TSR element performance must be at least upper quartile versus the Peer Group.
For achieving median TSR performance 40% of this maximum award will be paid and no award will be paid for below median performance.
The targets which relate to Economic Profit growth are set at a level consistent with achieving the Companys TSR goals and ICIs strategic targets.
The Peer Group for the TSR element represents ICIs key global competitors and has been selected on the basis of market location size diversity and performance.
The Peer Group of companies for the conditional awards made in 2002 was Air Products and Chemicals Akzo Nobel Clariant Crompton Corporation Cytec Industries Ciba Specialty Chemicals Danisco Degussa Engelhard Corporation Givaudan Henkel H.
Fuller Company International Flavors and Fragrances Rhodia Rohm and Haas Company The SherwinWilliams
The Peer Group for the 2003 awards will comprise a similar set of companies.
For the 2000  2002 performance period ICIs TSR ranked 13 out of the 17 companies in the Peer Group and as a result all awards under the TSR performance measure for this cycle lapsed.
Two Directors received awards under the Economic Profit measure and these are shown on page 41.
Details of the Ordinary Shares of the Company conditionally awarded to Executive Directors under the Performance Growth Plan and outstanding at 31 December 2002 are shown in the table below.
Target Setting Process ICIs financial objectives derive from a combination of top down goals set by market expectations and a biennial strategic planning process.
These strategic financial objectives then form the basis of all financial targets set under the PGP.

4 The number of shares comprising the awards is determined by the average share price of ICI Ordinary Shares for the month of December prior to the commencement of the performance period.
In the case of the grant made on 28 March 2002 the December average share price was adjusted for the effect of the Rights Issue.
However in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Company is required to state the market price of its shares on the date of the award and these were as follows 25 May 2000 5.24 5 March 2001 5.33 and 28 March 2002 3.42.
Prices for 2000 and 2001 are not adjusted for the impact of the Rights Issue.

Source Thompson Financial Datastream remuneration report ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS AND FORM 20F 2002 Share option schemes audited The share option schemes reward Executive Directors for longerterm corporate performance as reflected in share price appreciation.
Options to purchase the Companys Ordinary Shares may be granted each year.
Individual option grants to Executive Directors during 2002 were in a range of 125% to 200% of salary reflecting market practice UK or US as appropriate and individual performance and potential impact on longerterm business results.
Grants are made subject to a performance condition that over a three year period in the life of the option the growth in ICIs earnings per share excluding both amortisation of goodwill and exceptional items must be equal to or greater than the increase in the UK Retail Prices Index plus 3% per annum.
In the light of the Companys current business outlook and the quantum of the grants involved the Remuneration Committee considers this to be an appropriately challenging condition for option grants made in 2002.
Options must be held for a minimum of three years from grant before they can be exercised and lapse if not exercised within ten years.
The shares to meet rights granted do not dilute ICIs issued share capital as they are bought in the market.
In the USA grants are made as stock appreciation rights SARs and on exercise the gain is delivered in the form of American Depositary Receipts ADRs.
Each ADR represents four ICI Ordinary Shares.
The grants are subject to similar rules.
No gains were realised on the exercise of share options during 2002 or 2001.

The
Register of Directors Interests which is open to inspection by shareholders contains full details of Directors shareholdings and options to subscribe for shares.
4 NonExecutive Directors are not eligible for share option grants.
5 In accordance with the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority the 1999 annual grant of share options to Executive Directors and certain individuals involved with the proposed disposal of businesses to Huntsman ICI Holdings LLC was delayed.
As a result of this delay those participants were granted fewer options at a higher exercise price than would have been the case had the grants been made to them at the same time as they were made to all other participants at an exercise price of 4.333 adjusted for the Rights Issue.
The Remuneration Committee decided that those individuals so affected should receive the same gross gain at the time they exercise their options as if the grant had not been delayed.
6 Mr W H Powells options are awarded in the form of SARs denominated in ADRs but for the purpose of this table have been disclosed in terms of Ordinary Share option equivalents.
7 Since 1998 grants under share option schemes have been made subject to the earnings per share performance condition outlined on page 42.
8 During the period 1 January 2003 to 10 February 2003 there were no changes in the interests of Directors in options.
9 No amount was paid for the award of any options.

ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS AND FORM 20F 2002 Retirement benefits ICI provides retirement benefit plans for its executives which take account of local practice in the countries in which it operates.
These plans are designed as part of the total remuneration package to attract the quality of staff needed by the business and to aid mobility between countries where necessary.
In keeping with the Groups philosophy on fixed elements of reward they are normally positioned around the median of the local market.
Except where Defined Benefit plans already exist for current executives retirement benefits are provided on a defined contribution basis so that Company costs are stable and predictable.
Where possible plans provide flexibility and choice to increase employee commitment and enable executives to make their own contributions as well as the Company.
In this way ICI encourages and supports its executives to play an active role in planning for their individual retirement needs.
It is ICIs policy to match retirement benefit liabilities where possible by external funds rather than by Group assets.
Details of the accrued pension to which each Director is entitled on leaving service and the transfer value of those accrued pensions are shown in the table below.
A transfer value is the present value lump sum equivalent of the accrued pension and is calculated in accordance with the Guidance Note published by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries GN 11.

They also take into account changes in the actuarial assumptions particularly those related to equity and bond returns.
As a result changes in transfer values may be positive or negative depending on investment conditions.
4 Dr B R ONeill participates in the ICI Pension Fund in respect of salary up to the Inland Revenue earnings cap currently 97200 for 20023.

7 Mr W H Powell participates in the National Starch and Chemical Company Pension Plan for Salaried Employees and the Supplementary Retirement and Savings Plan of National Starch and Chemical Company.
Under these Plans pension is based on average pay including annual bonus during the previous five years during which time Mr Powell was promoted to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of National Starch and Chemical Company.
He also participates in two defined contribution plans for which the employers contributions are set out above.
8 No Director received an enhancement to his contractual pension benefit during the year.

6 Certain Executive Directors have a contingent interest in matched shares under the Bonus Conversion Plan provided in respect of the 1999 bonuses which was operated for the last time in respect of that financial year  as described in note 3 to the Directors emoluments table on page 39.

After three years shares purchased in the plan are released and matched by an equal number of shares by the Company provided the individual remains employed by ICI.
During the period 1 January 2003 to 10 February 2003 there were no changes in the interests of Directors in shares.

The following paragraphs describe the main accounting policies.
The accounting policies of some overseas subsidiaries do not conform with UK Accounting Standards and where appropriate adjustments are made on consolidation in order to present the Group financial statements on a consistent basis.
Note 42 describes the significant differences between UK GAAP and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principals US GAAP and presents a reconciliation of net income and shareholders equity from UK GAAP to US GAAP as a result of each difference.
Turnover
Turnover excludes IntraGroup sales and value added taxes.
Revenue is recognised at the point at which title passes.
Depreciation
The Groups policy is to writeoff the book value of each tangible fixed asset excluding land to its residual value evenly over its estimated remaining life.
Reviews are made annually of the estimated remaining lives of individual productive assets taking account of commercial and technological obsolescence as well as normal wear and tear.
Under this policy it becomes impracticable to calculate average asset lives exactly however the total lives approximate to 35 years for buildings and 14 years for plant and equipment.
Depreciation of assets qualifying for grants is calculated on their full cost.
No depreciation has been provided on land.
Pension costs The pension costs relating to Group retirement plans are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries.
The amounts so determined include the regular cost of providing the benefits under the plans which should be a level percentage of current and expected future earnings of the employees covered under the plans.
Variations from the regular pension cost are spread on a systematic basis over the estimated average remaining service lives of current employees in the plans.
Research and development Research and development expenditure is charged to profit in the year in which it is incurred.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are material items which derive from events or transactions that fall within the ordinary activities of the Group and which individually or if of a similar type in aggregate need to be disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence if the financial statements are to give a true and fair view.
Foreign currencies Profit and loss accounts in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at average rates for the relevant accounting periods.
Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates ruling at the date of the Group balance sheet.
Exchange differences on shortterm foreign currency borrowings and deposits are included with net interest payable.
Exchange differences on all other balances except relevant foreign currency loans are taken to trading profit.
In the Group accounts exchange differences arising on consolidation of the net investments in overseas subsidiary undertakings and associates are taken to reserves as are differences arising on equity investments denominated in foreign currencies in the Company accounts.
Differences on relevant foreign currency loans are taken to reserves and offset against the differences on net investments in both Group and Company accounts.
Financial derivatives Hedge accounting The Group uses various derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risks.
These include currency swaps forward currency contracts and currency options.
The Group also uses interest rate swaps forward rate agreements and interest rate caps derivatives to adjust interest rate exposures.
The Group considers its derivative financial instruments to be hedges i. are met.
Under hedge accounting for currency options the Group defers the instruments impact on profit until it recognises the underlying hedged item in profit.
Other material instruments do not involve deferral since the profit impact they offset occurs during the terms of the contracts.
Foreign currency derivative instruments The Groups criteria to qualify for hedge accounting are The instrument must be related to a foreign currency asset or liability that is probable and whose characteristics have been identified It must involve the same currency as the hedged item and It must reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange movements on the Groups operations.
Interest rate derivative instruments The Groups criteria to qualify for hedge accounting are The instrument must be related to an asset or a liability and It must change the character of the interest rate by converting a variable rate to a fixed rate or vice versa.
Derivative financial instruments reported in the financial statements The unamortised premium paid on purchased currency options is included in debtors in the balance sheet.
Cash flows related to foreign currency derivative transactions are reported along with related transactions in net cash inflow from operating activities or returns on investments and servicing of finance as appropriate in the Statement of Group cash flow.
Currency swaps Principal amounts are revalued at exchange rates ruling at the date of the Group balance sheet and included in the sterling value of loans.
In accordance with SSAP20 and FRS 3 exchange gainslosses are included in the Statement of Group total recognised gains and losses along with similar movements in the values of the investments being hedged.
Forward currency contracts Those forward currency contracts hedging transaction exposures purchases and sales held in the books of account are revalued to balance sheet rates with net unrealised gainslosses being shown as debtorscreditors.
Both realised gains and losses on purchasessales and unrealised gainslosses on forward contracts are recognised in trading profit.
Financial derivatives continued Forward currency contracts continued Those contracts used to change the currency mix of net debt are revalued to balance sheet rates with net unrealised gainslosses being shown as part of the debt they are hedging.
The difference between spot and forward rate for these contracts is recognised as part of net interest payable over the period of the contract.
Realised and unrealised exchange gainslosses are shown in the financial statements in the same place as the underlying borrowingdeposit.
Currency options Option premia are recognised at their historic cost in the Group balance sheet as other debtors.
At maturity the option premia net of any realised gains on exercise are taken to the financial statements as trading profit.
Interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements Interest paymentsreceipts are accrued with net interest payable.
They are not revalued to fair value or shown on the Group balance sheet at period end.
If they are terminated early the gain or loss is spread over the remaining maturity of the original instrument.
Interest rate caps The option premia are recognised on the Group balance sheet as other debtors.
The option premia net of any realised gains on individual caplets are taken to net interest payable and spread evenly over the lifetime of the cap.
Associates
Associates are undertakings in which the Group holds a longterm interest and over which it actually exercises significant influence.
The
Groups share of the profits less losses from associates are included in the Group profit and loss account on the equity accounting basis.
The holding value of associates in the Group balance sheet is calculated by reference to the Groups equity in the net assets of such undertakings as shown by the most recent accounts available.
Interests in joint arrangements that are not entities are included proportionately in the accounts of the investing entity.
Investments
Investments are held at cost less provisions for impairment.
Taxation
Full provision for deferred tax is made for timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in the consolidated financial statements and their recognition in the tax computation using current tax rates except as otherwise required by FRS 19.
The Group does not discount these balances.
No deferred tax is provided in respect of any future remittance of earnings of foreign subsidiaries or associates where no commitment has been made to remit such earnings.
Taxation on exchange differences on relevant foreign currency loans used to finance net investments in subsidiary undertakings and associates is taken to reserves to be consistent with the treatment of the underlying exchange differences on the loans and net investments.
Stock valuation Finished goods are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value raw materials and other stocks at the lower of cost and net realisable value the first in first out or an average method of valuation is used.
In determining cost for stock valuation purposes depreciation is included but selling expenses and certain overhead expenses are excluded.
Environmental liabilities The Group is exposed to environmental liabilities relating primarily to its past operations principally in respect of soil and groundwater remediation costs.
Provisions for these costs are made when expenditure on remedial work is probable and the cost can be estimated within a reasonable range of possible outcomes.
Goodwill
On the acquisition of a business fair values are attributed to the net assets acquired.
Goodwill arises where the fair value of the consideration given for a business exceeds the fair value of such net assets.
For purchased goodwill arising on acquisitions after 31 December 1997 goodwill is capitalised and amortised through the profit and loss account over a period of 20 years unless the Directors consider it has a materially different useful life either on acquisition or subsequently if a shorter life is indicated.
For goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 31 December 1997 purchased goodwill was charged directly to reserves in the year of acquisition.
On subsequent disposal or termination of a previously acquired business the profit or loss recognised on disposal or termination is calculated after charging the amount of any related goodwill previously taken to reserves.
Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP The financial statements of the Group include the assets and related liabilities of Imperial Chemical Industries PLC Employee Benefits Trust and Impkemix Trustees Limited a subsidiary company of the Group which acts as trustee for the Groups employee share ownership plan.
The shares held by the ESOP are stated at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value.

17 Retirement benefits This Standard sets out revised requirements for the accounting and disclosure of an employers retirement benefit obligations and related funding.
Increasing levels of disclosure of amounts measured in accordance with the Standard have been required over the years 2001 and 2002 with recognition in the primary statements for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 following suspension by the Accounting Standards Board.
The Group has followed the transitional requirements of the Standard.
In 2001 information on financial assumptions to calculate the projected benefit obligations of Group schemes and details of scheme assets expected rates of return liabilities and net liabilities assets were disclosed in note 37.
In 2002 further analysis covering the amounts to be charged in future years to trading profit other finance income and the Statement of Group total recognised gains and losses is provided in note 37.
Upon full adoption in 2005 comparative financial statement information will be restated.
The requirements of the Standard will have no impact on cash flows.
FRS No.
19 Deferred Tax This Standard requires full provision to be made for deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in the financial statements and their recognition in a tax computation except as otherwise required by FRS No.
It also requires deferred tax assets to be recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
The Standard allows the optional discounting of all or none of the deferred tax assets or liabilities and the Group has elected not to discount.
Prior to the adoption of FRS No.
19 deferred tax was only provided on a partial provision basis.
The standard is implemented in these financial statements and all primary statements and notes relating to the accounts have been restated.
Compliance with FRS No.
19 has increased the 2001 deferred tax provision by 81m 2000 33m.
The tax charge on profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items has increased by 27m in 2001 2000 34m resulting in a restated effective tax rate for 2001 of 28.9% 2000 31.6% compared with 22.2% 2000 24.0% originally reported.
The net profit for 2001 decreased by 41m 2000 increase 21m.
The estimated impact on the current years profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items if FRS No.
19 had not been adopted would be to reduce the underlying effective tax rate from 29% to approximately 22%.
The impact on profit before tax has not been quantified as it is impractical to do so.
The new standard has no impact on cash flows.
Both FRS No.
17 and FRS No.
19 were published in 2000 since which time no new UK Standards have been published.
Continuing and Discontinued Operations and Classes of Business For UK reporting purposes the results in these accounts differentiate between the Groups continuing and discontinued operations.
As defined in FRS No.
3  Reporting Financial Performance discontinued operations are material clearly separate operations which have been sold or permanently terminated either during the financial year or during the subsequent period up to the date of approval of the financial statements.
All other operations are classified as continuing operations.
Discontinued operations in these financial statements comprise ChlorChemicals Klea and Crosfield businesses Methanol business 50% equity shareholding in PhillipsImperial Petroleum Ltd Where businesses have been reclassified as discontinued operations comparative segmental data has been restated in all cases.
Net interest payable and tax on profit loss on ordinary activities have been allocated to discontinued operations to reflect the legal entity incidence of these items within the business divested.
Non coterminous year ends Owing to local conditions and to avoid undue delay in the presentation of the Group accounts three subsidiaries made up their accounts to dates earlier than 31 December but not earlier than 30 September additionally seven subsidiaries made up their accounts prior to 30 September but interim accounts to 31 December were drawn up for consolidation purposes.
Cash
In the statement of Group cash flow and related notes cash includes cash at bank deposits repayable on demand and overdrafts deposits are repayable on demand if they are in practice available within 24 hours without penalty.
Estimates
The preparation of the Consolidated financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

No taxes have been provided for liabilities which may arise on the distribution of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and associates except where distributions of such profits are planned.
Cumulative unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates totalled approximately 996m at 31 December 2002 2001 887m 2000 828m.
The remittance of these amounts would incur tax at substantially lower than statutory rates after giving effect to foreign tax credits.

Earnings per 1 Ordinary Share before exceptional items have been calculated to show the impact of exceptional items as these can have a distorting effect on earnings and therefore warrant separate consideration.
On 4 February 2002 the Company announced a Rights Issue and following approval of the required resolutions at the subsequent Extraordinary General Meeting 463m new Ordinary Shares were issued at 180p per share on the basis of 7 new Ordinary Shares for every 11 existing Ordinary Shares.
The actual cum rights price on 25 February 2002 the last day of quotation cum rights was 319p per share and the theoretical ex rights price for an ordinary share was therefore 265p per share.
The comparative earnings per share are shown after applying the factor 265319 to the published figures for 2001 and 2000 after adjusting for deferred tax see note 1 in order to adjust for the bonus issue within the Rights Issue.

The management of current asset investments is discussed in note 38.
Huntsman International Holdings LLC Under the terms of a Sale and Purchase Agreement dated 14 June 2002 ICI agreed to sell its interests in Huntsman International Holdings LLC HIH which comprise 1 a holding of subordinated loan notes in HIH HIH Notes and 2 ICI Alta Inc.
Corporation HSCC dated 2 November 2000 the Option Agreement as amended 20 December 2001 to CSFB Global Opportunities Partners L. now Matlin Patterson Global Opportunities Partners L.
The aggregate purchase price is 440m 283m.
Of this amount 160m 109m has been received.
The remaining 280m 174m with an amount equivalent to interest from 15 May 2002 to the date of payment will be payable on 15 May 2003 with the purchaser having the option to pay all or part of the amount due prior to 15 May 2003 by means of instalment payments.
As security for a portion of the outstanding purchase price the HIH Notes have been pledged back to ICI otherwise the agreement is effectively without recourse to Matlin Patterson Global Opportunities Partners L.
This pledge will be released when ICI has received in aggregate at least 260m of the total purchase price.
When ICI has received at least 350m of the total purchase price ICI will release ICI Altas existing pledge over 21% of the 30% equity interest in HIH pledged to ICI by HSCC and reduce the amount due from HSCC to ICI Alta under the Option Agreement by approximately 50%.
If no installment payments are made the Option Agreement will remain in place on its existing terms.
The sale of ICI Alta and the indirect transfer of ICIs 30% equity interest in HIH is permitted by the Option Agreement however due to separate constraints on members of HIH transferring any interests in HIH to third parties the purchaser may be obligated to obtain the written consent of HSCC prior to transfer of ownership of ICI Alta.
Ownership of the HIH Notes has been transferred subject to the pledge arrangements above and ownership of ICI Alta will be transferred when the full purchase price has been received.
The HIH Notes have been accounted for as sold with some of the purchase price outstanding and the equity interest in HIH accounted for as an investment rather than an associate undertaking.
As the transaction has not been completed the estimated net overall gain of approximately 55m has not been recognised.
The outstanding purchase price on the HIH Notes of 100m 62m and the loss on the HIH Notes of approximately 40m together with the equity interest in HIH 23m are held in the Group balance sheet as current asset investments until such time as the total purchase price of 440m 283m has been received in full.
At that date the overall profit on the transaction will be recorded.
Although not expected at this time a failure by Matlin Patterson Global Opportunities Partners L. circumstances then prevailing.
In general HIH is required to make certain distributions in respect of taxes payable by its members tax distributions and may make other distributions upon approval of a majority of its board of directors subject to two restrictions.
First under Delaware law HIH may not make a distribution to its members if after such distribution HIHs liabilities would exceed the fair value of its assets.
Second with certain exceptions including for tax distributions the terms of HIHs outstanding indebtedness which mature in 2009 generally prohibit HIH from making any distributions or payments on or with respect to HIHs equity while such indebtedness is outstanding.

95  Statements of Cash Flows.
The two statements differ however in their definitions of cash and their presentation of the main constituent items of cash flow.
The definition of cash in the UK Standard is limited to cash plus deposits less overdraftsborrowings repayable on demand without penalty.
In the US the definition in SFAS No.
95 excludes overdrafts but is widened to include cash equivalents comprising shortterm highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash and so near their maturities that they present insignificant risk of changes in value generally only investments with original maturities of 3 months or less qualify for inclusion.
Calculated in accordance with SFAS No.
95 cash and cash equivalents at 31 December 2000 2001 and 2002 and the movements during the years ending on those dates were as followstel m m m Cash and cash equivalents Investments and shortterm deposits which were within 3 months of maturity when acquired 15tel436 572 Change in the balance of cash and cash equivalents At beginning of year 436 572 454 Exchange adjustments 12 3 1 Cash inflow outflow during year 2 119 114 Acquisitions and disposals 1 14 3 At end of year 425 436 572 The format of the UK statement employs some nine headings compared with three in SFAS No.

The Company and most of its subsidiaries operate retirement plans which cover the majority of employees including Directors in the Group.
These plans are generally of the defined benefit type under which benefits are based on employees years of service and average final remuneration and are funded through separate trusteeadministered funds.
Formal independent actuarial valuations of the Groups main plans are undertaken regularly normally at least triennially and adopting the projected unit method.
The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the projected benefit obligation of the Groups pension plans vary according to the economic conditions of the country in which they are situated.
The weighted average discount rate used in determining the actuarial present values of the benefit obligations was 6.0% 2001 6.1%.
The weighted average expected longterm rate of return on investments was 6.1% 2001 6.3%.
The weighted average rate of increase of future earnings was 4.0% 2001 4.1%.
The market value of the fund assets of these plans at the date of the latest actuarial valuations was sufficient to cover 99% 2001 99% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings their market value was 7721m 2001 7843m.
The total pension cost for the Group for 2002 was 89m 2001 70m 2000 85m.
Accrued pension costs amounted to 9m 2001 11m and are included in other creditors note 19 provisions for the benefit obligation of a small number of mainly unfunded plans amounted to 148m 2001 179m and are included in provisions for liabilities and charges  pensions note 21.
Prepaid pension costs amounting to 525m 2001 510m are included in debtors note 16.
ICI Pension Fund The ICI Pension Fund accounts for approximately 87% of the Groups plans in asset valuation and projected benefit terms.
From the date of the actuarial valuation of the ICI Pension Fund as at 31 March 1994 the Company has been making payments into the Fund to reflect the extra liabilities arising from early retirement as retirements occur.
Based on a Funding Review as at 31 March 1997 the Company agreed to make six annual payments into the Fund of 100m per annum from 1998 through 2003 subject to a review in 2000.
The latest actuarial valuation of the Fund as at 31 March 2000 disclosed a solvency ratio of 98% and the Company has agreed to make a further six annual payments into the Fund of 30m per annum from 2001 to 2006 subject to a review in 2003.
The deficit together with the prepayment is taken into account in arriving at the employers pension costs charged in the accounts by being amortised as a percentage of pensionable emoluments over the expected working lifetime of existing members.
In 2002 this gave rise to a charge of 16m 2001 13m.
Healthcare UITF Abstract 6 The Group provides in North America and to a lesser extent in some other countries certain unfunded healthcare and life assurance benefits for retired employees.
At 31 December 2002 approximately 20000 2001 20000 current and retired employees were eligible to benefit from these schemes.
The liabilities in respect of these benefits are fully accrued over the expected working lifetime of the existing members.
The total postretirement healthcare cost for the Group for 2002 was 12m 2001 10m 2000 13m and the provision at the year end was 179m 2001 199m.
The Group has adopted the measurement basis of the US Standard SFAS No.106  Employers Accounting for PostRetirement Benefits other than Pensions as the basis of its UK GAAP reporting.
Costs and provisions were determined on an actuarial basis.
The assumptions relating to the US plans which represent a substantial proportion on the Group total are set out in the table on note 42.
The healthcare cost trend has a significant effect on the amounts reported.
For the Group increasing the assumed health care cost rates by 1% in every year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of 31 December 2002 by 11m 2001 8m and the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the year ended 31 December 2002 by 2m 2001 1m.

The figures shown above take into account various interest rate swaps currency swaps and forward exchange contracts used to manage the interest rate and currency profile of financial assets and liabilities.
As explained in the Operating and Financial Review on page 23 the Groups policy is where practicable to hedge all exposures on monetary assets and liabilities.
As a result there are no significant non functional currency exposures.
The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities as defined in section a above at 31 December 2002 was as follows 2002 2001 m m In one year or less 726 1668 In more than one year but not more than two years 548 366 In more than two years but not more than five years 792 860 In more than five years 44 515 2110 3409 101 38 Financial risk management continued d Borrowing facilities Committed facilities available to the Group at 31 December 2002 in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date were as follows 2002 2001 m m Expiring in one year or less 201 512 Expiring in more than one year 883 Expiring in more than two years 425 1232 1509 1744 e Net debt management The Group manages the currency and interest rate exposure which arises on borrowings and cash not immediately required by the business on a net basis through the use of currency swaps forward exchange contracts interest rate swaps and interest rate caps.
The most significant consequences of this approach are to manage the currency exposures arising from loans by holding cash and through currency swaps. to reduce the proportion of the Groups fixed interest rate liabilities arising from loans through the use of fixed to floating rate swaps.
The financial instruments used in debt management are accounted for as described in the Groups accounting policies on pages 50 and 51.
The notional principal amounts and fair values net of associated hedges of the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities were as follows

The fair value of the Groups longterm publicly quoted debt is based upon quoted market prices.
The fair value of the Groups nonpublicly quoted debt all swaps and caps have been estimated from discounted anticipated cash flows utilising a zero coupon yield curve.
The total decrease in the fair value of longterm debt net of associated hedges for the year ended 31 December 2002 of 1067m arose from the net repayment of loans 966m favourable movements on foreign exchange 152m and adverse movements due to changes in interest rates 51m.
A portfolio approach is adopted to create the Groups target proportion of fixed and floating rate debt by currency.
The maturity profile of the net fixed rate exposure is spread over several years to reduce repricing risk.
Short term borrowings include balances relating to forward exchange contracts.
These balances are further analysed in section g.
Where interest rate and currency instruments are designated to a group of borrowings or cash and cash equivalents with similar characteristics altering their interest rate or currency profile the net cash amounts to be received or paid on the agreements are accrued in current assets or liabilities and recognised as an adjustment to interest income or expense accrual accounting.
ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS AND FORM 20F 2002 notes relating to the accounts 38 Financial risk management continued e Net debt management continued The Group is exposed to credit related losses in the event that counterparties to offbalancesheet financial instruments do not perform according to the terms of the contract.
In the opinion of management the counterparties to the financial instruments are creditworthy parties and the Group does not expect any significant loss to result from nonperformance.
The immediate credit exposure of financial instruments is represented by those financial instruments that have a positive fair value at 31 December 2002.
At 31 December 2002 the aggregate value of all financial instruments with a positive fair value assets was 62m for currency swaps 96m for interest rate swaps 12m for forward contracts nil for interest rate caps and 2m for currency options.
There were no net material gains or losses deferred at 31 December 2002 2001 nil.

The Group selectively hedges its anticipated currency cash flow exposures for up to 12 months ahead through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts and selective purchase of currency options.
Surplus funds are invested in instruments in a variety of currencies.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge these back to the currencies that are appropriate for the net debt portfolio.
The financial instruments used in currency management are accounted for as described in the Groups accounting policies on pages 50 and 51.
The notional principal amounts and fair values of forward exchange contracts used in currency management are as follows
At 31 December At 31 December At 31 Decemberteltel m m m m m m Hedging working capital Forward contracts to buy currency 99 86 Forward contracts to sell currency 96 85 Hedging anticipated cash flows Currency contracts to buy currency 97 135 Currency contracts to sell currency 88 133 Hedging debt 4 39 4 32 Forward contracts to buy currency 617 1445 Forward contracts to sell currency 620 1409 liability The carrying values of currency hedging instruments do not materially differ from the fair values based on quoted market prices.
Surplus funds are invested in high quality liquid marketable investments including money market instruments government securities and asset backed securities.
Investments are of a plain vanilla nature with no embedded interest rate options.
The majority of asset backed securities have some risk of early redemption but are of a floating rate nature and hence have minimal fixed interest rate risk.
There are no investments of a fixed rate nature with maturity greater than one year and consequently the fair value of investments is considered to be materially the same as the value in the Groups balance sheet.
Investments are classified as available for sale.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is controlled by setting a policy for limiting credit exposure to counterparties which is reviewed annually and reviewing credit ratings and limiting individual aggregate credit exposures accordingly.
The Group considers the possibility of material loss in the event of nonperformance by a financial counterparty to be unlikely.
The notional amounts of financial instruments used in debt and currency management do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and thus are not a measure of the credit risk to the Group arising through the use of these instruments.
The immediate credit risk of these instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts with a positive fair value.

ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS AND FORM 20F 2002 notes relating to the accounts 40 Commitments and contingent liabilities Group Companytel 2001 m m m m Commitments for capital expenditure not provided for in these accounts including acquisitions Contracts placed for future expenditure Expenditure authorised but not yet contracted Contingent liabilities existed at 31 December 2002 in connection with guarantees and uncalled capital relating to subsidiary and other undertakings and guarantees relating to pension funds including the solvency of pension funds.
There was no contingent liability in respect of guarantees of borrowings and uncalled capital for the Group at 31 December 2002 2001 nil the maximum contingent liability for the Company mainly on guarantees of borrowing by subsidiaries was 1441m 2001 2308m.
The Group is also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require it to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior disposal or release of chemical substances by the Group or other parties.
The ultimate requirement for such actions and their cost is inherently difficult to estimate however provisions have been established at 31 December 2002 in accordance with the Groups accounting policy noted on page It is believed that taking account of these provisions the cost of addressing currently identified environmental obligations is unlikely to impair materially the Groups financial position and results of operations.
The Glidden Company Glidden a wholly owned subsidiary of ICI is a defendant along with former lead paint and pigment producers as well as other lead product manufacturers and their trade associations in a number of suits in the United States.
These suits seek damages for alleged personal injury caused by leadbased paint or the costs of removing leadbased paint.
An alleged predecessor of Glidden manufactured lead pigments until the 1950s and leadbased consumer paint until the 1960s.
Due to the nature of the suits Glidden is unable to quantify the amount being claimed although the suits are likely to involve substantial claims for damages.
The cases presently pending against Glidden include a suit filed in 1989 by the New York City Housing Authority in New York state court seeking the removal of all leadbased paint from two housing projects a purported statewide personal injury class action filed in 1998 on behalf of all lead poisoned children in New York state court a personal injury suit filed in 1999 on behalf of six lead poisoned minors in state court in Maryland and a personal injury action filed in 2002 on behalf of a lead poisoned adult in state court in Mississippi.
Five other individual personal injury actions were filed in 2000 and 2001 against Glidden and other members of the lead industry in Maryland state court however these actions have not been served on any of the defendants and no activity is expected for the foreseeable future.
One additional personal injury action was filed in late 2002 in New York state court but Glidden has not been served in that case.
Glidden has been dismissed from seventeen cases in 2002 and was not named as a defendant in more than two dozen lead paint lawsuits filed this year.
Glidden continues to believe that it has strong defences to all of the pending cases and has denied all liability and will continue to vigorously defend all actions.
ICI Chemicals and Polymers Limited CandP a subsidiary is involved in arbitration proceedings in Singapore regarding PTA technology exchange and licence arrangements with PT Polyprima Karyareksa
Fees due under these arrangements are being claimed against Polyprima who in response has claimed damages totalling up to 130m for alleged breach of contract alleged fraud deceit misrepresentation and concealment allegations which CandP rejects and intends to resist vigorously CandPs claim against Polyprima was heard before an arbitration tribunal in Singapore in May 2002 and the decision of the tribunal is awaited.
The Group is also involved in various other legal proceedings principally in the United Kingdom and United States arising out of the normal course of business.
The Directors do not believe that the outcome of these other proceedings will have a material effect on the Groups financial position.
In recent years the Group has carried out a programme of strategic disposals in the course of which we have given to other parties in these transactions certain indemnities warranties and guarantees including indemnities warranties and guarantees relating to known and potential latent environmental health and safety liabilities.
There are also a number of contracts relating to businesses which we exited as part of our disposal programme which have not been novated to the purchasers of these businesses.
The Groups 50% interest in Teesside Gas Transportation Ltd TGT was sold during 1996 to a subsidiary of its other shareholder Enron Europe Ltd Enron which is currently in administration.
TGT contracted with the owners of a distribution network the CATS parties for pipeline capacity for North Sea gas and the commitment is guaranteed severally on a 5050 basis by the Company and Enron the present value of the commitment guaranteed by the Company is estimated at 163m.
On the sale of the Groups interest in TGT to Enron the Company received the benefit of a counter guarantee from Enrons parent Enron Corp.
Enron Corp. bankruptcy protection in the USA on 2 December 2001.
The Groups interest in Teesside Power Ltd TPL was sold on 31 December 1998 to Enron Teesside Operations Ltd ETOL.
TPL had previously contracted with certain gas sellers for the purchase of gas.
Enron Corp. respectively.
On the sale of the Groups interest in TPL to ETOL the Company received the benefit of a counter indemnity from ETOL and a guarantee from Enron Corp. guarantee commitment to the gas sellers.
As mentioned above Enron has sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the USA.
The present value of this commitment is estimated at 285m.
The subsidiaries from which the Company has indemnities are currently operating.
The numbers quoted above are current estimates of the Companys maximum potential liability.

In connection with the disposal of the Groups ChlorChemicals business to Ineos Chlor Ineos Chlor has made a 65 million claim against the Group relating to expenditure allegedly required in relation to the Runcorn site which the Group is disputing.
As yet legal proceedings have not been commenced by Ineos Chlor but it is possible that they will be in the near future.
Ineos Chlor has also approached the UK Department of Trade and Industry to seek Regional Selective Assistance for certain capital projects and is also seeking financial support from its parent company and the Group.
ICI has received reports that Ineos Chlor may seek to close part or all of its business if this financial support is not forthcoming.
If such a closure was to occur a number of ChlorChemicals contracts in the Groups name which have not yet been novated to Ineos Chlor and certain environmental liabilities could revert to the Group or be accelerated.
In connection with the sale of the ChlorChemicals business the Group agreed to provide or guarantee up to 100m of future financing to Ineos Chlor.
These facilities were available at market related rates for 5 years and may if necessary be extended for a further 2 years.
As at 31 December 2002 Ineos Chlor had borrowed 70 million from the Company under these facilities.
In addition the book value of the PIK notes which the Group received from Ineos Chlor as part of the consideration for the sale was 29 million at 31 December 2002.
Whilst the Group has not waived Ineos Chlors obligations in respect of the loan facility or PIK notes discussions to date with Ineos Chlor indicate that some uncertainty exists as to the extent to which and period over which these amounts will be recovered.
As a result as mentioned in note 3g on page 58 the Group has provided for these amounts.
The loan facilities together with Ineos Chlors obligation to assume various ChlorChemicals contracts are secured in favour of the Group.
While any of these liabilities remain outstanding the Group has certain rights under a shareholders agreement including in the event of an Ineos Chlor default the right for no consideration to take control of Ineos Chlor if the Group judges that it is in its best interests to do so.
The Groups 15% shareholding in Ineos Chlor Limited is subject to put and call options in certain circumstances.
The only significant takeorpay contract entered into by subsidiaries is the purchase of electric power which commenced in the second quarter of 1998 for 15 years.
The present value of this commitment at the year end is estimated at 162m.
The ultimate outcome of the matters described above is subject to many uncertainties including future events and the uncertainties inherent in litigation.
The Group has made provision in its financial statements for such matters to the extent losses are presently considered probable and estimable.
However these matters involve substantial sums and an unfavourable outcome of one or more of these matters could have a material effect on the Groups results of operations liquidity and financial position.
ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS AND FORM 20F 2002 notes relating to the accounts The accompanying Group financial statements included in this report are prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP.
The significant differences between UK GAAP and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles US GAAP which affect the Groups net income and shareholders equity are set out below a Accounting for pension costs There are five significant differences between UK GAAP under SSAP 24 and US GAAP in accounting for pension costs i SFAS No.
87 Employers Accounting for Pensions requires that pension plan assets are valued by reference to their fair or market related values whereas UK GAAP permits an alternative measurement of assets which in the case of the main UK retirement plans is on the basis of the discounted present value of expected future income streams from the pension plan assets. ii SFAS No.
87 requires measurements of plan assets and obligations to be made as at the date of financial statements or a date not more than three months prior to that date.
Under UK GAAP calculations may be based on the results of the latest actuarial valuation. iii SFAS No.
87 mandates a particular actuarial method  the projected unit credit method  and requires that each significant assumption necessary to determine annual pension cost reflects best estimates solely with regard to that individual assumption.
UK
GAAP does not mandate a particular method but requires that the method and assumptions taken as a whole should be compatible and lead to the actuarys best estimate of the cost of providing the benefits promised. iv Under SFAS No.
87 a negative pension cost may arise where a significant unrecognised net asset or gain exists at the time of implementation.
This is required to be amortised on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of employees.
Under UK GAAP the Groups policy is to not recognise pension credits in its financial statements unless a refund of or reduction in contributions is likely. v SFAS No.
88 Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits requires immediate recognition of previously unrecognised gains or losses when certain events meeting the definition of a plan settlement or curtailment occur.
Under UK GAAP such gains or losses are recognised over the expected service life of the remaining employees.
In the Groups financial statements prepared in accordance with UK GAAP goodwill arising on acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method after 1 January 1998 is capitalised and amortised.
Prior to that date such goodwill arising on acquisitions by the Group was and remains eliminated against retained earnings.
Values were not placed on intangible assets.
Additionally UK GAAP requires that on subsequent disposal or closure of a previously acquired asset any goodwill previously taken directly to shareholders equity is then charged in the income statement against the income or loss on disposal or closure.
Prior to the adoption of SFAS No.
142 Goodwill and other Intangible Assets on 1 January 2002 under US GAAP all goodwill was capitalised and amortised through charges against income over its estimated life not exceeding 40 years.
Also under US GAAP it was normal practice to ascribe fair values to identifiable intangibles and for the purpose of the adjustments to US GAAP included in the tables below identifiable intangible assets of the Group were amortised to income over the lower of their estimated lives or 40 years.
Provision under US GAAP was made where there was a permanent impairment to the carrying value of capitalised goodwill and intangible assets based on a projection of future undiscounted cash flows.
The Group adopted the provisions of SFAS No.
142 from 1 January 2002.
The standard requires that intangible assets with finite lives be amortised over their estimated useful lives.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually in lieu of being amortised.
Goodwill is no longer amortised on a straightline basis over its estimated useful life but instead is tested for impairment annually and whenever indicators of impairment arise see section l below.
There is no requirement in the UK to capitalise interest and the Group does not capitalise interest in its Group financial statements.
Under
US GAAP SFAS No.
34 Capitalization of Interest Cost requires interest incurred as part of the cost of constructing fixed assets to be capitalised and amortised over the life of the asset.
In June 1998 the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No.
133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities.
In June 2000 the FASB issued SFAS No.
Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities an Amendment of SFAS No.
SFAS No.
133 and SFAS
138 require that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their respective fair values.
SFAS No.
133 and SFAS
138 are effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after 30 June 2000 the Group adopted SFAS No.
133 and SFAS No.
138 on 1 January 2001.
In accordance with the transition provisions of SFAS No.133 the Group recorded at 1 January 2001 a netoftax cumulativeeffecttype increase of 4m in accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity to recognise at fair value all derivatives that were previously designated as cash flow hedging instruments.
A fair value adjustment increased debt by 35m which was offset by a corresponding amount to record derivatives previously designated as fair value hedging instruments.
All of the transition adjustment that was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income has been reclassified into earnings as of 31 December 2001.
The fair value adjustment to debt is being amortised over the period of the debt in accordance with the transitional rules.
Upon adoption the Groups management decided not to designate any of its derivative instruments as hedges for US GAAP accounting purposes.
Derivatives previously designated as cash flow and fair value hedges are now marked to market.
Consequently the Groups earnings under US GAAP may be more volatile because of the effect of derivative instruments.
Under US GAAP the forward contracts to purchase the Companys Ordinary Shares by the employee share trust in order to hedge obligations in respect of options issued under certain employee share option schemes are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value with changes in the fair value recognised in net income.
42 Differences between UK and US accounting principles 107 42 Differences between UK and US accounting principles continued e Restructuring costs Under UK GAAP provisions are made for restructuring costs once a detailed formal plan is in place and valid expectations have been raised in those affected that the restructuring will be carried out.
Provision is made for voluntary redundancy payments to the extent that it is expected that volunteers will come forward.
US GAAP requires a number of specific criteria be met before restructuring costs can be recognised as an expense.
Among these criteria is the requirement that all significant actions arising from the restructuring plan and their completion dates must be identified by the balance sheet date.
Under US GAAP voluntary severance benefits are accrued when the terms are accepted by the individual employee.
Also to the extent restructuring costs are related to the activities of the acquired company US GAAP allows them to be recognised as a liability upon acquisition provided certain specific criteria are met whereas UK GAAP does not.
Accordingly timing differences arise between the UK GAAP and US GAAP recognition of such costs.
SFAS No. will be adopted from 1 January 2003 see section m below.
Under UK GAAP on the sale of a foreign enterprise cumulative foreign exchange differences within reserves are not considered in arriving at a gain or loss on disposal.
Under US GAAP on the sale of a foreign enterprise the cumulative foreign currency differences within reserves are taken to net income in arriving at the gain or loss on disposal.
Prior to the adoption of SFAS No.
144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets as described below the criteria for treatment of a disposal as a discontinued operation under US GAAP was different from the criteria under UK GAAP.
A description of the UK GAAP criteria and a list of businesses which have been treated as discontinued operations under UK GAAP is included in note 1.
No businesses met the criteria for discontinued operations under US
On 1 January 2002 the Group adopted SFAS No.
SFAS No.
144 requires the disposal of a component of an enterprise meeting certain conditions and which comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished operationally and for financial reporting purposes from the rest of the entity be disclosed as a discontinued operation.
Under US GAAP the Synetix disposal meets these conditions and therefore Synetix is classified as a discontinued operation.
Accordingly under US GAAP the results of the operations and the gain on the disposal of Synetix are classified within discontinued operations.
Prior period results have been restated.
Under US GAAP the gain on sale in 2002 amounted to 107m and Synetix sales were 121m 143m and 125m for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively.
Additionally UK GAAP sets out that for an operation to be treated as discontinued its disposal should have a material effect on the nature and focus of a reporting entitys operations and represent a material reduction in operating facilities.
The Synetix disposal does not meet these requirements and has been classified as continuing under UK GAAP.
In 2000 the Group recorded the disposal of its ChlorChemicals business.
The disposal for UK financial reporting purposes was classified as a discontinued operation.
However under US GAAP Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB Topic 5E due principally to the continuing 15% equity interest of the Group in the disposed operations and a commitment by the Group to provide additional funding to finance the IneosChlor business the entity should not be deconsolidated.
US
GAAP accounting for the ChlorChemicals business may therefore differ from that under UK GAAP and may involve applying an equity method of accounting for any future losses that may arise up to the full amount of the Groups investment and committed funding.
The approximate gross assets and gross liabilities of ChlorChemicals are 155m and 155m respectively under UK GAAP at 31 December 2002.
In 2002 the Group entered into an agreement to dispose of its investment in Notes and equity of Huntsman International Holdings LLC HIH to the same counterparty for completion by 15 May 2003.
A substantial deposit was received on the sale of the Notes 109m but none in respect of the equity which is therefore regarded as an option for US GAAP purposes.
The sale of the HIH Notes is at a loss to the Group while the equity transaction if consummated under the agreed terms will result in a gain in excess of the loss on the HIH
The Group believes it is highly likely that both transactions will be completed and accordingly under UK GAAP the Group has not recognised the loss on the HIH Notes of approximately 40m nor the estimated net overall gain of approximately 55m and has discontinued the application of the equity method of accounting for its investment in HIH to reflect the change in economic benefits.
Further explanation of the accounting for this complex transaction under UK GAAP is given in Note 17.
Under US GAAP the Notes transaction and the potential equity transaction have been accounted for as separate transactions since they are not interdependent.
Accordingly under US GAAP a loss has been recognised on the sale of the HIH Notes approximately 40 million and the gain on the equity transaction approximately 95m will be recognised when it occurs.
Additionally under US GAAP the Group has continued to account for its equity investment in HIH under the equity method of accounting and therefore has continued to recognise its proportionate share of HIHs operating results.
The equity accounted results from 18 June 2002 a pretax loss of 10m have been included in the US GAAP net income reconciliation.
An employee share trust has been established in order to hedge obligations in respect of options issued under certain employee share option schemes.
Under UK GAAP the Companys Ordinary Shares held by the employee share trust are included at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value in fixed asset investments.
Under US GAAP such shares are treated as treasury stock and included in shareholders equity at historic cost.
Under UK GAAP the proposed dividends on Ordinary Shares as recommended by the directors are deducted from shareholders equity and shown as a liability in the balance sheet at the end of the period to which they relate.
Under US GAAP such dividends are only deducted from shareholders equity upon declaration of the dividend.
The Group adopted FRS No.
19 Deferred Tax in 2002 for UK GAAP purposes.
Consequently the consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2001 and 2000 and the three year period ended 31 December 2002 have been restated and disclosures have been modified to reflect retroactively the impact of the adoption of FRS 19 on such financial statements as required by UK GAAP.
FRS 19 requires that full provision for deferred tax is recognised in the financial statements.
The adoption of FRS 19 has eliminated most of the differences that previously existed between UK GAAP and US GAAP.
As a result the adjustment for taxation now primarily relates to the tax effect of other US GAAP adjustments.
ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS AND FORM 20F 2002 notes relating to the accounts 109 42 Differences between UK and US accounting principles continued k Share compensation expense In the Groups consolidated financial statements prepared under UK GAAP no compensation expense is recognised in respect of the Groups share option schemes.
Under US GAAP compensation cost has been recognised for all options including arrangements under the Groups UK Sharesave scheme.
The cost is calculated as the difference between the option price and the market price at the end of the reporting period for all option plans including performance related criteria.
In the Groups UK Sharesave scheme the cost is calculated as the difference between the option price and the market price at date of grant.
The cost is amortised over the period from the date the options are granted to the date they are first exercisable that is the vesting date.
Following the issue of EITF 0023 Issues Related to the Accounting for Share Compensation under APB Opinion No.
25 and FASB Interpretation No.
44 the cost of the 2002 grant under the Groups UK Sharesave scheme is treated in accordance with all other plans.
At 31 December 2002 the Group had a number of sharebased compensation plans which are described in note 23 of the Groups financial statements.
The Group recognises compensation costs for US GAAP purposes in accordance with the requirements of APB Opinion No.
Had compensation costs for the Groups share option plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant date for awards under those plans consistent with the method of SFAS No.
123 Accounting for StockBased Compensation the Groups net income of 9m in 2002 would have been reduced to 3m.
The basic earnings per share as reported of 0.8p would be 0.3p on a proforma basis 2001 restated 1.5p would be 0.5p 2000 no material difference.
SFAS No.
142 Goodwill and Intangible Assets In June 2001 the FASB issued SFAS No.
142 Goodwill and Intangible Assets which superseded APB 17 Intangible Assets.
SFAS No. intangible assets.
Upon adoption of SFAS No.142 an impairment test must be carried out on all intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and goodwill.
The test for intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and of goodwill must be carried out annually.
In addition the useful economic lives of definite life intangibles are to be reviewed.
Any impairment loss identified on the date of adoption of SFAS No.
142 is accounted for as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle.
The Group adopted the requirements of SFAS No.
142 on 1 January 2002 when the Group had unamortised goodwill of 3757m and intangible assets with a gross carrying amount of 300m less accumulated amortisation of 135m under US GAAP.
The definite life intangible assets are being amortised over a period of 10 years amortisation expense for the period 30m.
Amortisation of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and goodwill ceased from 1 January 2002 resulting in an increase in US GAAP net income of 131m basic earnings per Ordinary Share 11.8p diluted earnings per Ordinary Share 11.7p.
If the standard had been applied in the year ended 31 December 2001 and 2000 US GAAP net income would have been 134m EPS 15.4p higher  basic and diluted higher 2000 126m and 14.5p higher  basic and diluted The goodwill balance under US GAAP at 31 December 2002 amounted to 3507m 2001 3757m.
The segmental analysis of this goodwill based on the Groups defined segments is as follows National Starch 1967m 2001 2038m Quest 742m 2001 770m Performance Specialties 256m 2001 280m Paints 523m 2001 662m and Regional and Industrial 19m 2001 7m.
The significant movements in the period include the impairment of the goodwill relating to Paints Latin America 122m as described below the disposal of Synetix and the related goodwill 13m and exchange.
In the period to 31 December 2002 an impairment of 122m was recognised representing the entire goodwill in the Paints Latin America reporting unit.
Under UK GAAP the majority of the goodwill related to acquisitions prior to 1998 and has been eliminated against reserves.
This impairment resulted from the current difficult economic environment in the region and has been disclosed in the US GAAP reconciliation under the heading Purchase accounting adjustment.
The fair value of the reporting unit as required under the first stage of impairment in SFAS No.142 was calculated using a present value technique.
This involved discounting the future cash flows of the reporting unit at an appropriate risk adjusted discount rate for the region.
In calculating the fair value significant management judgement was applied for example the quantification of the underlying cash flows of the reporting unit including terminal growth values and the selection of an appropriate discount rate.
As the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its book value a second stage was performed which compared the fair value of the units goodwill to the book value of its goodwill.
Fair value procedures similar to those used in a business combination were used in this stage.
SFAS No.
144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of LongLived
In August 2001 the FASB issued SFAS No.
144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of LongLived Assets.
SFAS No.
144 requires longlived assets to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.
SFAS No.
144 requires companies to report separately discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale.
The Group was required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No.
144 from 1 January 2002 but there were no events or changes in circumstances which indicated that the carrying values of assets might not be recoverable nor components of the Groups operations disposed of by sale abandonment or in a distribution to owners or classified as held for sale which required to be disclosed except as disclosed in section g.
EITF 0109 Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer Including a Reseller of the Vendors Products EITF 0109 was issued in November 2001 by the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF.
The pronouncement codifies and reconciles the consensus reached on EITF 0014 0022 and 0025 which addresses the recognition measurement and profit and loss account classification of certain selling expenses.
The adoption of this issue has resulted in the reclassification of certain selling expenses including sales incentives slotting fees buydowns and distributor payments from cost of sales and administrative expenses to a reduction in sales.
The Group has calculated that the adoption of EITF 0109 in the year ended 31 December 2002 decreased sales and cost of salesadministrative expenses as reported under UK GAAP by 55m 2001 50m 2000 52m.
The adoption of EITF 0109 had no effect on trading profit.
ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS AND FORM 20F 2002 m New US Accounting Standards and pronouncements not yet effective In June 2001 the FASB issued SFAS No.
143 Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.
SFAS No.
143 requires the Company to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets that result from the acquisition construction development andor normal use of the assets.
SFAS No.
143 is applicable for 2003.
The Group has not yet completed evaluating the effect of this standard on its financial statements.
SFAS No.
146 Accounting for the Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity should be measured at fair value and recorded when it meets the definition of a liability in FASB Concepts Statement No.6  Elements of Financial Statements.
SFAS No.
Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity Including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring which required recognition of a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity initiated after 31 December 2002.
Restatement of prior periods is not required.
Since SFAS No.
146 applies to future activities which may not yet have been envisaged the impact of the application of SFAS No.146 cannot be determined in advance.
FASB Interpretation No.
45 Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others was issued in November 2002.
This interpretation addresses the disclosure to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligation under guarantees.
FIN No.
45 also requires the guarantor to recognise a liability for the non contingent component of the guarantee that is the obligation to stand ready to perform in the event that specified triggering events or conditions occur.
The initial measurement of this liability is the fair value of the guarantee at inception.
The Group has adopted the disclosure requirements of FIN No.
45 and will apply the recognition and measurement provisions for all guarantees entered into or modified after 31 December 2002.
There are a number of contracts relating to businesses which we exited as part of our disposal programme which have not been novated to the purchasers of these businesses.
Note 40 discloses the nature and circumstances of the material guarantees together with their present value.
The maximum potential amount of future undiscounted payments under all ICIs guarantees as defined by FIN No.
45 including those disclosed in Note 40 with terms ranging between 1 to 15 years amounted to 1217m at 31 December 2002.
After taking into account various mitigating and recourse factors mainly the ability to procure products from other sources and to onward sell the various products and services the maximum potential amount of future undiscounted payments is reduced to 311m.
In December 2002 the FASB issued SFAS No.
148 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure  an amendment of FASB No.
SFAS No.
148 permits two additional transition methods for entities that adopt the fair value based method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation.
The statement also requires new disclosures about the rampup effect of stockbased employee compensation on reported results and that those effects be disclosed more prominently by specifying the form content and location of those disclosures.
The transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions of SFAS No.
148 are effective fiscal years ending after 15 December 2002 with earlier application permitted in certain circumstances.
The interim disclosure provisions are effective for financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after 15 December 2002.
The Group has not decided yet if it will adopt either of the transition method alternatives of SFAS No.148.
FASB Interpretation No.
46 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities was issued in January 2003.
The interpretation addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities and requires such entities to be consolidated even if it is not controlled as a subsidiary if the equity investor is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities.
The consolidation requirements of Interpretation No.
46 apply immediately to variable interest entities created after 31 January 2003 and apply to older entities from 15 June 2003.
The Group does not expect the impact of FIN No.
46 to have an impact on its financial statements.

ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS AND FORM 20F 2002
The following discussion is intended as a general guide only.
Shareholders who are in any doubt with regard to tax matters or who are resident in countries other than the United Kingdom or USA should consult their tax adviser.
The Double Taxation Income Convention of 1975 the Current Convention between the United Kingdom and the United States has been renegotiated and an agreed text of a new Convention the New Convention has been published.
As at 12 February 2003 the new Convention has not been ratified by the US government.
The New Convention will not come into force until after ratification.
Until then the Current Convention remains in force.
The following summary of the principal UK and certain US tax consequences of ownership of Ordinary Shares or ADSs held as capital assets by US resident shareholders is based on current UK and US Federal tax law and practice and in part on representations of JPMorgan Chase Bank as Depositary for ADSs and assumes that each obligation in the deposit agreement among the Company the Depositary and the holders from time to time of ADSs and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms.
The US Treasury has expressed concerns that parties to whom ADSs are pre released may be taking actions that are inconsistent with the claiming by US holders of ADSs of foreign tax credits for US federal income tax purposes.
Accordingly the analysis of the creditability of UK taxes described below could be affected by future actions that may be taken by the US Treasury.
Taxation of dividends paid to US Shareholders For US federal income tax purposes the sum of the dividend paid and any associated tax credit or UK withholding tax considered to have been paid with respect to the dividend is includible in gross income by US resident shareholders that claim the benefits of the Current Convention and for foreign tax credit limitation purposes is foreign source income treated separately together with other items of passive income or in the case of certain holders financial services income.
The withholding is treated as a foreign income tax which may subject to certain restrictions and limitations be eligible for credit against a US resident shareholders US federal income tax liability or deductible by such shareholder in computing taxable income.
Changes to UK tax law in relation to dividends paid on or after 6 April 1999 result in no effective repayment of any part of the tax credit associated with a dividend paid on or after 6 April 1999 being available under the Current Convention.
However US resident shareholders that claim the benefits of the USUK income tax treaty may elect to include in gross income an amount equal to a tax credit of oneninth of the cash dividend paid and subject to certain restrictions and limitations claim a foreign tax credit for an equal amount of withholding tax.
Shareholders should note that upon ratification of the New Convention if in its current form no foreign tax credit will be available in respect of any associated tax credit or UK withholding tax considered to have been paid with respect to any dividend payment.
No dividends received deduction is allowed to US resident corporate shareholders with respect to dividends paid by the Company.
Taxation on capital gains In certain circumstances when a shareholder in the UK sells shares liability to tax in respect of capital gains is computed by reference to the market value of the shares on 31 March 1982.
The market value of ICI Ordinary Shares at 31 March 1982 for the purposes of capital gains tax was 309p.
ICI and Zeneca demerged on 1 June 1993.
Postdemerger ICI shares inherited a base cost for capital gains equivalent to 0.50239 of their predemerger base cost.
For the purposes of UK taxation of capital gains CGT the issue of new ICI shares in the rights issue is regarded as a reorganisation of the share capital of ICI.
New shares acquired by taking up an entitlement under the rights issue are treated as the same asset as and having been acquired at the same time as and at the same aggregate cost as the existing holding of ICI shares.
The subscription money for the new shares is added to the base cost of the existing holding.
In the case of shareholders within the charge to corporation tax indexation allowance will apply to the amount paid for the new shares only from the date the amount is paid or liable to be paid.
Under the Current Convention each contracting state may in general tax capital gains in accordance with the provisions of its domestic law.
Under present UK law individuals who are neither resident nor ordinarily resident in the UK and companies which are not resident in the UK will not generally be liable to UK tax on capital gains made on the disposal of their Ordinary Shares or ADSs unless such Ordinary Shares or ADSs are held in connection with a trade profession or vocation carried on in the UK through a branch or agency.
However an individual who is temporarily resident outside the UK may in certain circumstances be subject to tax on gains realised whilst he or she is resident outside the UK.
A US resident shareholder will recognise capital gain or loss for US federal income tax purposes on the sale or exchange of the Ordinary Shares or ADSs in the same manner as such holder would on the sale or exchange of any other shares held as capital assets.
Any gain or loss will generally be US source income or loss.
US resident shareholders should consult their own tax advisors about the treatment of capital gains.
UK inheritance tax Under the current Double Taxation Estates Convention the Estate Tax Convention between the US and the UK Ordinary Shares or ADSs held by an individual shareholder who is domiciled for the purposes of the Estate Tax Convention in the US and is not for the purposes of the Estate Tax Convention a national of the United Kingdom nor resident in the UK for the last seven out of ten tax years will generally not be subject to the UK inheritance tax on the individuals death nor on a chargeable gift of the Ordinary Shares or ADSs during the individuals lifetime provided that any applicable US federal gift or estate tax liability is paid unless the Ordinary Shares or ADSs are part of the business property of a permanent establishment of the individual in the UK or in the case of a shareholder who performs independent personal services pertain to a fixed base situated in the UK.
Where the Ordinary Shares or ADSs have been placed in trust by a settlor who at the time of settlement was a US resident shareholder the Ordinary Shares or ADSs will generally not be subject to UK inheritance tax unless the settlor at the time of settlement was not domiciled in the US or was a UK national.
In the exceptional case where the Ordinary Shares or ADSs are subject both to UK inheritance tax and to US federal gift or estate tax the Estate Tax Convention generally provides for double taxation to be relieved by means of credit relief.
RISK FACTORS ICI operates in competitive markets.
If the Group does not continue to compete in its markets effectively by developing innovative products and responding effectively to the activities of its competitors it could lose customers and its results of operations could be adversely affected.
ICI has a wide portfolio of business units competing across a diverse range of geographic and product markets.
The Groups business may be adversely affected if it does not continue to develop innovative products that satisfy customer needs and preferences develop new technology or enhance existing technology that supports product development or provides cost or other advantages over its competitors and attract and retain skilled employees that are key to creating new products.
Because the Group is subject to price competition from its competitors it must also continue to satisfy these objectives while maintaining a competitive cost base.
In addition some of ICIs competitors in certain markets are larger and have greater financial resources than the Group which may enable them to deliver products on more attractive terms or to invest larger amounts of capital into their businesses including expenditures for research and development.
If any of the Groups current or future competitors develop proprietary technology that enables them to produce new products or services or to deliver existing products or services at a significantly lower cost its products and services could be rendered uneconomical or obsolete.
While some of the Groups product range comprises products and services that are protected by proprietary knowledge or patents some of its businesses use technology that is widely available.
Accordingly certain product segments of the Groups business may be vulnerable to new competitors and may be adversely affected by increased price competition.
Any of these developments could lead to a loss of customers and could adversely affect the Groups results of operations.
The price volatility of some of the raw materials ICI uses could adversely affect its results of operations ICI uses significant amounts of various chemicals and other materials as raw materials in manufacturing its products.
Prices for some of these raw materials are volatile and are affected by cyclical movements in commodity prices availability of such raw materials demand for a variety of products which are produced using these raw materials levels of price competition among local and global suppliers and general economic conditions.
The Groups diverse portfolio of value added products provides some ability to pass on higher input prices to its customers but this ability is to a large extent dependent upon market conditions.
There may be periods of time in which the Group is not able to recover increases in the cost of raw materials for some products due to weakness in demand for such products or the actions of its competitors.
This may adversely affect the Groups results of operations.
The occurrence of major operational problems could have an adverse effect on the Groups results of operations and cash flow.
The Groups revenues are dependent on the continued operation of its various manufacturing facilities.
Operational risks include equipment and systems failures failure to comply with applicable regulations and standards and to maintain necessary permits and approvals raw material supply disruptions labour force shortages or work stoppages events impeding or increasing the cost of transporting products natural disasters and terrorist attacks.
While the Group maintains insurance at levels that it believes are typical for its industry some of these operational risks and problems could result in uninsured losses or liabilities or in losses and liabilities in excess of its insurance coverage.
The occurrence of major operational problems resulting from the above or other events may have an adverse effect on the results of operations of a particular manufacturing facility or with respect to certain of these risks the results of operations and cash flow of the Group as a whole.
ICI derives a significant percentage of its revenue in some of its businesses from sales to major customers and if it is unable to retain these customers its results of operations could be adversely affected.
While no single customer accounted for more than 10% of Group sales in 2002 sales to major customers in some of its businesses particularly in the Paints and Quest businesses are significant.
ICI believes that the wide selling range and nature of the specialty products it supplies reduce the potential adverse consequences of the loss of business from any one customer for any one of its products or in any one of its businesses.
Nevertheless the loss of major customers without replacement could have an adverse effect on results of operations.
The Groups reliance on key suppliers in some of its businesses could result in an adverse effect on results of operations.
Some of the Groups business units rely on a small number of suppliers for their key raw materials.
If any of these suppliers is unable to meet its obligations or increases its prices the Group may not be able to find a replacement supplier that is able to provide such raw materials on similar terms.
Consequently the Group may be forced to pay higher prices to obtain raw materials which it may not be able to pass on to its customers in the form of increased prices for its finished products.
In addition some of the raw materials used may become unavailable and there can be no assurance that the Group will be able to obtain suitable and cost effective substitutes.
Furthermore any consolidation in the industries that supply the Groups raw materials could further reduce the number of available suppliers.
Any interruption of supply or price increases caused by these or other factors which the Group is not able to mitigate by securing satisfactory replacement suppliers could have an adverse effect on its results of operations.
ICIs indebtedness and leverage could reduce its operational and competitive flexibility increase its vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions increase its interest costs and adversely affect results of operations and cash flow.
ICIs outstanding net indebtedness amounted to 1.67bn as of 31 December 2002.
ICIs indebtedness could affect the Group in adverse ways in particular by requiring the Group to dedicate a significant portion of its operational cash flow to service payments on such indebtedness and by limiting its ability to borrow additional funds or refinance existing indebtedness on attractive terms.
Furthermore its indebtedness could increase its vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions limit its ability to fund future capital expenditures research and development and other general corporate requirements and limit its flexibility to react to changes in its business and the industries in which the Group operates.
ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS AND FORM 20F 2002 RISK FACTORS continued In addition like many other companies ICI is dependent on its ability to obtain shortterm financing to fund a portion of its financing requirements.
While ICI has access to 1.5bn in committed and undrawn bank facilities as of 31 December 2002 any limitation on its ability to access shortterm financing could increase its interest costs and could adversely affect its results of operations and cash flow.
A decision by the rating agencies to downgrade ICIs credit rating would reduce its funding options increase its cost of borrowings and have an adverse impact on results of operations and cash flow.
The Group is currently rated investment grade by the major U. agencies.
A number of factors some of which are not within its control may individually or in combination affect the rating agencies view of the Groups credit profile and lead them to place the Group on credit watch or downgrade its credit rating including the failure to receive sales proceeds from the disposal of noncore businesses or assets within a time period acceptable to the rating agencies a significant deterioration in the Groups trading position a significant deterioration in the economic environment in which the Group operates the incurrence of substantial costs arising from the Groups contingent liabilities or the occurrence of any of the events described in the other risk factors contained in this Annual Report and Accounts and Form 20F.
Any downgrade of the Groups credit rating would reduce its funding options including a loss of access to the major commercial paper and money markets significantly increase its cost of borrowings and have an adverse effect on results of operations and cash flow.
Recently disposed businesses may expose ICI to costs that could have an adverse effect on its results of operations cash flow and financial condition.
In recent years ICI has carried out a programme of strategic disposals in the course of which it has given to other parties in those transactions certain indemnities warranties and guarantees including indemnities warranties and guarantees relating to known and potential latent environmental health and safety liabilities.
There are also a number of contracts relating to businesses that ICI exited as part of its disposal programme which have not been novated to the purchasers of these businesses.
In connection with the Groups disposal of its ChlorChemicals business to Ineos Chlor Ineos Chlor has made a 65 million claim against the Group relating to expenditures allegedly required on the Runcorn site which the Group is disputing.
As yet legal proceedings have not been commenced by Ineos Chlor but it is possible that they will be in the near future.
Ineos Chlor has also approached the UK Department of Trade and Industry to seek Regional Selective Assistance for certain capital projects and is also seeking financial support from its parent company and ICI.
The Group has received reports that Ineos Chlor may seek to close part or all of its business if this financial support is not forthcoming.
If such a closure were to occur a number of ChlorChemicals contracts in ICIs name which have not yet been novated to Ineos Chlor and certain environmental liabilities could revert to ICI or be accelerated.
In connection with the sale of ICIs interests in Teesside Gas Transportation Ltd and Teesside Power Ltd the Group received counter guarantees from Enron Corp. gas purchase contracts.
While the two businesses for which ICI have provided these guarantees continue to operate normally Enron Corp. has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States.
As of 31 December 2002 the estimate of the Groups maximum potential liability under these guarantees was 448m.
The extent to which ICI will be required in the future to incur costs under any of the indemnifications warranties guarantees or contracts discussed above or any similar contractual provision which the Group entered into in connection with its disposal programme is not predictable and if the Group should incur such costs the costs could have an adverse effect on results of operations cash flow and financial condition.
On 17 June 2002 ICI announced it had reached agreement with CSFB Global Opportunities Partners L.
Opportunities Partners L.
International Holdings LLP.
US160m has been received to date with a further US280m due prior to 15 May 2003.
Any delay or failure by Matlin Patterson Global Opportunities Partners L.
Specialty Chemicals Corporation to complete the purchase of ICIs 30% equity interest under the Option Agreement could have an adverse effect on the Groups cash flow and financial condition.
Risks associated with the Groups international operations could adversely affect its results of operations.
ICI is an international business with operations located in over 50 countries and conducts business in many currencies.
These operations are subject to the risks associated with international operations which include slowdown or recession in global regional or national economic growth tariffs and trade barriers exchange controls fluctuations in national currencies social and political risks national and regional labour disputes required compliance with a variety of foreign laws regulations and standards and the difficulty of enforcing legal claims and agreements through some foreign legal systems.
Furthermore ICIs Regional and Industrial businesses are subject to cyclical fluctuations in the industries and economies in which they operate.
Finally like all international businesses ICI faces the risk of exposure when costs arise in a different currency than sales and the risk arising from the need to translate foreign currency denominated profits into pounds sterling the Groups reporting currency.
Any of the risks discussed above could adversely affect its results of operations.
Economic social and political conditions in developing economies could adversely affect the Groups results of operations and future growth.
ICI has operations in many developing economies in Asia and Latin America and its strategy includes continuing to expand its business in these regions.
However many developing economies have recent histories of economic social and political instability brought about by shareholder information continued 121 a number of factors including unexpected changes in local laws regulations and standards substantial depreciation and volatility in national currencies the imposition of trade barriers and wage and price controls.
In particular ICIs businesses in Argentina and Brazil have been and may continue to be affected by recent economic conditions in those countries.
Any of these factors could adversely affect ICIs results of operations and future growth.
ICIs exposure to consumer markets exposes it to legal risks regulation and potential liabilities from product liability claims asserted by consumers which could have an adverse effect on results of operations and financial condition.
A significant proportion of the Groups products is sold directly or indirectly to enduser consumers even if it does not itself provide these products directly to consumers.
This exposure to consumer markets exposes the Group to legal risks regulation by relevant authorities and potential liabilities to consumers of these products which may not be covered by the Groups existing insurance coverage or may exceed its insurance coverage.
Any of these factors could have an adverse effect on the Groups results of operations and financial condition.
Certain companies in the Group are defendants in various lawsuits which if successfully asserted against them could have an adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition.
Certain companies in the Group are defendants in various lawsuits.
These lawsuits concern issues such as alleged product liability contract disputes and property damage matters.
For a more detailed discussion of these lawsuits see note 40 to the consolidated financial statements.
One of ICIs subsidiaries Glidden is a defendant along with other former lead paint and pigment producers as well as other lead related products manufacturers and their trade associations in a number of lawsuits in the United States including a class action lawsuit and two lawsuits by municipal authorities.
Lawsuits have been served on Glidden because an alleged predecessor company of Glidden manufactured lead pigments until the 1950s and leadbased consumer paints until the 1960s.
Due to the nature of the suits Glidden is unable to quantify the amount being claimed although the suits are likely to involve substantial claims for damages.
These lawsuits relate to alleged injury caused by lead related products or for the costs of removing leadbased paint.
Rulings adverse to Glidden or other defendants could lead to additional claims.
The successful assertion of claims made under these or other current or future lawsuits could have an adverse effect on the Groups results of operations and financial condition.
Violations of environmental health and safety and other laws regulations and standards could restrict the Groups operations expose it to liability increase its costs and have an adverse effect on its results of operations cash flow and financial condition.
ICI is subject to a broad range of laws regulations and standards in each of the jurisdictions where it operates relating to pollution the health and safety of employees protection of the public protection of the environment and the generation storage handling transportation treatment disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials.
These regulations and standards are becoming increasingly stringent.
For example the U.
Comprehensive
Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act or CERCLA imposes liability without regard to fault or the legality of a partys conduct on certain categories of persons known as potentially responsible parties who are considered to have contributed to the release of hazardous substances into the environment.
In the ordinary course of business ICI is subject to inspections and monitoring by the appropriate enforcement authorities.
ICI also requires relevant permits and approvals for its operations which require compliance with their terms and which may be subject to renewal modification and in some circumstances revocation.
It is the Groups policy to require that its subsidiaries comply with relevant laws regulations and standards.
However violations of applicable laws regulations and standards in particular provisions of environmental health and safety laws including spills or other releases of hazardous substances to the environment or of permit or approval requirements could result in restrictions on the operation of the Groups facilities damages fines or other sanctions increased costs of compliance as well as reputational damage.
ICI is also subject to environmental laws and regulations principally in respect of soil and groundwater remediation that in the future may require it to take action to correct effects on the environment of prior disposal or release of chemical substances by the Group or other parties.
ICI has established provisions in respect of future environmental health and safety liabilities that are not covered by enforceable indemnities from third parties for which expenditure is probable and the cost of which can be estimated within a reasonable range of outcomes.
These actual and potential liabilities however are inherently difficult to predict and to quantify.
Existing provisions could therefore be inadequate to cover these liabilities and additional costs to meet such actual and potential obligations could have an adverse effect on the Groups results of operations cash flow and financial condition.
ICI has given undertakings and guarantees relating to pension funds including the solvency of the ICI UK Pension Fund which could have an adverse effect on its results of operations and cash flow.
ICI provides retirement benefits for the majority of its former and current employees through a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution schemes.
These include the ICI UK Pension Fund which is ICIs largest defined benefit scheme and which at 31 December 2002 had liabilities of approximately 6.5bn.
This fund accounts for approximately 87% of ICIs retirement benefit schemes by asset value and projected benefit terms and covers approximately 82000 former and current employees in the UK.
ICI has guaranteed the solvency of the ICI UK Pension Fund.
Based on the last actuarial valuation at 31 March 2000 which included funding shortfalls amounting to 2% of the liabilities ICI is currently making additional contributions to it of 30m per year until 31 March 2006 to cover past funding shortfalls.
A further actuarial valuation is due to take place at 31 March 2003.
At 31 December 2002 over 75% of the funds assets were invested in fixedincome securities which should reduce volatility in the market value of the fund.
The balance of the funds assets were invested almost exclusively in equities.
Accordingly ICI is exposed to the financial performance of its retirement benefit schemes and particularly to the financial performance of the ICI UK Pension Fund.
In the event that the market value of the ICI UK Pension Funds assets declines in relation to its liabilities ICI may be required including as a consequence of the 31 March 2003 actuarial valuation to increase its additional contributions to cover any further funding shortfalls in the ICI UK Pension Fund.
This could have an adverse impact on the Groups results of operations and cash flow.

chairmans statement
Prot before tax at 400m was essentially the same as in 2001 and earnings per share for 2002 were 23.7p both quoted before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items.
The dividend for the year was 7.5p.
As we look to 2003 we believe it would be prudent to assume that the competitive environment will continue to be challenging and that high levels of customer satisfaction will require the very highest levels of quality value and technology.
This standard of performance must be achieved with worldclass productivity and overall business efciency to achieve satisfactory nancial results.
The ICI team is dedicated to achieving these imperatives.
We have a highly skilled and motivated management and workforce and immense technological capability.
Our products number in the tens of thousands and we compete in a wide range of market segments including food personal care home improvement and adhesives.
We believe that our extensive product and technology base provides us with a solid foundation on which to build.
As in 2002 the efcient use of capital will be of the highest priority.
We will continue to compete vigorously in all of the worlds major market places and will place particular emphasis on the high growth countries.
And nally a comment on governance.
ICI has a long history of adhering to a strong ethical code.
It is a tradition of which we are proud and as custodians of that tradition we are deeply conscious of the trust that you have placed in us.
I want to assure you that your Board of Directors continues to be dedicated to the highest standards of corporate governance nancial control and reporting.
I would like to thank you again for your support for the Rights Issue in early 2002 and on behalf of the entire ICI team give you our pledge that we will continue to do all in our power to deliver value to you our shareholders.
As we looked ahead at the beginning of 2002 we shared the widespread optimism that we would see a recovery in the major economies around the globe stronger stock markets and rising consumer condence.
Instead as the year progressed it became clear that 2002 would be another very challenging year for business.
The majority of our major markets with the notable exception of China experienced little or no economic growth and fragile consumer condence.
The weakness in global stock markets and the effect on individual and household net worth and consumer sentiment gave cause for widespread concern as did the continuing anxiety over the threat of terrorism and particularly in the latter half of the year the increased threat to global security.
When one adds to this mix of negative factors the shocking revelations of corporate malfeasance and large corporate failures principally in the United States during the year it is perhaps surprising that consumer behaviour was not even more seriously affected.
With this as the geopolitical and economic backdrop I am pleased to record that ICI nished the year in sounder shape nancially than it was a year earlier.
Thanks to strong shareholder support for the Rights Issue in the rst quarter combined with the proceeds from the sale of assets and tightly focused management of working capital your Companys balance sheet has been substantially strengthened.
These actions to reduce Group debt were successful in protecting our credit rating.
With the actions taken during 2002 behind us the shape and structure of the Group is now essentially set and our primary focus for the future will be on the growth and development of our International Businesses.
Despite the weak economic environment the International Businesses turned in a creditable performance.
The Group achieved sales of 6125m in 2002 5% lower than in 2001 Lord Trotman Chairman 7 chief executives statement lower on a comparable basis.
Given the weakness in most major Western economies this was a creditable performance.
Overall
The Groups net operating cash ow improved substantially for the year particularly with the benets of further working capital efciency improvements in the International Businesses.
The International Businesses achieved comparable sales growth in three regions of the world with the strongest growth in Asia.
The Group also performed well in North America and Europe seen against the backdrop of lower economic growth.
And whilst sales in hard currency terms were down in Latin America the signicant weakening of the exchange rates in Argentina and Brazil were primary contributors to this.
Paints once again led the way despite the difcult economic conditions in Latin America with continued doubledigit sales and prot growth in Asia and good performances in both Europe and North America.
National Starch improved sales and prot with excellent progress in Asia and a return to growth in North America.
Its electronics businesses grew sales by 6% in difcult markets and in the second half adhesives returned to topline growth.
Food and Industrial Starches and Specialty Synthetic Polymers also delivered good sales growth.
Uniqema made a weak start to the year with industrial demand down.
The picture improved somewhat as the year progressed but yearonyear comparable prots fell 24% although the high growth potential areas of lubricants and personal care were more encouraging with sales growth of 9% and 4% respectively.
Quest achieved good sales growth in North America and Asia.
Fine fragrances performed particularly strongly.
However problems 2002 was a signicant year for ICI and although the hoped for global economic upturn did not materialise we emerged in substantially better shape than a year earlier.
The early months of the year were dominated by the successful execution of the Rights Issue which raised net proceeds of just over 800m making it one of the largest to date in London.
It received excellent and much appreciated support with shareholders taking up more than 91% of the rights.
Once again Id like to thank shareholders for conrming their condence that ICIs strategy is the right one to deliver longterm success.
The intended sale of Synetix our catalyst business was announced in February.
A sale agreement with Johnson Matthey was concluded in September and the divestment was subsequently completed with gross proceeds of 260m.
In June we also reached agreement with CSFB Global Opportunities Partners for the sale of ICIs interest in Huntsman International Holdings.
We received an initial cash payment of 160m 109m with the balance of 280m 174m payable before the end of May 2003.
The combination of the Rights Issue divestment proceeds and our success in improving organic cash generation reduced the level of yearend debt from almost 3bn in 2001 to less than 1.7bn in 2002.
Interest cover for the year rose from 3.5 to 4.3 times.
With structurally lower levels of debt ICI exited 2002 with a balance sheet that provides a solid foundation from which to grow the prot of our core specialty products and paints businesses.
Performance 2002 In performance terms our businesses once again demonstrated resilience in economically difcult times.
Prot before tax goodwill amortisation and exceptional items of 400m was only 1m lower than last year.
Our International Businesses delivered comparable sales growth of 1% and trading prot of 543m that was only 1% chief executives statement continued instant success in the UK.
Our science and technology function continues to enhance its reputation.
National Starch researchers for example are working with the US Army Research Laboratories developing sealants and encapsulants to protect tomorrows exible at screens from moisture and oxygen.
Some of our largest global customers have expressed interest in understanding how ICI businesses technology and knowhow might be leveraged in collaborations to generate longterm added value for their product development programmes.
ICI is focused on growth and we have an increasing number of people in the regions with signicant potential.
In China an important growth market we now have 1400 employees up from some 900 only four years ago and we continue to invest in manufacturing and marketing facilities in the country.
ICI is global but our success is often built on local management able to understand and respond to local consumer and customer requirements.
In May we published The ICI Report on the Secrets of the Senses Dr Charles Spence of Oxford Universitys ground breaking research into the importance of sensory experience for health and emotional wellbeing.
This helped focus attention on ICIs expertise in the growth areas of the science of sight scent taste and touch the heart of our business today.
Our people In conclusion I want to thank our employees all around the world for the dedication and effort that delivered commendable results under difcult conditions.
When the tide turns I know we will be ready. order backlog at our major Food site in the Netherlands.
Although the problem was largely rectied by October production was disrupted for a period.
Quest is determined to restore its reputation for excellent customer service.
For our Regional and Industrial businesses higher prots in Pakistan and Argentina were offset by the loss of prots from divested businesses and a legal provision.
Despite the respectable overall performance I regret that I cannot report the improvement in ICIs share price for which we are all working.
Against our selected peer group our ranking in terms of Total Shareholder Return remained 13 of 17.
This performance is disappointing.
The Board and I continue to believe that ICI has all the necessary components for an improved placing and are committed to achieving that improvement.
I remain convinced that given the improved strength of our balance sheet our stated goals  organic sales growth of 4 to 5% 1 to 2% above global GDP plus another 1 to 2% growth from synergistic bolton acquisitions  are achievable once economies improve.
We believe that this in combination with improved operational effectiveness will provide the basis for consistent longerterm prot growth.
Exciting progress Were already making progress on a number of fronts.
We are launching innovative new products across the Group such as Paints onecoat elastomeric Polycell Basecoat which was an Brendan ONeill Chief Executive 8 2002 was another tough year but ICI remained focused on performance.
ICIs knowhow created innovative new products and improved existing ones to help customers achieve their goals.
We pursued the best growth opportunities in global and local markets.
And technology quality value and efciency will remain vital to keeping sales up and costs down in 2003.
9 driving success through creative people Being a great place for great people to work is one of ICIs goals.
People are the vital ingredient for our success this year next year and every year.
Joining one of ICIs businesses opens up a world of opportunities that spans consumer and businesstobusiness industries around the globe.
With some 100 operating units manufacturing and selling over 50000 products in more than 55 countries an ICI career can offer a great diversity of work experience.
Today theres no such person as a typical ICI employee.
Creative and amboyant Rodrigo FloresRoux was born in Mexico trained in France and now lives and works in New York where he is one of Quests top perfumers specialising in ne fragrances.
Bob Golownia formulation chemist spent part of his Christmas break testing Dulux Fortis exterior paint in 35F weather to make certain that applying it in cold wet conditions did not impair the nish.

Members from the 25strong team of research and development manufacturing market research nance and sales people visited all 50 states and left no stone unturned to ensure the products delivered the goods from Alaska to the Everglades.
An extraordinary range of talent Interior designers perfume noses bakers chefs and food avourists webmasters and oil exploration technicians are hardly typical employees for a specialty products and paints company.
Yet within ICI they are as vital as sales and marketing people production teams chemists engineers technologists IT specialists and administrators in getting things done.
Getting the best from such a diverse mix of skills and disciplines requires strong leadership within a performance culture.
The Group addresses management and leadership development globally with a threetier management training and leadership programme designed to groom people for the next level of responsibility.
It is a process that aims to turn promising young professionals into team leaders then into seasoned managers with the skills and expertise to run businesses and ultimately to provide a grounding in developing strategy.
Skill building programmes are underway across ICI as well as in every business and function.
Training objectives are simple to develop staff with the professional and team skills required for optimum job performance and personal development so that competence and condence are enhanced at the same time as ensuring that ICI operations are safe stimulating and enjoyable places to work.
Boosting performance In recent years ICI has taken steps to ensure that staff rewards reect individual team and business performance.
Variable pay schemes are in place for a growing proportion of our professional and managerial employees cementing the link between targets achievement and team and individual rewards.
Outstanding people thrive on stimulation and challenge and the obvious reward for promising managers is early responsibility.

Sticking close to the action Our people know rsthand where economic activity is stirring and where its slowing.
In emerging markets rising sales of packaging adhesives are often the rst indicators of industrial growth.
And where adhesives lead our other businesses follow.
We were ready for the lift in China and India.
These will continue to be growth markets particularly for National Starch and Paints.
We remain convinced that Latin America despite severe recession has exciting long term prospects.
This year Quest opened a creative studio in Brazil which is emerging as a personal care market with signicant growth potential.
Central and Eastern Europe is buoyant all our businesses report with household appliance manufacturing showing particular strength for Uniqema.
Cash rich time poor It is human nature to want quality brands and advanced products when prosperity makes them accessible to the mass market.
But greater wealth often means less free time hence the growth in eating out and prepared meals sectors that ICI has targeted in recent years and which have become sizeable markets in the developed world.
The food industry represented 14% of ICI sales in 2002.
The 110 billion personal care industry continues to grow fast around the world.
Our diversity of products customers and geographic markets has been a vital ingredient in ICIs resilient performance in a challenging year.
Around the world ICI targets the industries customer segments and national markets offering the greatest potential for profitable growth.
Innovative ideas proprietary technology and knowledge and strong customer relationships are key to success in every sector.
Producers of consumer goods look to ICI for sensory signatures like flavours and fragrances industrial customers want specialty solutions and distinctive performance properties.

ICIs research pipeline has developed real momentum and its clear that ICIs science skills and technology investment strategy are bearing fruit.
Three key technology platforms relevant to all our businesses  sensory science targeted delivery and high throughput experimentation  occupy centre stage over and above the research individual businesses perform in support of their specific product development and customer needs.
ICI also calls on top academic experts for advice and guidance.
Foam is everywhere in ICI and getting foam science right is vital to success for all our businesses.
Shampoo beer refrigerator lubricants bath oils mousses edible and otherwise bread paint and packaging materials are just some of the foam applications that ICI businesses are investigating.
Better understanding of the creation elimination and control of foams and foaming could reveal further opportunities like creamy foams that dont sting the eyes for use in personal care products.
In addition to this research our central science group is using high throughput screening techniques to study visual aspects of foam.
Products from ICI have therapeutic benets in satisfying sensory needs often overlooked by modern society.
According to The ICI Report on the Secrets of the Senses by Dr Charles Spence of Oxford University a craving for colour taste scent and touch is essential for emotional health as well as physical wellbeing.
Dr Spence one of the worlds leading authorities in experimental psychology of the human senses sees ICI at the forefront of a revolution in multisensory understanding and application christened sensism.
Sensory science That colour scent taste and texture are powerful feelgood factors has been known since time began.
ICI undertakes and sponsors research into physiological responses to sensory stimuli to establish how the senses affect human health and emotions.
Armed with this knowledge we can tailor molecules that target visual smell taste and touch receptors with precision.
This helps our customers to package sensory pleasure to relieve the stresses of modern life making people healthier and more productive.
Intelligent materials Materials science underpins about twothirds of ICI sales.
Using concepts borrowed from nature ICI is developing new composite synthetic materials with complex microstructures to improve on nature scuffresistant acrylicreinforced paints are an example.
Such work centres on the study of polymer architecture and nal physical form.
The goal is to provide customers with control over effects such as delaying the release of fragrance molecules in detergents until laundry is dried or ironed or protecting avours until water is added.
Fast chemistry High throughput experimentation is a technique adopted by ICI three years ago that uses miniaturised automated equipment to accelerate screening the properties of thousands of chemical formulations enabling chemists to explore many more possibilities at much lower cost than formerly.
Time to discovery is reduced and the number of choices is increased so our businesses can respond quicker to market and customer challenges.
From the lab to the customer A new phase began in spring 2002 when the Groups technology team launched an initiative to strengthen and widen scientists connections with commercial and marketing teams across ICI.
As well as inspiring ideas for new product development or market applications within ICI wider understanding of the Groups newest technology identies more opportunities to offer additional customer benets.
As a result ICI is better leveraging its technology investment a vital ingredient in the creation of the next generation of products.
Chosen for jewellery because it doesnt corrode or tarnish gold is an almost inert metal.
Managing heat stress is critical in computers and telecommunication devices.

Replacing silver with gold eliminates the risk of corrosion from water vapour trapped in the device and manages extreme temperatures too.
Its also easier and surprisingly cheaper to use.
Materials are also the passion of Dr Paul Calvert Professor of Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Arizona and formerly at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
As aspects of Dr Calverts pioneering research promise to be of signicant value for ICI businesses we take his bluesky science very seriously indeed and welcome Paul as a key science adviser to ICI.
Tony Ryan the new ICI Professor of Physical Chemistry at Shefeld University in the UK believes science should aim to improve on natural materials.

The Board meets at least eight times a year and there is frequent contact between meetings to progress the Companys business.
The NonExecutive Directors fulfil a vital role in corporate accountability.
The remits and memberships of the three relevant Board Committees are set out on page 23.
The
Remuneration and Nomination Committee and the Audit Committee which comprise solely Non Executive Directors meet at least quarterly and report regularly to the Board.
Remuneration and Nomination Committee The Chairman and Chief Executive are in attendance at the Remuneration and Nomination Committee for appropriate items but are always excluded when their own performance and remuneration are under review.
The Chairman is not a member of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee except when it meets as the Nomination Committee.
He attends all remuneration discussions except when his own position is being discussed.
The Chairman from time to time promotes discussion with the Executive Directors about NonExecutive Directors remuneration based on external comparisons.
Any recommendations are tabled to the full Board.
NonExecutive Directors have the option of taking part of their remuneration in the Companys shares.
The Remuneration Report on pages 24 to 27 includes details on remuneration policy and practices and on the remuneration of Directors.
Lord Butler acts as the Companys Senior Non Executive Director.
In this position he promotes discussion at appropriate times about the Company chairmanship and succession to it.
The NonExecutive Directors normally meet twice a year with the Chairman and Chief Executive to discuss and evaluate Board and individual Directors performance and succession plans.
At appropriate times the Chief Executive and then the Chairman absent themselves so their performance can be assessed.
The final discussion is led by the Senior NonExecutive Director and there is feedback to individuals.
Appointments to Executive Director are fully discussed by the Chairman and Chief Executive with the Remuneration and Nomination Committee before a proposal is formally made to the Board by the Chairman of that Committee.
Possible new NonExecutive Directors are suggested by all members of the Board against the requirements of the Companys business and the need to have a balanced Board.
In appropriate cases recruitment consultants are used to assist the process.
Possible candidates are discussed with all Directors before any approach is made to them.
All Directors are subject to reelection at least every three years.
Audit and internal control In accordance with the guidance for directors on internal control The Turnbull Guidance the Board confirm that there is a process for identifying evaluating and managing the significant risks to the achievement of the Groups strategic objectives.
The process has been in place throughout 2002 and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report and Accounts and Form 20F and accords with The Turnbull Guidance.
The effectiveness of this process has been reviewed regularly by the Audit Committee who report their findings for consideration by the Board.
The processes used by the Audit Committee to review the effectiveness of the system of internal control include Discussions with management on risk areas identified by management andor the audit process The review of internal and external audit plans The review of significant issues arising from internal and external audits and The review of significant Group risks reported by the Group Risk Committee.
The Audit Committee reports to the Board the results of their review of the risk assessment process.
The Board then draws its collective conclusions as to the effectiveness of the system of internal control.
The Group Risk Committee GRC consolidates and prioritises for the Board the inputs received from management of the Businesses and corporate functions.
The GRC comprises the heads of major corporate functions the Group Internal Auditor and the General Counsel.
The
GRC meets on a regular basis to review updated input from business and corporate management and to report its conclusions to the Audit Committee.
The internal audit function reviews internal controls in all key activities of the ICI Group typically over a three year cycle.
It acts as a service to the Businesses by assisting with the continuous improvement of controls and procedures.
Actions are agreed in response to its recommendations and these are followed up to ensure that satisfactory control is maintained.
Quarterly reviews are also conducted between internal audit management and the senior management of the Businesses and major functions to assess their current control status and to identify and address any areas of concern.
The Board is responsible for maintaining and reviewing the effectiveness of the Groups system of internal controls.
The internal control systems are designed to meet the Groups particular needs and the risks to which it is exposed and are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk to the achievement of business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against misstatement or loss.
The Groups strategic direction is regularly reviewed by the Board and the Executive Management Team considers the strategy for the individual Businesses through an integrated disciplined process on a biennial basis.
Annual plans and performance targets for each Business are set by the Chief Executive and are reviewed in total by the Board in the light of the Groups overall objectives.
The processes to identify and manage the key risks to the success of the Group are an integral part of the internal control environment.
Such processes which are reviewed and improved as necessary include strategic planning the appointment of senior managers the regular monitoring of performance control over capital expenditure and investments and the setting of high standards and targets for safety health and environmental performance.
Within the financial and overall objectives for the Group agreed by the Board the management of the Group as a whole is delegated to the Executive Management Team.
The conduct of ICIs Businesses is delegated to the individual Executive Vice Presidents.
They are accountable for the conduct and performance of their Businesses within the agreed Business strategy.
They have full authority to act subject to the reserved powers and sanctioning limits laid down by the Board and to Group policies.
Businesses are responsible for meeting the defined reporting timetables and compliance with Group accounting manuals which set out accounting policies controls and definitions.
The Executive Management Team receives a monthly summary of financial results from each Business and the Groups published quarterly financial information is based on a standardised and timely reporting process.
There is a process in place which requires post event reviews to be undertaken following the completion of all major investments.
This process aims to improve the quality of business judgements through the understanding and experience gained.
Responsibility for monitoring compliance with Group policies and guidelines rests with the Executive Vice Presidents and Chief Executive Officers for operating Businesses and with senior managers for the Corporate Centre.
Annual statements of compliance are provided to the Board and these statements are reviewed by the relevant functional leader for each policy area.
In turn there is an annual report to the Audit Committee on behalf of the Board on the degree of compliance with Group policies and guidelines.
Corrections to any weaknesses found are monitored and controls are developed to match changing circumstances.
SarbanesOxley Act 2002 The Company monitors its legal and regulatory obligations following the enactment of the SarbanesOxley Act in the United States.
It is the Companys intention to comply with the legal and regulatory requirements introduced pursuant to this new legislation in so far as they are applicable to the Company.
Disclosure controls and procedures In accordance with recommendations issued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission the Company has established a Disclosure Committee comprising appropriate senior executives from the ICI corporate centre the Chief Financial Officer the General Counsel the Company Secretary the Group Internal Auditor the Investor Relations Director and the Group Financial Controller.
The Committee designs maintains and evaluates the Companys disclosure controls and procedures and reports its evaluation to the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer.

The following is a summary of the full Remuneration Report that is contained in the ICI Annual Report and Accounts and Form 20F for 2002.
Remuneration Committee Role and membership The Remuneration Committee determines on behalf of the Board the Companys policy on the remuneration of Executive Directors.
The Committee determines the total remuneration packages for these individuals including any compensation on termination of office.
This provides the framework for remunerating all senior executives.
The Remuneration Committee is comprised exclusively of independent NonExecutive Directors of the Company.
The members of the Remuneration Committee are shown on page 23.
The Committee members have no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in the matters to be decided.
The constitution and operation of the Committee comply with the Combined Code for Corporate Governance of the Financial Services Authority.
Advisers
To ensure that ICIs remuneration practices are market competitive the Remuneration Committee has access to detailed external research on market data and trends from independent and experienced international consultants.
Such advisers are appointed by the Remuneration Committee.
Where ICI executives are invited to attend meetings to respond to specific questions raised by the Committee in respect of matters under consideration this specifically excludes any matter concerning the detail of their own personal remuneration.
Remuneration policy Executive Directors The Companys ongoing remuneration policy for Executive Directors is to provide remuneration in a form and amount which will attract retain motivate and reward high calibre individuals.
To achieve this the remuneration package is based upon the following principles Incentives should align the interests of executives and shareholders reward the creation of longterm value and minimise risk for shareholders.
Reward elements should be designed to reinforce the link between performance and reward.
Performance related elements should form a significant proportion of the total remuneration package.
The total remuneration package for ontarget performance should be fully competitive in the relevant market.
Packages can be structured flexibly to meet critical resource needs and retain key executives.
Personal shareholdings In order to align the interests of our most senior employees with those of shareholders our Executive Directors and senior executives are expected to build up personal shareholdings of ICI Ordinary Shares through the retention of shares acquired via Company sharebased plans.
For Executive Directors this shareholding is as follows Target value of shareholding Chief Executive Two times base salary Executive Directors One times base salary External directorships Executive Directors are encouraged to take an external NonExecutive Directorship.
In order to avoid any conflict of interest all appointments are subject to the approval of the Remuneration Committee and the Board.
Directors retain payments received in respect of these appointments.
NonExecutive Directors The remuneration policy for NonExecutive Directors is determined by the Board.
Remuneration comprises an annual fee for acting as a NonExecutive Director and an additional fee for acting as the Chairman of a Board Committee or as the Senior NonExecutive Director.
NonExecutive Directors are not eligible to participate in incentive plans.
ICI operates a scheme which enables NonExecutive Directors to receive payment of part of their fees in the form of ICI Ordinary
Remuneration packages for Executive
The remuneration package for Executive Directors comprises five elements base salary Annual Incentive Plan Performance Growth Plan share option scheme and postretirement and other benefits.
The performance related elements when valued at target performance levels comprise more than 50% of the package excluding post retirement benefits.
Base salaries Base salaries are a fixed annual sum recognising ongoing market value.
The Companys policy is to set the salary for each Executive Director within a range around the market median for similar positions in large international publicly quoted companies.
Salaries for individual Directors are reviewed each year by the Remuneration Committee recognising the individuals performance and experience and developments in the relevant employment market.
Annual Incentive Plan The Annual Incentive Plan rewards Executive Directors for the achievement of annual financial and strategic goals of ICI and its businesses.
The financial targets which are set under the Annual Incentive Plan are derived from the strategic and annual planning processes for ICI and its businesses.
During 2002 bonus targets focused on the delivery of Economic Profit cash generation and the achievement of key strategic objectives.
Targets are established by the Board and approved by the Remuneration Committee.
The bonus opportunity available to Executive Directors for 2002 for the achievement of on target performance was 50% of base salary.
A maximum bonus opportunity of 100% of base salary was possible for the significant over achievement of the defined targets.
In the difficult economic climate of 2002 all of ICIs International Businesses achieved comparable sales growth over 2001  with both Paints and National Starch also growing their trading profit.
Strong cash generation and excellent management of working capital enhanced the operating performance of most businesses during the past year.
ICI Group targets for Economic Profit improvement and cash flow were exceeded.
In some cases the level of incentive payments additionally reflects delivery against key strategic objectives to strengthen individual businesses and the balance sheet of ICI.
Economic Profit is ICIs key internal financial measure.
This measure is based on profit after tax less a charge for the use of capital.
Economic Profit encourages both profitable growth and the efficient use of capital to generate sustainable shareholder value.
Performance Growth Plan The Performance Growth Plan PGP drives and rewards longerterm business performance improvement.
The Plan strengthens the alignment with shareholders by placing a greater emphasis on sustained longterm value creation.
For the Executive Directors the Plan makes conditional awards of ICI shares linked to performance over a fixed three year period measured as follows
Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer
Total Shareholder Return TSR vs ICIs peer group see below.
Business Heads TSR as above and Economic Profit of their own business.
In addition the Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that the underlying performance of ICI justifies the receipt of any shares.
TSR calculations are performed by independent consultants and are approved by the Remuneration Committee.
The shares required to make awards under this Plan are provided via a trust funded by ICI.
There is no dilution of ICIs issued share capital.
The maximum conditional award of 100% of base salary per annum 200% for US Directors is linked to at least upper quartile performance versus the peer group.
For median TSR performance 40% of this maximum award will be paid.
No TSR award is paid for below median performance.
Economic Profit targets are consistent with the achievement of the Companys TSR goals and ICIs strategic targets.
The peer group for the TSR element represents ICIs key global competitors and has been selected on the basis of market location size diversity and performance.
The peer group of companies for the conditional awards made in 2002 was Air Products and Chemicals Akzo Nobel Clariant Crompton Corporation Cytec Industries Ciba Specialty Chemicals Danisco Degussa Engelhard Corporation Givaudan Henkel H.
Fuller Company International Flavors and Fragrances Rhodia Rohm and Haas Company The SherwinWilliams Company.
The peer group for the 2003 awards will comprise a similar set of companies.
For the 2000  2002 performance period ICIs TSR ranked 13 out of the 17 companies in the peer group and as a result all awards under the TSR performance measure for this cycle lapsed.
Two Directors received awards under the Economic Profit measure and these are shown on page 27.
Share Option Scheme The Share Option Scheme rewards Executive Directors for longerterm corporate performance as reflected in share price appreciation.
Options to purchase the Companys Ordinary Shares may be granted each year.
Individual
Grants are made subject to a performance condition that over a three year period the growth in ICIs earnings per share excluding both amortisation of goodwill and exceptional items must be equal to or greater than the increase in the UK Retail Prices Index plus 3% per annum.
In the light of the Companys current business outlook and the quantum of the grants involved the Committee considers this to be an appropriately challenging condition for option grants made in 2002.
Options must be held for a minimum of three years from grant before they can be exercised and lapse if not exercised within ten years.
The shares to meet rights granted do not dilute ICIs issued share capital as they are bought in the market.
No gains were realised on the exercise of share options during 2002 or 2001.
Retirement benefits ICI provides retirement benefit plans for its executives which take account of local practice in the countries in which it operates.
These plans are designed as part of the total remuneration package to attract the quality of staff needed by the business and to aid mobility between countries where necessary.
In keeping with the Groups philosophy on fixed elements of reward they are normally positioned around the median of the local market.
Except where defined benefit plans already exist for current executives retirement benefits are provided on a defined contribution basis so that Company costs are stable and predictable.
Where possible plans provide flexibility and choice to increase employee commitment and enable executives to make their own contributions as well as the Company.
In this way ICI encourages and supports its executives to play an active role in planning for their individual retirement needs.
It is ICIs policy to match retirement benefit liabilities where possible by external funds rather than by Group assets.

All amounts reported for individuals are in respect of the part year for which they were employed as Directors.
2 A performance related retention arrangement linked to Annual Incentive Plan payments applies to Dr B R ONeill only.
The Remuneration Committee has determined that for each of the years 2002 to 2005 inclusive an additional cash sum equal to 50% of the earned annual bonus will be deferred and paid in 2006 normally subject to Dr ONeills continued employment with the Group.
This arrangement will operate for the first time in 2002 and the deferred payment for 2002 is 180810 2001 and prior years nil.
This is excluded from the table above and will be included when paid.
3 In 2002 Mr P J Drechsler received 9450 Ordinary Shares with a market value of 29200 2001 1954 shares with a market value of 7992 and Mr T A Scott received 4621 Ordinary Shares with a market value of 14279 2001 nil.
These matched shares were provided under the Bonus Conversion Plan which operates for the last time in respect of bonuses earned from the 1999 financial year.
A bonus recipient could elect to have shares purchased with part or all of their net bonus after tax.
After three years shares purchased in the plan are released.
4 For 2002 the figures reported are the annual base salary or fee in payment at 31 December 2002 except in respect of Mr T A Scott whose annual base salary at that date was 325000 and Lord Butler whose annual fee at that date was 40000.

6 Certain Executive Directors have a contingent interest in matched shares under the Bonus Conversion Plan provided in respect of the 1999 bonus plan which was operated for the last time in respect of that year.
Matched shares are released to the participants after three years provided the individual remains employed by ICI.
7 Certain option grants made in 1999 were subject to delay in accordance with the Financial Services Authority Listing Rules.
The Remuneration Committee decided that those individuals so affected should receive the same gross gain at the time they exercise their options as if the grant had not been delayed.
8 Prior to being appointed Directors Mr W H Powell and Mr T A Scott participated in cash based longterm incentive plans operated by the Group.
The performance period relating to these awards ended on 31 December 2002.
Mr Powell will receive no payment in respect of these units.
During 2003 Mr Scott will receive 9773 in respect of his service as a Director based on the performance of ICIs International Businesses over the three years to 31 December 2002.

2 Growth in Economic Profit was particularly strong in the Paints business and this is reflected in an above target award under this measure to Dr McAdam.
Mr Drechsler received a below target award and the award to Mr Powell lapsed.
The award based on the TSR condition to Dr ONeill also lapsed.
Directors service agreements and letters of engagement It is the Remuneration Committees policy that Executive Directors are employed on contracts subject to no more than 12 months notice in accordance with current corporate governance best practice.
The Remuneration Committee strongly endorses the principle of mitigation of damages on early termination of a service agreement.
The Chairman and Executive Directors are employed pursuant to agreements which terminate on 12 months notice.
NonExecutive Directors are appointed for an unspecified term pursuant to letters of engagement.
Further details of these are contained in the full Remuneration Report in the Annual Report and Accounts and Form 20F 2002 copies of which are available from the Company Secretary.
On behalf of the Board R N Haythornthwaite Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 12 February 2003 28 The Groups 2002 financial performance was creditable in what was a persistently challenging economic environment.
Comparable International Business sales were 1% ahead of last year with growth in North America Europe and Asia more than offsetting lower sales in Latin America.
Comparable trading profit for the International Businesses was only 1% lower with growth in Paints and National Starch being offset by lower profits in Quest and Performance Specialties.
Group profit before tax goodwill amortisation and exceptional items was 400m essentially in line with 2001.
Cash flow improved substantially in 2002.
Increased operating cash flow the successful completion of the Rights Issue and the divestment of Synetix contributed to a 1250m reduction in year end net debt to 1667m.
Interest cover also improved significantly to 4.3 times for 2002 compared to 3.5 for 2001 and 3.2 for 2000.
Trading results The results before goodwill amortisation exceptional items interest and taxation of the Groups continuing operations for last year compared to 2002 can be summarised as follows Actual Comparable increase increase 2002 2001 decrease decrease m m % %

Before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items.
After interest payable of 28m 2001 67m.
Interest
The Group net interest charge for the year was 123m compared to 162m in 2001 primarily as a result of lower average net debt during the year following the successful completion of the Rights Issue and lower interest rates.
Profit before tax Profit before tax goodwill amortisation and exceptional items for the year was 400m 1m lower than last year.
Lower trading profits for the International Businesses and a trading loss for the Regional and Industrial businesses were almost entirely offset by lower interest costs.
Profit before tax but after goodwill amortisation and exceptional items was 317m compared to 205m in 2001.
During 2002 the adverse currency translation effect compared to last year on the Groups reported profit before tax goodwill amortisation and exceptional items was 11m.
Taxation
Taxation on profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items was 115m 1m lower than last year with the Group effective tax rate being maintained at 29%.
2001 has been restated for the effect of FRS 19.
Exceptional items Exceptional items charged after trading profit for the year comprised a 50m profit from the sale or closure of businesses a 3m profit on the disposal of fixed assets and 99m written off investments.
The pretax profit from the sale or closure of operations included a 90m profit on the sale of our catalyst business Synetix and a profit on the sale of Security Systems.
These were partially offset by a 32m loss on the divestment of the UK Nitrocellulose and Energetic Technologies businesses and a 27m loss due to the liquidation of Irish Fertilizer Industries in which the Group has a 49% interest.
Amounts written off investments of 99m related to a provision against ICIs existing investments in Ineos Chlor where uncertainty exists as to the extent to which and period over which these amounts will be recovered.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items for the year were 23.7p compared to 29.8p in 2001.
The lower amount in 2002 was due to the increased number of shares in issue as a result of the Rights Issue.
Net profit after goodwill amortisation and exceptional items was 179m compared to 80m in 2001.
Basic earnings per share after goodwill amortisation and exceptional items were 16.1p compared to 9.2p in 2001.

Prior year profit and earnings per share figures have been restated for the effects of the bonus element of the Rights Issue and for FRS 19.
The weighted average number of shares in issue in 2002 was 1114m compared to 869m in 2001.
Dividend and dividend policy As previously stated the Groups dividend policy is that dividends should represent about one third of net profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items.
In line with this policy the Board has recommended a second interim dividend of 4.5p to bring the total dividend for 2002 to 7.5p.
Performance and value based management The Group remains committed to value based management and further progress was made during the year.
The Group continued to focus on better utilisation of both fixed and working capital and average working capital as a percentage of sales in the International Businesses was reduced by over 1% on a comparable basis.
Despite lower trading profits for the International Businesses the return on average net assets for the International Businesses of 20% remained unchanged from 2001.
Cash flow The following analysis of Group cash flow distinguishes between cash flows relating to operating activities and those related to portfolio reshaping and legacy issues.
Included within reshaping and legacy are gross proceeds from divestments cash expenditures following divestments including tax paid and payments against divestment provisions which in some cases will continue for a number of years the ICI UK Pension Fund topup payments and loans to associates and other investments.
Operating cash flow The Groups net operating cash flow improved significantly in 2002.
Group earnings before interest tax depreciation and goodwill amortisation for the year at 729m were 7% below 2001 mainly as a result of the lower trading profit for the International
However the benefits of working capital efficiency improvements resulted in a small cash inflow from working capital of 13m for the year some 43m better than 2001.
Capital expenditure of 219m was also 16m lower while other cash items including exceptional outflows against restructuring provisions were at a similar level to 2001.
Consequently the Group delivered an operating cash inflow after capital expenditure of 434m 2m better than for 2001.
Net interest and tax payments excluding tax on divestments during 2002 amounted to 191m some 33m lower than 2001 primarily as a result of the cash interest benefits of the Rights
Dividend payments at 127m were also 78m lower than last year following implementation of the revised dividend policy.
Acquisition expenditure was 17m 51m below 2001.
Overall for 2002 the Group generated a much improved net operating cash flow which at 99m was 164m better than for 2001.
Reshaping and legacy cash flows Reshaping and legacy cash flows benefited from the successful completion of the divestment of Synetix delivering gross proceeds of 260m and the proceeds 109m from the first installment in relation to the sale of ICIs interests in Huntsman International Holdings LLC.
Overall
2002 divestment proceeds of 458m were 114m more than for 2001.
Tax payments resulting from divestments were 8m down from 21m in the prior year.
Payments against divestment provisions were also significantly lower than last year down 165m to 133m.
The topup payment to the ICI UK Pension Fund for the year was maintained at 30m.
The next triennial actuarial review of the fund will take place at 31 March 2003.
Overall the 2002 cash flow due to reshaping and legacy items was an inflow of 250m 296m higher than 2001.
Tim Scott Chief Financial Officer Movement in net debt Cash flow before financing for the year at 349m was 460m better than in 2001.
This together with the net Rights Issue proceeds of 807m and a favourable noncash exchange rate translation impact of 94m led to a 1250m reduction in net debt at the end of the year to 1667m.

Performance Specialties
Treasury policies The Groups Treasury seeks to reduce financial risk to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest cash assets safely and profitably.
It operates within policies and procedures approved by the Board which include strict controls on the use of financial instruments in managing the Groups risk.
The Group does not undertake any trading activity in financial instruments.
The Group reviews the credit quality of counterparties and limits individual and aggregate credit exposures accordingly.
Financing
The Groups policy is to finance the Group mainly through a mixture of retained earnings and debt.
Debt is principally sourced from long term loans mediumterm notes commercial paper securitised receivables and bank debt.
The Groups borrowings are primarily raised centrally by Group finance companies and on lent to operating subsidiaries on commercial terms.
The Group borrows in the major global debt markets in a range of currencies at both fixed and floating rates of interest and uses derivatives to generate the desired currency and interest rate profile of borrowings.
The Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings is managed through the use of interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements.
The Groups policy is to maintain between 40% and 60% of its long term borrowings at fixed rates for periods of up to 5 years.
In March 2002 the Group received net proceeds of 807m following the successful completion of the Rights Issue.
These proceeds along with those from the divestments completed during the year were used to pay down debt thus significantly strengthening the Groups balance sheet improving its interest cover and securing a stable credit rating in 2002.
Liquidity and investments At 31 December 2002 the Group had at its disposal 1.509bn equivalent of committed borrowing facilities with varying maturities up to the year 2006.
Of this a 1100m committed borrowing facility is maturing in January 2004 and some 201m of shortterm committed borrowing facilities have varying maturities of less than one year.
These facilities provide back stopping for shortterm funding as well as flexibility to supplement future cash flows.
The Groups net debt position has historically changed over the course of a year and in particular shortterm debt has generally increased in the early part of the year to fund working capital requirements.
These working capital needs arise principally from the seasonality of the Paints business which experiences higher sales and thus working capital during the North American and European summer.
The Groups commercial paper programmes and other shortterm borrowings are used to fund these working capital fluctuations.
At 31 December 2002 the Group had 226m of shortterm borrowings outstanding.
During 2002 the principal movements in long term debt were a 200m 129m 10 year note maturity and 500m and 250m 484m 5 year note maturities.
Also in 2002 the Group redeemed 300m in FRPS fixed rate redeemable preference shares reducing the amount outstanding at 31 December 2002 to 100m.
The Group runs a receivables securitisation programme in the US with 95m outstanding out of a total available facility of 111m at 31 December 2002.
During 2003 500m of loans will be maturing which in addition to various bonds and notes includes the 100m of FRPS and 95m from the receivables securitisation programme.
These are expected to be refinanced through new debt issues.
On 17 June 2002 ICI announced it had reached an agreement with Matlin Patterson Global Opportunities Partners L.
HIH for 440m 283m.
Of this amount 160m 109m has been received.
The remaining 280m 174m will be payable on 15 May 2003 with the purchaser having the option to pay all or part of the amount due prior to 15 May 2003 by means of installment payments.
Other than the 160m 109m already received sums due from the purchaser carry interest from May 2002 to the date of payment.
Pensions
Despite significant movements in the worlds equity markets as at 31 March 2002 the estimated solvency of the ICI UK Pension Fund ICIs largest defined benefit scheme representing approximately 87% of the Groups retirement benefit schemes by asset value and in projected benefit terms was not significantly changed from the level two years ago when the last actuarial valuation took place.
Over the last five years the ICI Pension Funds Trustee Board has steadily reduced exposure to equities.
The final phase of this switch in late 2000 and early 2001 was particularly well timed.
At 31 December 2002 over 75% of the Funds assets were invested in fixed income securities which should reduce volatility in the market value of the Fund.
Based on the last actuarial valuation at 31 March 2000 ICI continues to pay additional contributions into the Fund of 30m per year until 31 March 2006 to cover past funding shortfalls.
The next triennial actuarial valuation is due to take place at 31 March 2003.
