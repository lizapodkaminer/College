CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW
Financial performance The 2017 financial year delivered profitable growth with passenger numbers increasing by 18.9 per cent. onyear to 23.8 million.
The trading environment experienced in FY 2017 of very low fares and increasing fuel prices unquestionably favoured our ultralowcost business model and we were able to increase our growth rate strengthen our number one position in CEE and also maintain one of the highest profit margins of any European carrier.
Our market leading position with the combination of one of the highest growth rates and profit margins of all European airlines makes Wizz Air one of the most exciting airline businesses in Europe.
Operating the most efficient aircraft with the latest technology has always been a key foundation stone of Wizz Airs ultralow cost base.
Our fleet currently has an average age of just 4.4 years one of the youngest in
We continue to build on that foundation with a delivery stream of brand new A321ceo aircraft which deliver double digit cost savings compared to A320ceo aircraft.
At the end of FY 2017 we operated 16 A321ceo aircraft representing a quarter of the airlines seat capacity which gives us a clear cost advantage compared to most of our rivals.
The resilience of our ultralow cost business model which we are convinced is the best model for stimulating air travel in CEE combined with our growing diversified network and our ever stronger balance sheet places Wizz Air in a unique position to exploit the significant market opportunity that exists in a market of over 300 million people.
Our strong performance was driven by capacity expansion higher load factors higher passenger growth and continued improvements to our industryleading ultralowcost base.
In numbers we delivered ticket revenues that increased by 2.3 per cent. ancillary revenue that increased by 22.7 per cent. total airline unit cost that decreased by 7.8 per cent. a 19.7 per cent. an increase in our average load factor by 1.9 percentage points to 90.1 per cent. despite significant capacity expansion.
Strategic progress The Company is convinced that its strategy of building on its strong network highly efficient model compelling customer proposition solid finances and sound risk management policies will enable it to deliver sustainable growth and returns for Shareholders.
Wizz Airs management team enforces rigorous cost control in all aspects of the Groups business and has created a companywide business culture that is keenly focused on driving costs lower.
The Company believes that this cost advantage protects Wizz Airs market position enables it to offer some of the lowest ticket prices in its markets stimulates demand in its markets and supports continued profitable growth.
With its ultralowcost structure innovative unbundled pricing strategy leading market position among low cost carriers in CEE and track record of expansion in CEE and beyond the Company believes that it is well positioned to continue to grow profitably.
Wizz Airs infrastructure including personnel processes systems and relationships with suppliers of outsourced services is scalable and sufficiently flexible to support Wizz Airs growth plans.
The Company believes that Wizz Air is a pioneering airline in the markets in which it operates by seeking to bring the lowcost carrier concept and Western European aviation standards into currently underserved new Eastern markets and is at the forefront of airline innovation in these new markets.
Wizz Air has a strong track record of working with regulators to develop appropriate regulatory structures in nonEU countries.
Wizz Air has been able to leverage the knowhow market understanding and cultural awareness of its senior management team and employees to build strong relationships with airport operators suppliers governments and regulators in new markets and is able to present itself as a reliable partner that to date has never exited from a country where it has established an operating base.

CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW CONTINUED
Strengthened leadership in CEE Wizz Air continues to be the clear market leader in Central and Eastern Europe maintaining our market share of over 39 per cent. of lowcost airline traffic.
The expansion of our network with 113 new routes launched in FY 2017 has allowed us to strengthen our position reaching new customers throughout the region.
Today we operate in 19 of the 21 CEE countries serving the market by offering a network of 28 bases and 141 destinations in 42 countries.
With a low propensity to travel and lowcost market penetration currently at 40.4 per cent. and we continue to believe that the ultralowcost business model is best placed to serve this market.
Wherever we operate Wizz Air brings safe reliable operations low fares hasslefree services and a distinctive brand designed to appeal to the whole market.
As a result Wizz Airs aggregate market share in CEE was 39.1 per cent. the number one or number two lowcost airline in all but one of our CEE base countries.

CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW CONTINUED
Strengthened leadership in CEE continued The Company offers services from 19 CEE countries including the 14 CEE countries where it has base aircraft and crews.
The Company opened four new CEE bases and started flights from further four new CEE airports in the 2017 financial year as well as ten new destinations outside of CEE as follows New CEE stations New stations outside CEE City Country City Country Podgorica Montenegro Hanover Germany OlsztynMazury Poland Lamezia Terme Italy Satu Mare Romania Eilat  Ovda Israel Suceava Romania Lanzarote Spain Fuerteventura Spain Ibiza Spain Santander Spain Porto Portugal Vxj Sweden London Gatwick UK Fleet development securing longterm growth During the 2017 financial year we continued to invest significantly in our fleet by adding twelve A321ceo aircraft taking our fleet to 79 aircraft at the end of March 2017.
Deliveries of the A321ceo commenced in November 2015 and in just 18 months we are already operating 16 of the type representing 24.5 per cent. of the Companys total seat capacity.
We are excited about the cost savings we are seeing from the A321ceo aircraft and the continued rollout of these aircraft across our network is expected to further improve our cost base and competitive edge.
The composition of our fleet at the end of the 2017 financial year and currently anticipated at the end of the next two financial years is as follows March 2017 March 2018 March 2019 Actual Planned Planned A320ceo without winglets 180 seats 35 35 28 A320ceo with winglets 180 seats 28 28 28 A320ceo with winglets 186 seats  3 9 A321ceo with winglets 230 seats 16 25 31 A321neo with winglets 239 seats   3 Fleet size 79 91 99 Share of fleet with winglets 55.7% 61.5% 71.7% Average number of seats per aircraft 190 194 198
In FY 2016 the Company concluded a purchase agreement with Airbus for 110 firmorder A321neo aircraft and purchase rights for a further 90 of the type.
During the 2017 financial year the Company selected and contracted Pratt and Whitneys new technology geared turbofan engines to power these aircraft.
We anticipate that based on the estimates of both Airbus and Pratt and Whitney the A321neo will deliver significantly better fuel burn efficiency and even lower unit costs compared to the ceo version making it the perfect aircraft to underpin the Companys ambitious growth plans and replace older aircraft as they are returned to lessors.
Our first A321neo is scheduled to be delivered in 2019 and deliveries will continue until the end of 2024.
The purchase agreement includes uncommitted purchase rights for 90 additional A321neo aircraft as well as certain conversion rights to receive the smaller A320neo providing the flexibility needed to match aircraft deliveries with the Companys capacity needs.
Based on our current order book with Airbus and lessor return schedule our fleet will nearly double in size from the end of FY 2017 to the end of FY 2024.
Improving the customer experience New routes and base operations We launched 113 new routes during the 2017 financial year taking our route network to 486 routes from 28 bases connecting 141 destinations in 42 countries at the end of March 2017.
Our markets are also reacting very well to the emergence of air travel within CEE with the Company launching 13 new routes connecting CEE countries in FY 2017.
This trend is continuing into FY 2018 with the Company commencing operations on five previously unserved Western Balkan routes between Budapest and Kosovo Montenegro Bosnia and Herzegovina Macedonia and Albania.
In addition to connecting CEE countries we are also experiencing significant demand on the two domestic routes launched in Romania and Bulgaria.

CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW CONTINUED
Improving the customer experience continued Offering our customers more We know that our customers welcome the opportunity to fly at Wizz Airs lowest prices yet experience the great onboard service provided by our dedicated crew.
We also know that many of our customers also welcome the opportunity to tailor their travel experience to their requirements by adding additional services.
We took a look at what our customers are buying and decided to make it easier and cheaper for them to buy some of the most popular additional services together with the WIZZ Go bundle which offers a discount over the Basic Fare and the prices of the included additional services when bought separately.
Many of our customers are loyal Wizz Air fans who fly with us on multiple occasions each year.
Our Wizz Discount Club enables our most loyal customers and their friends and families to benefit from even lower fares than normal throughout the year.
No wonder its popular membership of the Wizz Discount Club reached 1.05 million members by the end of the 2017 financial year representing a 29 per cent. the 2016 financial year.
Our customers have always enjoyed the convenience of being able to book accommodation and car hire along with other travel servicessite But demonstrating our commitment always to give our customers more for less we launched our own inclusive package tour operator Wizz Tours in 2015.
The opportunity to book flights and accommodation at the same time in a single package and at a discounted price is proving increasingly popular  Wizz Tours revenues increased fourfold to 18.1 million in the 2017 financial year.
None of this means that weve taken any less interest in ancillary revenue though which continues to be a very important part of the Companys business model.
For the financial year ended 31 March 2017 total ancillary revenues represented 41.8 per cent of overall airline revenue up from 37.4 percent in the previous financial year. rollout in May and August.
The new responsive design caters for the needs of Wizz Airs young and mobile savvy audience through a clean and fast onepage booking process.
The introduction of our unique threeclick express booking functionality enables an even faster booking experience.
Throughout the year hundreds of major and minor digital optimizations contributed to a record high conversion rate on ticket and ancillary sales.
With a website now available in 24 languages and 11 on the app Wizz Air served over 200 million sessions to more than 50 million users.
Wizz Air is the eighth most visited airline website in the world with one of the highest 56% share of mobile visitors.
Our mobile app user base more than doubled to 3.7 million users in FY 2017.
With 1.8 million followers on Facebook Wizz Air has by far most fans per available seat among its peers in Europe.
New digital initiatives in the next financial year will further strengthen the engagement with our ever more connected customers.
Balanced hedging approach Wizz Air operates under a clear set of treasury policies approved by the Board and supervised by the Audit Committee.
The aim of our hedging policy is to reduce shortterm volatility in earnings and liquidity.
Therefore Wizz Air hedges a minimum of 50 per cent of the projected US Dollar and jet fuel requirements for the next twelve months 40 per cent on an 18month hedge horizon.
Recently the Company started to hedge it largest nonEUR revenue currency GBP against EUR in order to smooth out potential future volatility due to Brexit.
Unlike for the US Dollar there is no minimum coverage set while the maximum is 60% of projected net GBP exposure on rolling twelvemonth basis.

Prehedging a 10 per metric ton movement in the price of jet fuel impacts the 2018 financial year fuel costs by 8.3 million.
In the Companys view the profit impact of such changes is likely to be less given the empirical evidence of major industrywide movements in input costs being passed through to air fares with a lag of twelve to eighteen months.
Management changes There were a number of management changes throughout the year.
John Stephenson the Groups Executive Vice President and Gyorgy Abran Chief Commercial Officer stepped down from their positions in August 2016.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank John and Gyorgy for their significant contribution they have made to the Company over the last 1012 years respectively.
They played a central role in building Wizz Air into the leading low cost carrier in CEE and one of the strongest airlines in Europe.
We wish them all the best in the future.
As announced earlier in the year Sonia Jerez Burdeus stepped down from her position of Chief Financial Officer in order to relocate back to Spain.
I would like to thank her once again for her contribution during the time that she was with us.
We are making good progress in recruiting her replacement and will make a further announcement in due course.
During the 2017 financial year George Michalopoulos Chief Commercial Officer and Jozsef Ujhelyi Chief Flight Operations Officer were promoted to their current roles and Diederik Pen was promoted to become Executive Vice President and Chief Operations Officer reflecting the importance of the Operations function to the success of Wizz Air.

Outlook
2018 financial year In FY2018 growth continues as a top priority with increase in capacity by around 23% targeting to carry nearly 30 million passengers.
The Company recorded a strong start to FY2018 due to the timing of Easter and although still at an early stage of the financial year currently the Group net profit is expected to be in a range between 250 million and 270 million in FY2018.
This guidance is heavily caveated by the revenue performance for the allimportant summer period as well as the second half of FY2018 a period for which the Company currently have limited visibility.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
During the 2017 financial year Wizz Air carried 23.8 million passengers an 18.9 per cent. the previous year.
Revenue grew to 1571.2 million representing a 9.9 per cent. previous year.
Wizz Air recorded a balanced capacity growth measured in terms of available seat kilometres ASK of 19.7 per cent. and seats of 16.4 per cent.
As indicated throughout the 2017 financial year most airlines including Wizz Air added capacity in response to lower fuel prices.
During the 2017 financial year Wizz Air collected ca.
20% of its revenues in British Pounds which leading up to the UK referendum to leave the European Union and right after the actual vote has devalued significantly against the Euro.
In addition the peculiarity of the 2017 financial year was that both Easter holidays of 2016 and 2017 calendar years fell outside of the 2017 financial year resulting in related additional revenues materializing in the 2016 and 2018 financial years.
The combined effect of the above mentioned events resulted in revenue per ASK decreasing by 8.5 per cent. in 2017 compared to the previous financial year.
Despite the UKs decision to leave the European Union Brexit there are no signs of demand weakness on routes tofrom the UK.
The negative translation effect on British pound revenues due to Brexit in the 2017 financial year is estimated at 17 million which was partially offset by the positive translation effect on British pound costs.
The Company continues to examine the terms on which Brexit might materialize the potential implications of these to Wizz Airs business and take actions that are considered necessary.
Unit costs further improved as lower fuel prices complemented by a healthy fuel hedging position resulted in fuel unit cost per ASK declining 21.9 per cent.
This combined with another strong performance on nonfuel cost which declined 0.6 per cent. delivered a total unit cost decline of 7.8 per cent.
The profit for the year was 246.0 million and included a 20.7 million net gain from unrealised FX gains and exceptional items.
These comprised unrealised foreign exchange gains of 1.9 million and a gain from the change in the time value of hedge positions of 14.3 million and a 4.5 million net gain on fuel caps sold before expiry.
The income tax expense for the year was 9.8 million 2016 8.5 million giving an effective tax rate for the Group of 3.8 per cent.
2016 4.2 per cent.
The main components of this charge are local business tax and innovation tax paid in Hungary and corporate income tax paid in Switzerland.
Underlying profit after tax increased by 0.6 per cent. to 225.3 million in 2017 from 223.9 million in 2016.

The proforma underlying earnings per share EPS is a fully diluted measure defined by the Company.
Its calculation differs from the IFRS diluted EPS measure in the following for earnings the underlying profit for the year is used as opposed to the statutory IFRS profit for the year and for the fully diluted number of shares the yearend position was taken rather than the weighted average for the year.
Starting from the 2017 financial year the Company introduced separate reporting for its airline and tour operator business units.
Where a measure is reported for a business unit as opposed to the Group as a whole then this fact is explicitly stated.
All other measures and statements relate to the Group as a whole.

FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
Return on capital employed and capital structure ROCE is a nonstatutory performance measure commonly used to measure the financial returns that a business achieves on the capital it uses.
ROCE for the 2017 financial year was 17.6 per cent. and tax EBIT shareholders equity net cash position and capitalised leases.
The Companys leverage defined as net debt adjusted to include capitalised operating lease obligations divided by earnings before interest tax depreciation amortisation and aircraft rentals EBITDAR fell to a ratio of 1.7 from 1.4 at the end of the 2017 financial year.
The yearonyear comparisons of ROCE and leverage were negatively impacted by the translation effect of the stronger US Dollar compared to last year as capitalised US dollar aircraft leases are translated into a higher Euro value.
Liquidity defined as cash and equivalents as a percentage of the last twelve months revenue rose from 45.2 per cent. at the end of the 2016 financial year to 49.3 per cent. a year later.

Financial performance Starting from 2017 revenues and operating expenses are analysed by business segment compared to the same measures for the 2016 financial year.
In the 2016 Annual Report these analyses were done for the Group as a whole.
Therefore revenues certain expenses and certain KPIs for 2016 for the Airline are different in this report from the corresponding numbers presented in the 2016 report for the Group.
The remaining measures financial income and expenses taxation other comprehensive income and expense are continued to be analysed for the Group as the share of the tour operator business unit is immaterial or nil in these measures.

Percentage of total revenue

Passenger ticket revenue 909.3 58.2% 893.5 62.6% 1.8% Ancillary revenue 652.7 41.8% 533.8 37.4% 22.3% Total revenue 1562.0 100% 1427.4 100% 9.4% The decline in RASK by 8.5 per cent. cent. to 909.3 million while ancillary or nonticket revenue increased by 22.3 per cent. to 652.7 million.
Average revenue per passenger decreased from 71.4 in 2016 to 65.7 in 2017 a decrease of 8.0 per cent which helped stimulate more passenger volumes.
Average passenger ticket revenue per passenger declined from 44.7 in 2016 to 38.3 14.4 per cent.
26.7 in 2016 to 27.5 in 2017 an increase of 0.8 per passenger or 2.8 per cent.
This slight decrease in average revenue per passenger was due to a decrease in average passenger ticket revenue per passenger in 2017 compared to 2016 which was the result of lower input prices feeding into lower fares even though load factors increased by 1.9 percentage points to 90.1% and the combined impact of the modification of certain products the introduction of new services Go Fare and the adaptation of customers to some of the longer standing products such as allocated seating and different checkedin luggage sizes.
Airline operating expenses Total airline operating expenses increased by 10.3 per cent.
2016.
Airline CASK declined by 7.8 per cent. to 3.15 Euro cents in 2017 from 3.42 Euro cents in 2016.
This reduction in CASK was principally driven by a reduction in the average fuel price and continued improvement of the airport mix.
CASK excluding fuel expenses decreased to 2.25 Euro cents in 2017 from 2.27 Euro cents in 2016 driven by the combined effect of further improvement of major cost items maintenance airport handling and enroute charges set off by increasing aircraft rentals.

The increase in overall staff costs reflected a 15.7 per cent. compared to the previous year as certain profitability targets were not reached.
Fuel expenses decreased by 6.6 per cent. to 375.2 million in 2017 down from 401.5 million in 2016.
Although there was an increase of 19.7 per cent. growth in ASKs and an 8.0 per cent. a 1.6 per cent. reduction in fuel consumption per block hour and a 25.2 per cent. price after hedging.
The average fuel price including hedging impact and intoplane premium paid by Wizz Air in 2017 was US553 per ton a decline of 25.2 per cent. from the previous years figure of US740 per ton.
Distribution and marketing costs rose 16.0 per cent. to 27.0 million in 2017 from 23.3 million in 2016.
This increase is modestly lower than the passenger growth of 18.9 per cent. during the same period.
Maintenance materials and repair costs decreased by 3.6 per cent. in 2016.
This cost decrease was the combined result of several renegotiated maintenance contracts with third party providers and the timing of certain maintenance events.
Aircraft rental costs increased 32.8 per cent. to 233.9 million in 2017 from 176.2 million in 2016.
This increase was largely due to fleet growth equivalent aircraft expanded by 15.3 per cent. per cent. stronger than the previous year after hedging impact.
Airport handling and enroute charges increased by 13.7 per cent. in 2016.
This category comprised 224.2 million of airport and handling fees and 165.8 million of enroute and navigation charges in 2017 and 193.9 million of airport and handling fees and 149.3 million of enroute and navigation charges in 2016.
The cost increase was primarily due to a 12.9 per cent. flights and an 18.9 per cent. rise in passenger numbers.
Depreciation and amortisation charges increased by 99.9 per cent. programs are required.
See Note 13 to the financial statements for more details.
Other expenses increased by 12.3 per cent. to 43.6 million in 2017 from 38.8 million in 2016.
Other expenses include cancellation and delay related costs of 12.2 million an increase of 92.5 per cent yearonyear.
The
European airline industry is experiencing a significant increase in customer compensation costs  to levels that the Company believes is disproportionate to the Companys very low fares especially as the Company only cancelled 214 flights out of a total of 141698 flights in the financial year.
With the exception of cancellation and delay related costs the Company delivered a strong cost performance on all other areas in this line item.
Airline operating profit As a result of the foregoing factors the Airline made an operating profit in respect of its airlines operations of 247.4 million in 2017 a 4.8 per cent. increase from the operating profit of 236.1 million made in 2016.

Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2017 22 STRATEGIC REPORT
FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
Financial performance continued Net financing income and expense The Groups net financing income resulted in a net gain of 9.1 million in 2017 after an expense of 34.1 million in 2016.
This significant change was driven primarily by the change in the time value of hedges with the net impact of all other items being limited as shown in the table below million 2017 2016 Change Net FXrelated impacts including exceptional item in 2016 2.6 3.1 5.7 Change in time value of hedges exceptional 14.3 25.0 39.3 Fuel cap impacts including exceptional item in 2017 4.5 5.3 0.9 All other financial income and expenses net recurring 3.3 0.7 2.7 Net financing income and expense 9.1 34.1 43.2 See also Notes 9 and 10 to the financial statements.
Changes in the time value of hedges as accounted for under IAS 39 resulted in significant gains and losses in the two years respectively.
Such changes will stop impacting earnings from the 2018 financial year as the Group adopted IFRS 9 from 1 April 2017.
Fuel caps impacted the two years similarly after taking into account for 2017 the oneoff impacts of the closure of caps in September 2016.
By that date all caps expired or were sold so there will be no further impacts from these instruments in future years.
The remaining recurring items had relatively limited impacts.
The 2.7 million higher net financial income and expenses in 2017 was caused by i the lower interest yield environment ii some gains in 2016 coming from ineffective fuel hedges and iii the net impact of discounting longterm financial assets.
Taxation
The Group recorded an income tax expense of 9.8 million in 2017 slightly higher than the 8.5 million in 2016.
The effective tax rate for the Group was 3.8 per cent. in 2017 and 4.2 per cent. in 2016.
The reduction in the effective tax rate reflects the impact of Hungarian local taxes the tax base of which is different from the corporate tax base  particularly given that financial income and expenses are not in the scope of these taxes.
Profit for the year As a result of the foregoing factors the Group generated an IFRS profit for 2017 of 246.0 million a 27.5 per cent. increase from the profit of 192.9 million in 2016.
Other comprehensive income and expense In 2017 the Group had other comprehensive income of 15.5 million compared to 33.2 million in 2016.
This change was driven by the movements in the balance of the cash flow hedging reserve in equity in the two years.
This situation arises when based on the spot prices at year end there is an overall more favourable position on the Groups open hedge instruments than a year before.
Cash flows and financial position Summary statement of cash flows The following table sets out selected cash flow data and the Companys cash and cash equivalents for 2017 and 2016 million 2017 2016 Change Net cash generated by operating activities 310.9 288.9 22.0 Net cash used in investing activities 179.7 90.6 89.1 Net cash used in financing activities 1.8 1.7 0.1 Effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash and cash equivalents 1.0 0.5 1.5 Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year 774.0 645.6 128.5 Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2017 23 STRATEGIC REPORT
FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
Cash flows and financial position continued Cash flow from operating activities The vast majority of Wizz Airs cash inflows from operating activities are derived from passenger ticket sales.
Net cash flows from operating activities are also materially affected by movements in working capital items.
Operating cash flows improved from 288.9 million in 2016 to 310.9 million in 2017 primarily due to the following factors Profit before tax and depreciation Profit before tax in 2017 was 54.4 million higher than in 2016.
However this increase in the profits was almost exclusively due to the impacts from financial income and expense items that are noncash.
It is for similar reasons that on an underlying basis there was only a small increase in profits from 2016 to 2017 as shown earlier.
On the other hand depreciation and amortisation expenses were 28.8 million higher in 2017  this almost alone explains the 29.0 million increase in operating cash flows before adjusting for changes in working capital.
Changes in working capital The movements in working capital items helped the 2016 operating cash flows by 20.7 million while the same impact was only 14.1 million for 2017.
This is a relatively small difference between the two years when compared to the absolute size of the respective asset and liability balances.
There are two differences between the two years that are worth noting as contributors i the restricted cash balance increased by 20.8 million more during 2017 than in 2016 and ii the trade and other payables balance increased by 25.2 million less during 2017 than in 2016 primarily because the increase in 2016 was particularly high.
Cash flow from investing activities Net cash used in investing activities increased by 89.1 million from a net cash outflow of 90.6 million in 2016 to a net cash outflow of 179.7 million in 2017.
There are three contributors to the higher investments in 2017 Aircraft maintenance assets There was 35.0 million more invested into aircraft maintenance assets in 2017 than in 2016 caused primarily by the increase in the number of engine LLP replacements performed in the year there was one such event in 2016 and nine in 2017.
Purchases of tangible assets The Group invested 25.7 million more into tangible assets in 2017 than in 2016 due primarily to more spare engines being purchased.
Advances paid for aircraft pre delivery payments PDP The net PDP flows payments paid to Airbus less refunds received required 28.3 million more cash investment in 2017 than in 2016.
Cash flow from financing activities Net cash used in financing activities were immaterial and increased by only 0.1 million to a 1.8 million outflow in 2017 from a 1.7 million outflow in 2016.

FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
Summary statement of balance sheet continued Property plant and equipment increased by 152.1 million as at 31 March 2017 compared to 31 March 2016 see Note 13 to the financial statements.
This was driven by investments in all the important fixed asset categories as follows i the gross book value of aircraft maintenance assets including advances paid for these assets increased by 87.7 million mainly due to more engines being out of condition under the respective lease contract at the end of 2017 than a year before ii PDPs increased by 64.0 million due to the growing number of aircraft deliveries and their respective payments as well as the relatively higher PDP of the A321ceo compared to the A320ceo and iii investment into aircraft parts in the amount of 37.3 million with most of this related to the delivery of several spare engines during the year.
Restricted cash current and noncurrent increased by 54.2 million as at 31 March 2017 compared to 31 March 2016.
This was driven by the growth in the amount of leaserelated letters of credit particularly as security in relation to future maintenance obligations.
Derivative financial instruments current and noncurrent increased by 8.4 million as at 31 March 2017 compared to 31 March 2016 see Notes 3 and 20 to the financial statements.
The receivable from open hedge instruments at the end of 2016 was close to nil rather there were payable positions see below but at the end of 2017 there were few million Euro receivables both on the open foreign exchange and fuel hedges.
Trade and other receivables current and noncurrent increased by 11.0 million as at 31 March 2017 compared to 31 March 2016 see Note 18 to the financial statements.
Cash and cash equivalents increased by 128.4 million as at 31 March 2017 compared to 31 March 2016.
This change is explained in detail in the cash flow analysis above.
Trade and other payables increased by 20.4 million as at 31 March 2017 compared to 31 March 2016.
This rate of increase is broadly consistent with rate of increase for the Groups business during the year.
Deferred income current and noncurrent increased by 67.2 million as at 31 March 2017 compared to 31 March 2016 see Note 26 to the financial statements.
This was driven primarily by the increase in unflown revenues 52.3 million itself primarily due to the increase in offered seat capacity and to a smaller extent by the concessions received from aircraft and component manufacturers during the year.
Derivative financial liabilities current and noncurrent decreased by 15.8 million as at 31 March 2017 compared to 31 March 2016 see Notes 3 and 20 to the financial statements.
At the end of 2016 the Group had primarily payable positions and only very small receivables in relation to its open foreign exchange and fuel hedge instruments but this situation reversed by the end of 2017 having primarily receivables on both foreign exchange and fuel with only very small fuelrelated payables.
Provisions current and noncurrent increased by 28.8 million as at 31 March 2017 compared to 31 March 2016 see Note 29 to the financial statements.
The increase relates primarily to new provisions made for future heavy maintenance events particularly engine LLP replacements.

The Companys success to date reflects not only its ability to identify and capitalise upon opportunities but also its ability to react and deal effectively with risks and challenges.
The aviation industry is one where reputations and businesses can be lost quickly if a risk is not anticipated and dealt with effectively and the Company is committed to ensuring that it employs best practice in order to identify and mitigate risks as best it can.
This section of the annual report sets out our risk management process as well as a short description of some of the key risks that could if not properly dealt with affect Wizz Airs future success although it does not by any means list all risks that might possibly affect our business.
Risk management is itself a dynamic and developing area and the Company understands that what was appropriate and adequate in the past may not continue to be so as the Company continues to grow.
The Directors will therefore continue to review risk management on an ongoing basis to ensure that the processes used in the Company remain appropriate and adequate.
Our risk management process The Board oversees the Companys risk process and has delegated authority for this to the Audit Committee.
The Companys Head of Internal Audit reports directly to the Chairman of the Audit Committee.
Each year a risk universe exercise is undertaken by the Head of Internal Audit with the Companys senior and operational management.
The results of this exercise are used to produce an Internal Audit plan for the coming year.
The
Internal Audit plan generally always covers internal control risks as well as some other enterprise risks.
Senior management reports to the Board at each of the scheduled Board meetings and the Board also received a report from the Chairman of the Audit Committee at each of the scheduled Board meetings.
These reports include detailed assessment of for example commercial and operational risks which may have arisen or been dealt with during the reporting period.
In addition the Board is kept updated by senior management as and when specific risk issues arise between Board meetings.
To date the Companys small administrative headcount has ensured that consideration of risk has enjoyed close oversight in relation to daytoday matters by the Companys senior management.
The Board however recognised that as the Company continues to grow quickly a more structured process of risk management was required.
Some areas of the Companys business have always had sophisticated risk analysis and mitigation processes in place.
For example the Companys flight operations are subject to a worldclass risk assessment and mitigation programme and the Companys exposure to foreign exchange and fuel price changes is mitigated through a Boardapproved hedging programme administered by the Audit Committee.
Risks and internal controls relating to financial reporting were subject to a detailed and comprehensive analysis as part of the Companys preparations for its initial public offering in March 2015.
For other areas however a comprehensive enterprise risk management ERM process appropriate for the Companys business was developed and implemented by management during the course of the 2017 financial year working with Ernst and Young and overseen by the Audit Committee.
Following the completion and implementation of the ERM process the Company has a more robust process in place to review and monitor both existing and new risks that may arise.
In order to ensure that the principles and methodology underpinning the ERM process and the ERM manual enjoyed a common understanding throughout the Company a comprehensive and practical training programme was rolled out across the Company from senior management down with the actual training being tailored to each colleagues position in the risk management process.
A formal internal Risk Council was established involving the Companys senior management team and a number of other senior employees on a regular basis to consider and update the risks identified in the risk universe.
The new ERM methodology was then used to assess these various risks with the relevant risk owners on either a quantitative or qualitative basis as appropriate.
The outcome of the ERM methodology employed for each risk leads to a decision as to whether to transfer avoid reduce or accept the particular risk.
The resulting principal risk report was then reviewed with the Audit Committee and presented to the Board.
The principal risk report will be comprehensively reviewed by the Risk Council at least every quarter and will form the basis of regular specific risk reports to the Audit Committee with any changes to the principal risk report and emerging risks being highlighted.
These key risks many of which were already the subject of regular reporting and discussion between senior management and the Board are detailed below.
In addition and as part of the Companys regular midterm planning process management has where appropriately measurable provided financial models of the possible effects of some of these key risks to the Board.
The Board is therefore satisfied that it has carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Company including those that would threaten its business model future performance solvency or liquidity.
Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2017 27 STRATEGIC REPORT PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES CONTINUED Our risk management process continued The Board also reviewed the effectiveness of the risk management and internal control systems of the Company.
The following action points were defined and implemented i a more formal communication and reporting line between the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the Head of Internal Audit was setup and ii in order to give more time for the proper review of the outcome of internal audits and to followup on any issues raised additional meetings of the Committee are being held during the year focusing on internal audit matters.
The new ERM system enhances and develops the Companys risk management activities and internal control processes and puts them in a framework appropriate not only for the coming year but the coming decade.
Risks relating to the Group
The key risks identified by the Risk Committee fall into six broad groupings information technology and cyber risk including website availability protection of our own and our customers data and ensuring the availability of operationscritical systems external factors such as the default of a partner financial institution fuel cost foreign exchange rates competition and geopolitical risk product development making sure that we are making the best use of our capacity and ensuring that we have access to the right airport infrastructure at the right price so that we can keep on delivering the superior Wizz Air service at low fares across an ever wider network fleet development to ensure the Company has the right number of aircraft available at the right time to take advantage of commercial opportunities and grow in a disciplined way regulatory risk ensuring that we remain compliant with regulations affecting our business and operations operations including safety events and terrorist incidents and human resources ensuring we are able to recruit the right number of colleagues of the right quality to continue to grow or once recruited that they remain sufficiently engaged and motivated and ensuring that the Company has appropriate succession management for key colleagues in place.
Information technology and cyber risk Wizz Air is primarily an ebusiness.
During the 2017 financial year 95 per cent. through our website and mobile applications.
We are therefore dependent on our information technology systems to receive process and manage ticket reservations process credit and debit card payments check in passengers manage our traffic network perform flight operations and engage in other critical business tasks.
Our website is our shop window and therefore it is critical that it is secure and reliable.
We outsource the hosting and operation of these systems to a number of IT suppliers.
However we retain an experienced internal team to oversee the operation of these systems and include suitable contractual recovery and other key performance standards with each of our key IT suppliers.
We have also increased the number of card acquirers and payment service providers that we use with each provider being an effective backup for the others.
We will continue to review our businesscritical systems to ensure that the appropriate level of backup is in place.
The Company has employed business continuity processes since its beginning and our existing processes and procedures ensure that key staff can be relocated to an alternative location should our normal offices become unusable.
As a project for the 2018 financial year these business continuity processes will be comprehensively reviewed and where necessary updated to ensure that they remain appropriate and sufficient for the Companys continued growth.
Cyber risk is a hugely important consideration for a business such as ours and is one of the areas on which specific work has been done with the Board over the last year.
Our systems could be attacked in a number of ways and with varying outcomes  for example unavailability of our website or operationscritical systems or theft of our customers data.
Quite apart from immediate commercial loss any loss of customer data is likely to result in considerable loss of confidence of our customers.
Cyber security is a constantly evolving challenge and one of the key issues related to cyber security is our colleagues awareness of the risk and of the possible ways in which our business could be attacked and therefore a comprehensive and compulsory elearning training course for all colleagues has been implemented.
Our inhouse IT security department will continue to review emerging threats and the Board will be kept up to date on the actions being taken by the Company to safeguard its systems.
More generally protection of both our own and our customers data remains a key issue.
The Company is preparing itself for the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation in May 2018 through a crossfunctional working group which will review the Companys existing comprehensive data protection processes and policies.
The Board will be kept updated on the Companys preparations for this step change in the Companys data protection obligations.
Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2017 28 STRATEGIC REPORT PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES CONTINUED Risks relating to the Group continued External risks We are a truly international business and while we report in Euros we transact in 20 currencies.
We also have to make a large number of payments in US Dollars.
Appreciation of the US Dollar against the Euro may impact results and margins.
Therefore to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations in respect of costs incurred in US Dollars we engage in EuroUS Dollar hedging in accordance with a Boardapproved hedging policy.
In addition and recognising the importance of the Pound Sterling as accounting for around 20 per cent. course of the 2017 financial year to allow for the possibility of hedging Pound Sterling against the Euro.
In all cases hedging transactions are subject to the approval of the Audit Committee.
Fuel accounted for 28.3 per cent. of our total Group operating cost in the 2017 financial year.
A rise in fuel prices could significantly affect our operating costs.
We therefore hedge our aviation fuel cost in accordance with a Boardapproved hedging policy.
The Audit Committee is involved in and approves each hedging decision.
In the past few years Wizz Air has seen its cash reserves increase considerably.
We believe that a strong cash position is a vital foundation for the Companys continued aggressive growth and ability to deal with andor take advantage of competitive situations when they arise.
However the security of our cash and the financial strength of our hedging counterparties is something that we actively manage.
In particular all of the Companys cash is invested in accordance with a Boardapproved counterparty risk policy which assigns certain investment limits for each counterparty based upon its credit rating.
Competition is one of the key risks to our business.
The airline industry in Europe is fiercely competitive.
We have yet to see consolidation on the scale experienced in for example the United States and so there are a large number of airlines including ultralowcost and lowcost carriers traditional airlines and charter airlines competing throughout our network.
Our competitors may seek to protect or gain market share in markets in which we operate perhaps by offering discounted fares or more attractive schedules.
We believe that competition is good for the industry  both for consumers who benefit from lower prices as well as airlines themselves as they must embrace cost discipline  but we must react to a competitive threat.
Ultimately our key competitive strength is our commitment to driving our cost ever lower while delivering a superior customer service.
We firmly believe that in a tough market lowest cost ultimately wins and the necessary cost discipline is something to which we are committed day in day out.
Competition can however adversely affect revenues and so we constantly monitor our competitors actions and the performance of our route network to ensure that we take both reactive and proactive actions in a timely manner as required.
We are exposed to political and economic events and trends in CEE and elsewhere.
Our business extends beyond the borders of the EU and into countries such as Russia Turkey and Ukraine and regions including the Caucasus North Africa and the Middle East.
These and other countries in the region have experienced and may still be subject to potential political and economic instability caused by changes in governments political deadlock in the legislative process contested election results tension and conflict between federal and regional authorities corruption among governmental officials social and ethnic unrest and currency instability.
We maintain close relationships with local authorities and as an organisation we are able to react quickly to adverse events.
Like all European airlines we have prospered in a liberalised regulatory environment which makes the free movement of people throughout the European Union a reality.
Any event which adversely affects either the liberalised operating environment or the free movement of people has the potential to affect our business.
As with all airlines in Europe the outcome of the Brexit vote has created significant uncertainty for our business.
While demand on our routes to and from the United Kingdom has not weakened the weakness of the Pound Sterling following the Brexit vote has adversely affected the Euro value of the revenue.
However the most critical issue facing the Company and all European airlines is the lack of clarity on how the Brexit negotiations will affect access to the liberalised market between the United Kingdom and the rest of the European Union.
Wizz Air firmly believes that the liberalised air market has significant benefits for both the United Kingdom and the European Union and urges all parties to settle as a matter of priority on the continuation of access to the liberalised market.
However whatever the outcome and while we continue to have a strong United Kingdom business we have always believed that diversification of our network and our customers is a key part of a sustainable business.
That remains the case and we are confident that there remains a large addressable market in CEE which will continue to provide opportunities for profitable growth should our UK business be adversely affected.
Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2017 29 STRATEGIC REPORT PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES CONTINUED Risks relating to the Group continued Product development We do not just compete for customers we compete for access to infrastructure too.
Wizz Air enjoys high growth  but as we grow we need more terminal space slots and aircraft parking to be able to operate our flights.
Certain airports to which we operate may already be or become congested meaning we may not be able to secure access to those airports at our preferred times and therefore when we have slots we need to make sure that we retain them.
We mitigate this risk by operating primarily from secondary airports which have significant spare capacity and where we do fly to congested airports our flights often constitute in bound traffic for such airports and take up offpeak capacity.
However we ensure that we maintain close working relationships with relevant airport authorities and slot coordinators and we are continually improving our system to ensure that slot requests and submissions are made in a timely way  and used in a way that delivers the maximum benefit for the Company.
Fleet development Our planned growth means we need planned aircraft deliveries.
Wizz Air has big plans  we will continue to grow and we will continue to be ready to respond to competitive challenges.
However in order to do so we need capacity and that means that we need an appropriate supply contract for new aircraft which manufacturers are able to deliver.
And the emphasis here is on new aircraft  we currently operate one of the youngest fleets in Europe with an average age of 4.4 years and that means we have a more efficient fleet which is more reliable and therefore able to be utilised for over twelve hours a day.
For the business that means lower unit operating costs and for our customers lower prices.
Our existing order book with Airbus as at 31 March 2017 comprised a further 23 Airbus A320ceofamily aircraft split into eight A320ceo and 15 A321ceo deliveries all of which will be delivered before the end of 2018.
From 2019 onwards we will start to take delivery of the A321neo aircraft ordered at the Paris Air Show in June 2015.
We have selected Pratt and Whitneys geared turbofan engine to power our A321neo deliveries.
However there have been a number of operational issues connected with the introduction of the geared turbofan engine.
This is always a risk with groundbreaking new technology but the advantage is that once solved the new technology offers a step change in efficiency and the prospect of development and optimisation in the years ahead.
While we remain confident in our selection of the geared turbofan engine we are in constant dialogue with Pratt and Whitney to ensure that we have sufficient capacity to deliver our planned growth.
A large aircraft order is a significant financial commitment and so requires financing.
To date we have financed all of our new aircraft deliveries through sale and leaseback arrangements.
This will continue to be the case for the remaining A320ceofamily deliveries through to the end of 2018 for which we already have in place fully committed sale and leaseback financing.
We are now starting to consider the best options for financing the first A321neo deliveries from 2019  we are confident that given the aircrafts desirability as a result of its superior operating economics and Wizz Airs established strong financial track record finance will be readily available on competitive terms.
Regulatory risks Ensuring compliance.
Even in a liberalised air traffic right environment aviation remains a highly regulated industry.
Wizz Air relies on an air operators certificate AOC and operating licence issued by Hungary in order to exercise the right to operate air services both within Europe and to and from countries with which Europe has liberalised air traffic agreements.
The AOC requires the Company to be majority owned and effectively controlled by qualifying nationals which currently means nationals of the European Economic Area and Switzerland.
If the Company ceases to be majority owned and effectively controlled by qualifying nationals then its AOC and operating licence  and so its right to operate its business  could be at risk.
The
Company therefore closely monitors the nationality of its Shareholders.
The Board has set a limit permitted maximum of 49% of its issued Ordinary Shares for ownership by nonqualifying nationals and the Board has the power to take action in relation to nonqualifying Shareholder shareholdings to protect the Companys AOC and operating licence.
During the course of the 2017 financial year the Board exercised some of these powers placing a temporary ban on the further acquisition of Ordinary Shares by nonqualifying Shareholders to stop the permitted maximum being exceeded.
The Board receives a report at each Board meeting of the level of share ownership by nonqualifying nationals.
Operational risks Safety events.
An accident or incident or terrorist attack can adversely affect an airlines image and customers willingness to travel with that airline.
At Wizz Air our number one priority is the safety of our aircraft passengers and crew.
Our aircraft fleet is young and reliable we use the services of worldclass maintenance organisations and we have a strong safety culture.
A crossfunctional safety council meets twice a year involving both senior management as well as operational staff and reviews any issues which have arisen in the past six months and the actions taken as a consequence.
In addition to this we collect detailed data from all aspects of our operation in order to identify Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2017 30 STRATEGIC REPORT PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES CONTINUED Risks relating to the Group continued Operational risks continued trends and relevant personnel from our Operations department meet twice a year to discuss any trends identified in their sphere of operation and how they are being dealt with.
We also operate an anonymous safety reporting system to allow our flight and cabin crew to report safety issues which are a concern to them.
Our
In July 2016 Wizz Air achieved registration under the International Air Transport Associations Operational Safety Audit IOSA.
The IOSA programme is the worldwide standard in airline safety evaluation and assesses an airlines safety management and control systems and processes.
Our experienced security team has an ongoing programme to check that the security of our operations and the airports which we serve meet high standards.
We know that the proper management of risk means that we must anticipate and deal with issues in advance.
Our security team also maintains close contact with relevant authorities in order to assess any potential security or other threats to our operations.
Any serious threat will be escalated to senior management.
We have in the past suspended operations to destinations where the safety of our aircraft passengers and crew cannot be guaranteed.
In December 2015 Wizz Air Hungary Ltd.
Company now enjoys enhanced security information and protection under the auspices of the Hungarian Constitution Protection Office.
Human resources Wizz Air is a people business.
We know that our people are the backbone of our business and it is their dedication day in day out that allows us to deliver our lowcost quality service.
But we know that we cannot take our people for granted and that competition for the high quality people who we seek is keen and may become even more so.
From time to time pilots and others can be in short supply.
We invest a huge amount of time in recruiting pilots and also training them to maintain our high standards.
In order to ensure the future availability of pilots of the right calibre we have recently announced a fiveyear training partnership with CTC Aviation Training and Central European Flight Academy to provide cadet pilots to Wizz Air.
We have also introduced an innovative scheme which allows pilots who are currently turboprop captains to transition quickly to a position with Wizz Air.
We are proud that to date we have maintained a good relationship with our employees and we have not experienced industrial unrest.
We strive to make sure that this will remain the case but we realise that there can be no guarantee.
We know that we need to ensure that we continue to motivate our colleagues.
Feedback is an essential part of this process  both giving and receiving  and we consider direct communication between senior management and other employees as the best way of listening to our employees concerns.
Visits by senior management to each of our operating bases are organised at least annually.
Following on from last years online and inperson employee feedback programme followup surveys relating to a number of matters that arose were conducted with our colleagues from Flight Operations and Cabin Operations and a number of improvement actions were implemented.
Our success to date has also depended on a number of key personnel including our Chief Executive Officer other senior managers and post holders required by regulation.
Our continuing success will depend on having the right people in those key positions.
While in the past we have successfully recruited for those positions we recognise that we have a pool of talent within the Company and have recently started a talent assessment and leadership development programme for our staff.
Succession of key personnel is a matter which we take extremely seriously and we shall continue to develop our succession planning processes to ensure that we have colleagues of the right calibre to lead the Company in the future.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT A COMPANY COMMITTED TO HIGH STANDARDS OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Chairmans statement on corporate governance Wizz Air is a company which continues to grow at a marketleading rate.
Wizz Airs Directors recognise the trust that investors have placed in the Companys business and continue to ensure high standards of corporate governance.
Continuing the Boards development to reflect the Companys standing as a FTSE 250 company I was delighted to welcome Wioletta Rosoowska as an additional NonExecutive Director shortly before the Companys annual general meeting with effect from 1 June 2016.
Wioletta brings to the Board extremely relevant extensive Central and Eastern European consumer and marketing experience gained during her ongoing successful executive career.
As I reported in last years annual report the Directors participated in a performance evaluation of the Board its Committees and individual Directors and a number of actions were implemented as a result.
For example Directors were given the opportunity to spend a number of days visiting the Companys office in Budapest as well as its base in Warsaw to speak with management and employees as well as experience a number of areas of the Companys business from crew training to ramp handling.
The Board also has a renewed focus on the Companys strategy essential as the business continues to grow rapidly with the existing aircraft orders projecting an airline of at least 150 aircraft by the end of 2024.
The Board will repeat the performance evaluation with reference to the financial year ended 31 March 2017 through an internally facilitated process to ensure that actions arising from the previous evaluation were implemented appropriately and to ensure that processes continue to develop to support the Companys growth in the future.
One key example of the continuous review and development of processes is the development of a more structured enterprise risk management system which has now been completed and the results presented to the
The Companys Audit Committee and management worked with Ernst and Young to implement this enterprise risk management system with the participation of a newly created Risk Council involving the Companys Chief Executive Officer all other officers and a number of heads of functions.
The enterprise risk management system has been embedded in the Companys culture through comprehensive training at all management levels and ongoing training will ensure that the principles continue to be applied in the Companys risk management processes and as the Company encounters and deals with new issues in the future.
Trading in the Companys shares over the financial year ended 31 March 2017 resulted in a number of changes in the Companys shareholders.
Following an increase in the shareholdings of a number of shareholders who were not Qualifying Nationals as defined in the Companys Articles of Association the Board took certain measures to ensure that the aggregate of those shareholdings did not exceed the Permitted Maximum also as defined in the Companys Articles of Association.
Those measures have now been removed although the Company continues to monitor closely such shareholdings on a regular basis.
This demonstrates that where required the Board is prepared to take decisive action to ensure the protection of the Companys interests and ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements.
The Board thanks each and every one of our investors for the faith they have shown in the Companys business and also recognises the trust that the Shareholders have placed in the Board and senior management.
Over
Any concerns or comments raised were fed back to the Board.
Once again I would stress that the trust that both investors and other stakeholders have placed in the Board is not taken for granted.
We will continue to develop our processes to ensure that our policy of ensuring high standards of governance appropriate for the Company is maintained in the future and in a manner which is appropriate for the Companys continued fast rate of growth.

The Board has considered the independence of the Companys NonExecutive Directors and has concluded that f William A.
Franke the Chairman does not meet the independence criteria set out in the Corporate Governance Code given that he is the managing partner of Indigo a significant Shareholder.

Accordingly as an absolute majority of the Directors are independent NonExecutive Directors the Company complies with the requirement of the Corporate Governance Code that at least half of the board excluding the chairman of a company with a premium listing should comprise independent nonexecutive directors.
Senior Independent NonExecutive Director The Corporate Governance Code recommends that the Board should appoint one of its independent NonExecutive Directors as the Senior Independent NonExecutive Director.
The Senior Independent NonExecutive Director should be available to Shareholders if they have concerns that contact through the normal channels of the Chairman or Chief Executive Officer has failed to resolve or where such contact is inappropriate.

MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY CONTINUED Board procedures At least six Board meetings are scheduled during each financial year.
At these meetings the Directors meet with Senior Executives to receive detailed updates on Wizz Airs business and operations and to discuss the Companys strategy.
Prior to these meetings each Director receives an information pack containing a comprehensive review of the Companys business as well as detailed proposals for approval of transactions and developments falling within the Boards remit.
The Company believes that this enables each Director properly to discharge his or her responsibilities.
At each Board meeting Directors who have a conflict of interest in any agenda item declare that interest and are not entitled to vote on that agenda item.
A number of key strategic and commercial decisions require Board approval and as and when any such decision is needed outside the scheduled meeting cycle an ad hoc telephone Board meeting may be arranged.
In general therefore it is anticipated that there will be around ten Board meetings in total during each financial year.
Newly appointed NonExecutive Directors meet with the Companys senior management and visit Wizz Airs operational headquarters to ensure that they have a thorough understanding of the Companys business.
Wizz Air maintains directors and officers liability insurance.
This insurance covers any claim that may be brought against the Directors in the exercise of their duties.
The Company has adopted a Share Dealing Policy that reflects and incorporates the provisions of the UK Listing Authoritys Model Code.
As a consequence the Directors as well as certain designated employees must obtain clearance from the Companys Chairman before dealing in the Companys shares and are prohibited from dealing at all during certain periods as set out in the Model Code.
The Share Dealing Policy was updated to reflect the requirements of the EU Market Abuse Regulation which came into effect on 3 July 2016.
Finally it is proposed that in accordance with the recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code all Directors will offer themselves for reelection at the 2017 annual general meeting.

REPORT OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE Wizz Air has grown significantly and successfully as a result in part of constantly reexamining the way it does things and ensuring that its business is run to the best possible standards.
The work of the Audit Committee during the 2017 financial year reflects this philosophy.
As well as the continued engagement on daytoday financial issues including further discussion on hedging strategy and approval of hedging transactions the Audit Committee has worked closely with the Companys Internal Audit function together with external advisers to run an effective programme of internal audits and to overhaul completely the Companys system for enterprise risk management ERM to ensure that the Companys risk management processes continue to provide a strong foundation for its future growth.
Main activities of the Audit Committee during the 2017 financial year
Risk management
The Audit Committee is tasked with ensuring that the Board has adequate oversight of risk management and that it deems the controls sufficient and effective.
The Companys Internal Audit function conducts an annual risk assessment exercise involving senior management from the level of heads of function upwards.
Following implementation of the new ERM framework the assessment of each risk involves consideration of the inherent risk existing mitigating measures and residual risk along with a determination of how that risk should be dealt with in accordance with the Companys risk appetite.
The resulting risk register is then used to prepare a principal risk report.
A new internal Risk Council comprising the Companys senior management team as well as a number of other senior members of management reviews the risk register and the principal risk report at least once a quarter.
The Risk Council then reports to the Audit Committee on among other things changes to be made to the principal risk report.
The principal risk report once approved by the Audit Committee is delivered to the Board.
The risk register is also used to develop an Internal Audit plan for the upcoming year which is approved by the Audit
Internal audits are performed by Ernst and Young and the Head of Internal Audit who has direct responsibility to the Chairman of the Audit Committee as well as a reporting line to the Companys Chief Executive Officer.
Following completion of an Internal Audit a report is compiled which sets out the findings makes recommendations for control improvement and presents the improvement actions undertaken by management.
Internal audit reports are submitted and presented to the Audit Committee for approval.
The
Chairman gives a report of the Internal Audit reports completed in a particular period to the full Board.
Internal Audit then verifies that actions have been taken and controls implemented and reports back to the Audit Committee on the status.
The Audit Committee will work to ensure that the Company continues to develop effective risk assessment and management processes.
More information on risk management within the Company is set out on pages 26 to 30 of this annual report.
Financial information The Audit Committee reviews and approves all interim and final financial statements as well as the content of the Companys annual report.
The Companys external auditors provide the Audit Committee with a briefing on any issues arising.
The Audit Committee also reviews and approves any regulatory announcements that are made in connection with such financial information.
It is only after the Audit Committees approval that the statements are put to the Board for approval.
Relationship with external auditors The Audit Committee has approved the fees to be paid and the external audit plan for the 2017 financial year and reviewed the reports of the auditors on the halfyear review and the annual audit performed.
Taking into account the above and the result of the AQR review see later the Audit Committee was satisfied with the performance of the external auditors and with the effectiveness of the external audit process.
The audit of the 2017 financial statements and of this annual report and the review of the halfyear financial report were all completed in time and in good quality addressing the key issues.
The Audit Committee will consider the appointment of external auditors for the financial year ending 31 March 2018 and the Directors will propose a resolution in this respect for the forthcoming annual general meeting of the Company.
Should the Directors later decide to appoint a firm other than the current auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers the Directors would ask the shareholders to ratify the appointment of the new auditor at the 2018 annual general meeting.
The Audit Committee ensures the independence of the Companys external auditors.
The Audit Committee reviewed the independence letter of the auditors and considered in particular the nonaudit fees paid to the external auditors during the year see Note 6 to the financial statements.
While fees paid on tax and other advisory services were higher in 2017 than the audit fees the Audit Committee was satisfied that this did not compromise the objectivity and independence of the auditors mainly because i the engagement leaders from the relevant Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2017 45
REPORT OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
Main activities of the Audit Committee during the 2017 financial year continued Relationship with external auditors continued advisory departments are not part of the audit team and ii no such services were ordered by the Company that carried selfreview threat for the auditor.
Significant matters relating to the annual report In the course of the preparation of the Companys financial statements the following issues were considered by the Audit Committee Maintenance accounting As part of reviewing the reports from management and the auditor on the half year and the yearend accounts the Audit Committee satisfied itself that the policy and the procedures applicable to this complex area were followed in the year consistently including the regular updates to estimates and judgments and the maintenance of the system supporting the calculations.
Membership revenues Until 2016 the Group recognised membership revenues arising from the Wizz Discount Club WDC customer loyalty program on a straightline basis over the twelvemonth period of the membership.
During the year management presented its analysis showing that the actual pattern of customers taking benefit of the program is different from being straight line and proposed that going forward membership revenues would be better recognised based on the actual historic usage pattern.
The Audit Committee approved this change in estimate for the purposes of accounting for membership revenues on the condition that management should review the applicability of the pattern at least once every year see Note 4 for more information.
Segment reporting The Audit Committee satisfied itself that starting from the 2017 financial year it was appropriate to introduce separate presentation for the results of the airline and the online tour operator business units of the Group.
This applies both for segment reporting disclosures under IFRS 8 and for the business analysis of revenues operating expenses and certain KPIs in the Strategic Report.
At the request of the Board the Audit Committee also considered whether the annual report taken as a whole was fair balanced and understandable and whether it provided the necessary information for Shareholders to assess the Groups position and performance business model and strategy.
The Committee is satisfied that the annual report meets these criteria.
Other matters considered during the year FRC AQR review During the year the Audit Quality Review AQR team of the UK Financial Reporting Council FRC reviewed the audit of the 2016 financial statements of the Group that had been performed by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP UK.
The AQR team monitors the quality of the audit work of statutory auditors and audit firms in the UK that audit Public Interest Entities PIEs and certain other entities.
The overall assessment of the audit found that there were no significant areas of concern.
The report from the AQR was received and reviewed by the Audit Committee and the Committee was satisfied with the good result of the review.
The recommendations from the review have been incorporated into the audit of the 2017 financial statements.
New accounting standards There were important developments during the year in relation to three new IFRSs that will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
In order of importance IFRS 16 Leases The standard is awaiting endorsement by the EU that is currently expected by the end of 2017.
The Committee has not taken a position whether to adopt the standard early from 1 April 2018 or from the date required by the standard 1 April 2019.
The Committee has reviewed managements preliminary analysis of the potential impacts of the standard on the financial statements of the Group and approved the related disclosure  see Note 2 Accounting policies to the financial statements.
IFRS 9 Financial instruments The Committee supported managements proposal to early adopt IFRS 9 starting from 1 April 2017.
IFRS 9 enables the Group to eliminate the impact on earnings resulting from changes in the time value of hedges.
The change in the time value of hedges was the last transaction of recurring nature that the Group classified as exceptional item in its financial statements.
Therefore the adoption of IFRS 9 means that commencing from the 2018 financial year it is expected that the Group will not have any exceptional items and therefore it can discontinue the presentation of underlying earnings which differ from IFRS earnings.
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers The Committee reviewed managements preliminary assessment for the implications of this standard and supported managements recommendation to adopt it from the standard date that is 1 April 2018.

REPORT OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
Main activities of the Audit Committee during the 2017 financial year continued Other matters considered during the year continued Hedging Policy update In January 2017 management proposed and the Committee approved the following changes to the Groups Hedging Policy The maximum hedge coverage levels allowed by the Policy were increased by 10 per cent. fuel and on FX hedges.
This means moving from 60 to 70 per cent. and moving from 50 to 60 per cent. on a rolling 18month basis.
For the closest quarter the maximum level allowed by the Policy was increased from 75 to 85 per cent Implement new hedging instruments for short dated exposures particularly fuel and FX swaps with a tenure of 13 months.
Introduce FX hedging for the GBPEUR currency pair with a view to the significant GBP long position of the Group and the increased volatility of GBP FX rates following the Brexit vote.
Tendering statutory audit services for the Group The EU Competition and Market Authoritys CMA Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities Order 2014 the CMA Order defines requirements for mandatory tendering of statutory audit services and the responsibility of audit committees in this respect.
It applies to EUincorporated companies in FTSE 350 companies for financial years beginning on or after January 1 2015.
The CMA Order technically does not apply to the Group given that its holding entity is incorporated outside the EU.
At the same time while the complyorexplain provision in the UK Corporate Governance Code on audit tendering continues to apply to the Company for the current year it has been withdrawn in the version of the Corporate Governance Code which applies to the 2018 financial year.
Nevertheless the Audit Committee confirms that the Group is willing to voluntarily comply with the Order.
The Audit Committee also confirms that the Group complied with the provisions of the CMA Order in its 2017 financial year.
PricewaterhouseCoopers have been the auditors since 2007 and audit services were last tendered in 2011.
Management proposed and the Committee approved the plan that during the 2018 financial year the statutory audit services for the Group will be tendered.
The tendering process will also ensure that audit and nonaudit services will be properly separated.
The Committee trusts that these measures will overall support the independence objectivity and value for money of the audit process.
Tax matters The Committee reviewed managements analysis i of the significant developments in the international tax environment in the last 12 years including the OECD BEPS measures and ii of the Swiss Corporate Tax Reform III. public referendum in Switzerland.
The Committee is satisfied that currently there are no explicit impacts of these changes on the tax position of the Group and therefore that immediate changes are not required.
However together with management the Committee will continue to monitor developments closely.

The Companys success to date has been achieved by ensuring that it appoints people of the highest calibre whether as Directors management or employees.

DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT
Report of the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Wizz Airs second full financial year as a listed company was more challenging than the first.
While demand remained strong the lower fuel price and increased competition fed through to lower fares and in June 2016 the United Kingdom voted in a referendum to withdraw from its membership of the European Union causing a significant fall in the value of the British Pound which accounts for approximately 20 per cent.
Companys revenues.
The operating environment was equally challenging with the Company having to deal with unusually severe winter weather in Eastern Europe and a massive increase in disruption caused by industrial action by various air traffic control and airport organisations throughout the year.
Nonetheless during the 2017 financial year the Company delivered industryleading passenger growth of 18.9 per cent. increase of total revenue of 9.9 per cent. translating to underlying net profits of 225.3 million.
At the same time the Company remained extremely costfocused with its operating unit cost falling by 7.8 per cent.
The relative strength of Wizz Airs performance against its peers was reflected in a share price which as at 31 March 2017 remained some 43 per cent. higher than the offering price in the Companys initial public offering.
Over
The Remuneration Committee remains committed to ensuring that the Companys Remuneration Policy remains an effective way to align the interests of the Directors and senior management with those of the Companys Shareholders and that it provides appropriate incentivisation to continue to deliver Shareholder value.
However the Remuneration Committee also remains focused on the Companys ultralowcost business model and the governing principle that will continue to be applied is that remuneration must be competitive whilst not being more than is necessary to attract retain and motivate executive management of the quality required to continue to run the Company successfully and that a significant proportion of remuneration remains performance based.
Indeed this is a principle which is applied consistently throughout the Company for almost all employees.
As a company we value our Shareholders feedback including on remuneration matters.
I was pleased that last years Annual Report on Remuneration received a vote in favour from our Shareholders of 99.3 per cent.
As contemplated in the approved Directors Remuneration Policy successful Company performance is reflected in the remuneration of the Executive Director and senior management.
Under our Shortterm Incentive Plan performance against the four measures of underlying profit after tax exfuel cost per available seat kilometre CASK ontime performance and individual performance assessment resulted in an average payout equivalent to 84.9 per cent. of the target payout.
The first award under the approved Longterm Incentive Plan was made during the 2016 financial year in July 2015 to officers and to heads of function.
This award is due to vest in July 2018 with level of vesting for the major part of the award based on a combination of relative total shareholder return TSR performance compared to selected European airlines and fully diluted earnings per share growth.
The second award was made during the 2017 financial year in June 2016 with similar performance conditions to that of the 2016 award.
This award is due to vest in June 2019.
Further details of the performance conditions attached to these awards are provided on page 55.
Following a review of the Companys Remuneration Policy during the year the Remuneration Committee agreed that it remains appropriate and is aligned with the overall strategy of the Company and therefore no changes will be made in the year ahead.
We last increased the base salary for the CEO in the 2016 financial year following a comprehensive market review.
The Committee has determined that the CEOs base salary remains competitive and therefore no changes were proposed for the 2017 financial year and are not proposed for the 2018 financial year.
Whilst the Company is incorporated in Jersey we have chosen voluntarily to comply in all material respects with the provisions of the UK Companies Act 2006 and related regulations in respect of the Directors Remuneration Report and Remuneration Policy underlining the Companys commitment to adopt UK corporate governance best practice.
The Directors Remuneration Policy was approved by Shareholders at the Companys annual general meeting in September 2015 with the intention that it should apply for three years.
Therefore we will not be asking Shareholders to vote on the policy at this years annual general meeting although there will be an advisory vote on the Annual Report on Remuneration.
In line with the reporting requirements our Remuneration Policy will be put forward to a binding Shareholder vote at the 2018 AGM following a comprehensive review and consultation with Shareholders.

DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
Report of the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee continued In conclusion I would reiterate that Wizz Air continues to be proud of the strong results delivered in the 2017 financial year against a challenging industry background.
We remain committed to ensuring that our Remuneration Policy continues to incentivise delivery of outstanding results in the future but in a way that appropriately aligns the interests of the Directors and senior management with those of the Companys
We believe that the approved Directors Remuneration Policy does this in a way which is consistent with the Companys current growth phase and its desire to bring simplicity to all areas of its operation.
Simplicity of process and practice reflects the Companys strategy to focus on achieving the lowest possible unit operating cost while improving customers experience.
We look forward to the continued support of our Shareholders and welcome any questions or suggestions that you may have to further align our Remuneration Policy with the interests of our investors.

Remuneration Policy
Our principal consideration when determining the Remuneration Policy is to ensure that it supports our company strategy and business objectives as well as to attract retain and motivate executive management of the quality required to run the Company successfully without paying more than is necessary.
In the selection of performance measures for both the annual performance bonus and the Longterm Incentive Plan the Remuneration Committee takes into account the Groups strategic objectives and short and longterm business priorities.
The performance targets are set in accordance with the Groups annual operating plan and are reviewed annually to ensure that they are sufficiently stretching.
In selecting the targets the Remuneration Committee also takes into account analysts forecasts economic conditions and the Remuneration Committees expectation of performance over the relevant period.
The aim of the Remuneration Policy is to attract retain and motivate executive management without paying more than is necessary incentivise the successful execution of the Companys business strategy and align the Executive Directors longterm interests with those of Shareholders.
Executive Director remuneration The Chief Executive Officer is currently the Companys sole Executive Director.
The Remuneration Committee believes that the Companys Remuneration Policy supports the Companys ultralowcost business model by incentivising senior management including the Chief Executive Officer to continue to strive to increase the Companys cost advantage while improving the customers experience.
The Chief Executive Officer currently

This impact was stronger for other employees than for the Chief Executive Officer because i two Officer positions were unfilled at the end of the year hence no bonus was payable for these and ii not only the aggregate amount of the bonus got lower but also the total number of employees increased during the year most of whom are not entitled for bonus.
Total employee remuneration changed from 68.6 million in the 2016 financial year to 77.9 million in the 2017 financial year see Note 7 to the financial statements being a 13.5 per cent. increase yearonyear.
This was driven also by the 21.1 per cent. increase in employee numbers excluding rented pilots.
There were no dividends or share buybacks either in the 2017 financial year or the 2016 financial year and therefore disclosure of relative importance of spend on pay has not been included.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY OUR APPROACH Wizz Air is the largest lowcost airline in Central and Eastern Europe.
That means that we play a large part in the lives of many people  whether our customers or our colleagues  as well as being important to the communities which we serve.
We appreciate and value that position but that means that we appreciate that we must ensure that our business approach not only provides the opportunity to travel to more and more people but also takes account of economic environmental and social developments affecting our communities and our people.
Responsibility for the environment Wizz Air believes that our industry has to be responsible for the environments in which we operate.
We also believe that there are many things that we can do that are not only good for business but also good for the environment.
Thats why we are always looking at opportunities to use the latest innovative technologies that not only deliver operational efficiencies but also reduce our environmental footprint.
Operating the most modern most efficient aircraft One of the cornerstones of Wizz Air business model has always been the operation of the latest technology most efficient aircraft.
We currently as at 31st March 2017 operate a fleet of 79 Airbus A320 and Airbus A321ceo aircraft with an average age of just 4.4 years  one of the youngest in Europe.
The Airbus A321ceo a type of which we currently operate 16 with a further 15 to be delivered before the end of 2018 is already todays most efficient singleaisle aircraft.
All of our newdelivery aircraft are equipped with sharklets which deliver an average 3.9% inflight fuel saving compared to standard wingfence aircraft.
However in 2019 we will receive the first of the 110 Airbus A321neo aircraft which we have on order equipped with next generation Pratt and Whitney PW1100G geared turbofan engines.
The technology in these engines is new and disruptive to the market and according to manufacturers estimates should deliver the lowest specific fuel consumption in its category and a reduction of 15 percent in fuel burn compared to todays single aisle aircraft as well as lower CO2 emissions and lower noise levels.
Fuel saving initiatives Wizz Air currently has over 60 fuel saving initiatives which are either in the research and development phase or are already embedded in our operations such as cost index optimisation or the use of thrust reversers.
Whats good for business is good for the environment  less fuel consumed means fewer emissions.
Contributing to the economy Wizz brings the opportunity to travel at the lowest fares to its millions of passengers.
Giving affordable access to our customers to explore the wider world or to travel quickly and cheaply to see friends and relatives or to develop their careers abroad improves lives.
But more than this Wizz Air is often the first airline at an airport to offer international flights connecting cities throughout Europe.
And that in turn means more visitors boosting both local tourism as well as business links.
As a result Wizz Air does not only provide job opportunities to each of the more than 3000 aviation professionals already working in the Wizz team but through our continuously developing network and operations we support numerous workplaces at our 141 destinations.
Indeed based on the research of ACI Europe every 1 million carried passengers per year supports 750 local jobs meaning that the 24 million passengers we carried in the 2017 financial year Wizz supported over 18000 jobs.
Responsibility for our colleagues and our community It may sound a clich but we know that at Wizz Air its true our people are the most important element of Wizz Airs success.
We support our colleagues with new outstanding career opportunities in this exciting industry.
We are immensely proud of the diverse Wizz team and ensure that we engage with and take feedback from our colleagues to increase our already high employee satisfaction rate.
For our customers we are continuously developing our services to enhance the WIZZ customer experience.

Since our very first flight in 2004 Wizz Air has been democratising air travel.
Our motto back in 2004 was that Now We Can All Fly  and we believe that just as with air travel an active lifestyle should also be available for everyone.

In April 2017 we announced that we would be sponsoring the Sofia Marathon.
The number of participants in the events has been continuously increasing with more and more runners coming from all over the world including an ever increasing number of Wizz colleagues.
Wizz supports communities Wizz knows that the opportunity for more and more people to afford to fly is changing the world for the better.
But we also know that we can do more to support the communities that we serve Thats why we support charity activities initiated by our cabin crew to support their local communities.
These activities range from helping struggling families in Poland supporting childrens medical services in Hungary creating better educational conditions in Romania and Latvia or giving presents to orphans in Macedonia.
The care and attention of our cabin crews is making life better  not just above the clouds Diversity and equal opportunities Wizz Air is an equal opportunity employer.

We know that our people are the backbone of our business and it is their dedication day in day out that allows us to deliver our lowcost quality service.
But we know that we cannot take our people for granted and that competition for the high quality people whom we seek is keen and may become even more so.

The survey confirmed that our colleagues are highly engaged and consider Wizz as an employer of choice.
The general satisfaction of the Wizz team is 85 percent which is 25 percent higher than the average engagement rate measured in Europe and 20 percent higher compared to the global results.
Recruitment and career As a fastgrowing company Wizz Air is continuously recruiting to find new colleagues passionate about the aviation industry whether they are talents early in their career or experienced professionals with significant expertise and successful track records.
The Company recruits an average of 500 new employees each year.
We also pride ourselves on the possibility for internal career development for colleagues and the number of promotions within the Company last year once again demonstrated that commitment dedication and hard work are recognised in the best ways possible  career and personal development.

DIRECTORS REPORT The Directors present their report and the audited consolidated financial statements for Wizz Air Holdings plc the Company and its subsidiaries the Group for the year ended 31 March 2017.
Results and dividend The results for the year are shown on page 76.
The Directors do not recommend the payment of a dividend 2016 nil.
Directors
The Directors of the Company who were in office during the year and up to the date of signing the financial statements are listed below Jzsef Vradi William A.
Franke
John R.
Wilson
Stephen L.
Johnson
John McMahon Thierry de Preux Simon Duffy Guido Demuynck Susan Hooper Wioletta Rosolowska appointed with effect from 1 June 2016 Going concern Wizz Airs business activities financial performance and financial position together with factors likely to affect its future development and performance are described in the Strategic Report on pages 4 to 25.
Principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group are described on pages 27 to 30.
Note 3 to the accounts sets out the Groups objectives policies and procedures for managing its capital and provides details of the risks related to financial instruments held by the Group.
At 31 March 2017 the Group held cash and cash equivalents of 774.0 million while net current assets were 434.5 million.
Other than convertible debt with a balance of 27.1 million the Group has no significant external borrowings.
The Directors have reviewed financial forecasts including plans to finance future aircraft deliveries.
After making enquiries the Directors have satisfied themselves that the Group is expected to be able to meet its commitments and obligations for at least the next twelve months from the date of signing this report.
Accordingly they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these financial statements.
Viability
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the UK Corporate Governance Code  the Directors have assessed the prospects and the viability of the Group over a threeyear period to March 2020.
The Directors have determined that the threeyear period was the appropriate period because i Wizz Air has a fast expanding business which gives less certainty of certain key forecasting assumptions over a longer period and ii the Groups strategic planning process traditionally covers three years.
Assessment of prospects The Groups prospects are assessed by management and the Board primarily through the strategic planning process.
This threeyear plan takes into account the current position of the Group includes the fully detailed annual operating plan for the financial year starting in this case for the year ending March 2018 and then building on it a sufficiently detailed bottomup forecast for further two financial years.
The Board participates fully in the process by aligning the key assumptions and the topline financial targets reviewing and approving the annual operating plan and reviewing and acknowledging the threeyear plan.
The plan takes into account the existing aircraft order book of the Group that defines a programmed growth for several years ahead.
Financing of future aircraft deliveries is already secured with lease contracts until the end of 2018.
The Directors believe that the growth assumptions are justified also from the demand side as the Group continues to execute its core strategy that is to have lower cost than any of its competitors and with low prices stimulate further demand for its services both in existing and new markets.
Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2017 64
DIRECTORS REPORT CONTINUED Viability continued Assessment of viability Although the strategic plan reflects management and the Directors best estimate of the future prospects of the business they have also tested the resilience of the business to unfavorable deviations of certain key variables from the base case scenario.
In defining these scenarios the Directors took into account the principal risks that could prevent the Group from delivering on its strategy and financial targets as summarised on pages 27 to 30 in the Strategic Report.
As part of this assessment the Directors made the following key assumptions  caveats there will not be a prolonged grounding of a substantial portion of the aircraft fleet and with regards to the expected departure of the UK from the European Union the terms of exit will be such that will allow the Group to continue to operate broadly the same network tofrom the UK as at present.
The Directors assessed the potential financial impacts of severe but plausible scenarios that the Group could experience.
The scenarios included significant increase in jet fuel prices significant strengthening of the US Dollar and weakening of the British Pound to the Euro decreasing unit revenues increasing crew costs potential delays in the supply of the new A320neo aircraft family from Airbus and a combination of these factors.
While several risks can impact revenues increased competition in key markets was considered the most important risk both in terms of likelihood and potential impact.
The results of the testing showed that due to the strong competitive position operating cash flows and existing reserves of the Group it would be able to withstand the impact of these scenarios over the period of the financial forecasts.
Viability statement Based on this assessment the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period to March 2020.
Disclosure of information to auditors The Directors at the date of approval of the financial statements confirmed that so far as they are aware there is no relevant audit information of which the Companys auditors are unaware and they have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as Directors in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Companys auditors are aware of that information.
Independent auditors A resolution for the appointment of the auditors of the Company for the financial year ending 31 March 2018 is to be proposed by the Directors at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Indemnities

This insurance covers any claim that may be brought against the Directors in the exercise of their duties.

What we have audited The financial statements included within the Annual Report and Accounts the Annual Report comprise the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as at 31 March 2017 the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year then ended the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended and the notes to the financial statements which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report rather than in the notes to the financial statements.
These are crossreferenced from the financial statements and are identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and applicable law.
Our audit approach
Materiality
Overall group materiality 12.7 million which represents 5% of profit before income tax.
Audit scope The group financial statements are a consolidation of Wizz Air Holdings plc the trading subsidiaries Wizz Air Hungary Kft Wizz Tours and a number of insignificant intermediate holding small trading dormant and ceased operation companies.
The accounting for these entities and the group consolidation is largely centralised in Hungary where the majority of our audit work was performed.
Our audit scope comprised an audit of Wizz Air Holdings plc and the complete financial information of Wizz Air Hungary Kft being the significant component.
Areas of focus Aircraft maintenance provisioning.
Hedge and derivative accounting.
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing UK and Ireland ISAs UK and Ireland.
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements.
In particular we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.
As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit including the allocation of our resources and effort are identified as areas of focus in the table below.
We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole and any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be read in this context.
This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF WIZZ AIR HOLDINGS PLC CONTINUED Report on the group financial statements continued Our audit approach continued The scope of our audit and our areas of focus continued Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus Aircraft maintenance provisioning The group operates aircraft which are held under operating lease arrangements and incurs liabilities for maintenance during the term of the lease.
Provisions arise from legal and contractual obligations relating to the condition of the aircraft when it is returned to the lessor.
The risk is that with the inherent level of management judgement required in calculating the amount of provision together with the complexity of the calculation of a number of variable factors and assumptions the provision may be understated.
Maintenance provisions of 111.8 million for aircraft maintenance costs in respect of operating leased aircraft are recorded in the financial statements at 31 March 2017 refer to note 29 to the financial statements.
For aircraft held under operating lease agreements the group is contractually committed to either return the aircraft in a certain condition or to compensate the lessor based on the actual condition of the aircraft and its major components upon return.
Provision is made for the minimum unavoidable costs of specific future obligations created by the lease at the time when such obligation becomes certain.
This is when the respective aircraft component no longer meets the lease redelivery conditions.
Commonly there is a warranty period for components at the start during which no obligation arises provisioning only commences after this warranty period.
At each balance sheet date the calculation of the maintenance provision derived from the maintenance provision system MPS includes a number of variable factors and assumptions including likely utilisation of the aircraft the expected cost of the heavy maintenance check and the time it is expected to occur the condition of the aircraft and the lifespan of lifelimited parts.
The provision booked by Management was considered appropriate in the Directors view.
We evaluated the integrity of the maintenance provision system MPS and tested the calculations therein.
This included assessing the process by which the variable factors within the provision were estimated evaluating the reasonableness of the assumptions testing the input data and re performing calculations.
We found no significant issues in the MPS input data or the calculated maintenance assets and provisions.
The basis for these calculations was found to be consistent with prior periods and in line with the detailed accounting policy set out in Note 2.
We compared the cost assumptions in the MPS to recent invoices inspected future flight schedules and approved maintenance plans as well as validated current flight hours and flight cycles to nonfinancial data sources.
We found no material exceptions from these procedures and estimates.
We read new or amended aircraft lease contracts and validated the updated MPS input data.
We found no material exceptions from these procedures.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF WIZZ AIR HOLDINGS PLC CONTINUED Report on the group financial statements continued Our audit approach continued The scope of our audit and our areas of focus continued Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus Hedge and derivative accounting The group uses derivative financial instruments options to hedge transaction currency comprising fuel leasing and maintenance US dollar payments and jet fuel price risks.
The risk is that because of their materiality to the financial position of the Group and the level of manual input in monitoring open closed and settled derivatives and the complexity of the requirements in order to apply hedge accounting e. statements.
At 31 March 2017 derivative financial assets amounted to 10.1 million and derivative financial liabilities were 1.8 million.
Further details are set out in notes 2 3 and 20 to the financial statements.
The Directors review concluded that the amounts booked at 31 March 2017 are not materially misstated.
We evaluated the processes procedures and controls in respect of the groups treasury and other management functions which directly impact the relevant account balances and transactions.
We tested managements yearend account reconciliation process including cutoff procedures.
The results of this work allowed us to focus on substantiating the yearend positions recorded in the financial statements.
We independently obtained direct confirmations from each of the counterparties to test the cutoff at the year end.
We found no material exceptions from these confirmations.
We assessed the appropriateness of hedge accounting for the derivative financial instruments and adequate hedge documentation and effectiveness testing was found to be in place.
We tested using independent datafeeds the fair values being ascribed to those instruments at the year end and noted no significant exceptions.
We also assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures in the financial statements in respect of derivative financial instruments.
We did not identify any significant issues with the measurement or presentation of the groups derivative financial instruments.
How we tailored the audit scope We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole taking into account the geographic structure of the group the accounting processes and controls and the industry in which the group operates.
The Group has two reporting segments which comprise the airline and tour operator businesses.
The airline segment consists of Wizz Air Holdings plc and its trading subsidiary Wizz Air Hungary Kft which includes branch operations in base countries.
The Tour reporting segment consists of the Wizz Tours operations which sells travel packages to external customers.
The airline segment contributes over 98% of profit before income tax.
Therefore our audit scope comprised an audit of Wizz Air Holdings plc and the complete financial information of Wizz Air Hungary Kft being the only significant components.
The accounting for these entities and the group consolidation is centralised in Hungary.
The audit is performed by a single engagement team comprising individuals based in the UK and in Hungary.
The operations are audited by applying their collective knowledge and understanding of the Group and its financial reporting processes and controls.
In addition to the standard audit work performed by the engagement team based in Hungary the UK team members visited the Budapests management team three times during the audit cycle.
These visits involved discussing the audit approach areas of focus and issues arising from our work.
The UK team members also attended the local clearance meeting in Hungary and all Audit Committee meetings in Switzerland either in person or via telephone call.
This gave us the evidence we required for our opinion on the group financial statements as a whole.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF WIZZ AIR HOLDINGS PLC CONTINUED Report on the group financial statements continued Our audit approach continued
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality.
We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality.
These together with qualitative considerations helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements both individually and on the financial statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows Overall group materiality 12.7 million 2016 10.1 million.
How we determined it 5% of profit before income tax.
Rationale for benchmark applied We believe that profit before income tax is the primary measure used by shareholders in assessing the performance of the Group.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above 0.6 million 2016 0.4 million as well as misstatements below that amount that in our view warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern The Directors have complied with provision C.1.3 of the UK Corporate Governance Code the Code and provided a statement in relation to going concern set out in the Directors report.
The Directors have requested that we review the statement on going concern as if the Company were a UK registered company.
We have nothing to report having performed our review.
Under ISAs UK and Ireland we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to the directors statement about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to.
As noted in the Directors statement the directors have concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
The going concern basis presumes that the group has adequate resources to remain in operation and that the directors intend it to do so for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed.
As part of our audit we have concluded that the directors use of the going concern basis is appropriate.
However because not all future events or conditions can be predicted these statements are not a guarantee as to the groups ability to continue as a going concern.
Other required and voluntary reporting Consistency of other information Opinion on Strategic report and Directors report The Directors voluntarily prepare a Strategic report and Directors report in accordance with the provisions of the United Kingdom Companies Act 2006.
The Directors have requested that we express an opinion on the consistency of that information with the financial statements in accordance with the United Kingdom Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.

Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2017 81 ACCOUNTS AND OTHER INFORMATION NOTES FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS General information Wizz Air Holdings plc the Company is a public company incorporated in Jersey under the address 44 The Esplanade St Helier Jersey JE4 9WG.
The Company is managed from Switzerland.
The Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group or Wizz Air provide lowcost lowfare passenger air transportation services on scheduled shorthaul and mediumhaul pointtopoint routes across Europe and the Middle East.
Accounting policies The principal accounting policies applied in the presentation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
Basis of preparation These consolidated financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRSs and IFRS IC interpretations.
Based on the exemption provided in Article 105 11 of the Companies Jersey Law 1991 the Company does not present its individual financial statements and related notes.
The financial statements are presented in Euros which is the functional currency of all companies in the Group other than two dormant entities.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of availableforsale financial assets and financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value through profit or loss.
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS legislates the use of certain critical accounting estimates and requires management to exercise judgments in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies.
The areas involving a high degree of judgment or complexity or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 4.
New standards and interpretations a Standards amendments and interpretations effective and adopted by the Group The following new IFRSs and amendments are mandatory for financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016 and have therefore been adopted by the Group as of 1 April 2016.
Amendment to IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements  accounting for acquisitions of interests in joint operations.
Amendment to IAS 16 and IAS 38 Property Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets  clarifications of acceptable methods of depreciation and amortisation.
Annual improvements to IFRS 20122014 cycle  requires disclosure of the judgments made by management in aggregating operating segments and clarifies that a reconciliation of segment assets must only be disclosed if segment assets are reported.
Amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements  disclosure initiative.
Amendment to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows  disclosure initiative.
Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2017 82 ACCOUNTS AND OTHER INFORMATION NOTES FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Accounting policies continued New standards and interpretations continued b Standards early adopted by the Group There are no standards early adopted by the Group.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments  addresses the classification measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities.
The complete version of IFRS 9 was issued in July 2014.
It replaces the guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification and measurement of financial instruments.
IFRS 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement categories for financial assets amortised cost fair value through other comprehensive income or expense and fair value through profit or loss.
IFRS 9 allows changes in the time value of options to be recognised in other comprehensive income as opposed to the statement of comprehensive income under IAS 39.
For financial liabilities there were no changes to classification and measurement except for the recognition of changes in own credit risk in other comprehensive income for liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss.
IFRS 9 relaxes the requirements for hedge effectiveness by replacing the bright line hedge effectiveness tests.
It requires an economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument and for the hedged ratio to be the same as the one management actually uses for risk management purposes.
Contemporaneous documentation is still required but is different to that currently prepared under IAS 39.
The standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 with early adoption permitted.
The Group is adopting IFRS 9 from 1 April 2017.
The key impact of the adoption will be that changes in the time value of hedges will be recognised in other comprehensive income as opposed to the statement of comprehensive income.
Changes in the time value of hedges were material in last two financial years and given the volume of hedging activity of the Group are expected to be material also in the future.
However the size and the direction of these changes will depend on changes in market prices therefore it is not possible to make an estimate for the expected impact.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers  deals with revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful information to users of financial statements about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entitys contracts with customers.
Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good or service.
The standard replaces IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 Construction Contracts and related interpretations.
The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 and earlier application is permitted.
The Group will adopt IFRS 15 from 1 April 2018.
Based on the preliminary assessment of management under IFRS 15 some ancillary revenue types will need to be recognised on the date of flight rather than the date of sale as currently which will result in a oneoff reduction of revenues in the range of 67 million in the year of adoption.
IFRS 16 Leases effective for the accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019  addresses the classification measurement and recognition of leases with the objective of ensuring that lessees and lessors provide relevant information that faithfully represents those transactions.
The standard supersedes IAS 17 Leases and is subject to EU endorsement.
The Group currently leases all of its aircraft under operating leases therefore IFRS 16 brings a very significant change for the Group.
The standard is not yet endorsed by the EU and therefore only a preliminary modelling assessment has been performed by management.
Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2017 83 ACCOUNTS AND OTHER INFORMATION NOTES FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Accounting policies continued New standards and interpretations continued c Interpretations and standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group continued The following key issues were considered for the modelling Year of adoption Whether early adoption from 1 April 2018 will be an option available for the Group will depend on the timing of the EU endorsement.
In the current modelling early adoption was not assumed.
The assumed date of application is 1 April 2019.
That is the date required by the standard.
Existing leases The Group expects that all of its operating leases that will exist at the date of initial application would need to be reclassified under the new rules.
Considering all variations the standard allows three methods for implementing the new rules for existing leases a full retrospective approach as per paragraph C5a of the standard and modified retrospective approaches as per paragraph C5b of the standard with further variations permitted for the determination of the initial amount of the rightofuse asset as per paragraphs C8bi and C8bii respectively.
These three methods were each modelled assuming a consistent application to all leases existing at the date of initial application 1 April 2019.
Future aircraft New aircraft scheduled to arrive from the beginning of 2019 are not yet financed.
For the purposes of this modelling it was assumed that aircraft deliveries in 2019 and beyond will also be financed in the form of operating leases and under terms similar to those that the Group most recently entered into.
Foreign exchange Calculations were performed assuming an EURUSD FX rate of 1.08 for the date of initial application and not assuming any change to this rate during the year of initial application ending 31 March 2020.
Incremental rate of borrowing The current incremental rate of borrowing of the Group for aircraft financing is estimated to be 4 per cent and this rate was assumed also in these calculations in the second and third scenarios for the date of initial application.
The impact in the year of initial application can be summarised as follows rightofuse assets would be recognised in the amount of 1.21.4 billion at the date of initial application depending on the transition method used.
By the end of the year of initial application 31 March 2020 the balance would increase to 1.41.6 billion lease liabilities would be recognised in the amount of 1.41.5 billion at the date of initial application depending on the transition method used.
By the end of the year of initial application the balance would increase to 1.71.8 billion retained earnings would be decreased by the range of 100 million maximum  this applies both at the date of initial application and at the end of the year of initial application and the impact on profits for the year of initial application will be a loss ranging between 530 million depending on the transition method used.
In 20192020 the average age of the Groups fleet approximately five years will be around half of the average lease tenure of the fleet approximately ten years which makes the earnings impact for the year of initial application relatively limited 10 million or below in two of the three transition scenarios.

Accounting policies continued Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are all entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Group has the power directly or indirectly to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
The results of all the subsidiaries are consolidated up to 31 March which is the financial year end of the Company.
Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Going concern The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes that the Group will continue in business for the foreseeable future.
This assumption is based on the Directors assessment of the Groups financial performance and position to date together with a review of its forecasts in light of the risks to which the Group is exposed.
Foreign currency The Groups presentational currency is the Euro.
The functional currency of all the Group entities with the exception of Dnieper Aviation LLC and Wizz Air Ukraine Airlines LLC is the Euro.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the statement of financial position date are translated into Euros at the exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as financial income or expense.
Nonmonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and which are recognised at their historical cost are translated into Euros at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Nonmonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and which are stated at fair value are translated into Euros at exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
The functional currency of Dnieper Aviation LLC and Wizz Air Ukraine Airlines LLC is the Ukrainian Hryvnia
The results and financial position of all the Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentational currency are translated into the presentational currency as follows assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that statement of financial position income and expenses for each statement of comprehensive income are translated at monthly average exchange rates unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions and all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity cumulative translation adjustments.
The below exchange rates were used for the translation of UAH into Euros in the respective financial years Closing rate 28.96 29.69 Average rate for the year 28.42 29.26 Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2017 85 ACCOUNTS AND OTHER INFORMATION NOTES FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Accounting policies continued Financial assets and liabilities The Group classifies its financial assets and liabilities  in line with IAS 39 Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement  into the following categories Description in the statement of financial position Category Noncurrent assets Restricted cash Trade and other receivables Loans and receivables Loans and receivables Current assets Trade and other receivables Financial assets available for sale Derivative financial instruments Restricted cash Cash and cash equivalents Loans and receivables Availableforsale assets Fair value through profit or loss Loans and receivables Loans and receivables Noncurrent liabilities
Convertible debts Other financial liabilities measured at amortised cost Other financial liabilities measured at amortised cost Current liabilities Trade and other payables
Convertible debt Derivative financial instruments Other financial liabilities measured at amortised cost Other financial liabilities measured at amortised cost Other financial liabilities measured at amortised cost Fair value through profit or loss The classification of financial assets depends on the purpose for which the assets were acquired.
Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading.
A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term.
Assets in this category are classified as current assets.
Derivatives assets or liabilities are also categorised as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges.
These are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They are included in current assets except for maturities greater than twelve months after the statement of financial position date which are classified as noncurrent assets.
The Groups loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash in the statement of financial position.
Availableforsale financial assets are nonderivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories.
They are included in noncurrent assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within twelve months of the statement of financial position date.
Availableforsale financial assets are subsequently carried at fair value.
Other financial liabilities are nonderivative financial liabilities with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They are included in current liabilities except for maturities greater than twelve months after the statement of financial position date that are classified as noncurrent liabilities.
The Groups other financial liabilities comprise trade and other payables and interestbearing loans and borrowings including convertible debt in the statement of financial position.
The Group invests excess cash in a conservative way primarily in shortterm time deposits and money market funds.
Management does not in the short term plan to have heldtomaturity investments.
The recognition and measurement criteria are described in the relevant accounting policy section.

Accounting policies continued Financial assets and liabilities continued Derivative financial instruments and hedging Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income within financial income or expenses.
However where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged see below.
The Group enters into foreign exchange and jet fuel price hedging transactions to minimise the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and fuel price on the Group.
Both types of hedging transactions are cash flow hedges under IAS 39.
Cash flow hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction the effective part of any unrealised gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in the hedging reserve within other comprehensive income.
Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income as financial income or expenses.
The associated cumulative gain or loss on the effective part is removed from other comprehensive income and recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the respective operating expense lines in the same period or periods as the hedged forecast transaction.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold terminated or exercised or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in other comprehensive income and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the hedged transaction is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income immediately net of tax within the cash flow hedging reserve.
Before expiry the fair value of an option comprises i its intrinsic value being a function of the difference between contracted and market or spot prices and ii its time value being the difference between the fair value and the intrinsic value at any point in time.
Subject to hedge effectiveness any increase or decrease in the intrinsic value of the hedging instrument is taken to equity within other comprehensive income or expense.
However any increase or decrease in the time value of the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income as financial income or expense.
This reflects the fact that variations in the time value of an option are required to be excluded from the hedge relationship in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement.
Accordingly
Initial recognition the open position on the derivative hedging instrument is recorded as an asset or liability in the statement of financial position at fair value.
Subsequent remeasurement of unexpired options i the effective portion of changes in the intrinsic element of the fair value is recorded in other comprehensive income ii changes in the time value element of the fair value or the ineffective portion if any are recorded as financial income or expense in the statement of comprehensive income.
The realised gains or losses on the hedging instrument are recorded against the respective operating expense lines in the statement of comprehensive income.
The ineffective portion is determined in line with IAS 39 applying the 80125 per cent. rule.
The ineffective part of changes in fair value if any is recorded as financial income or expense in the statement of comprehensive income.

Accounting policies continued Financial assets and liabilities continued Derivative financial instruments and hedging continued Hedging with nonderivatives The Group uses its selected financial assets denominated in US Dollars to hedge highly probable future expenses in US Dollar.
The Group applies hedge accounting to part of its nonderivate financial assets in the interest of reducing the amount of unrealised foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from the periodic revaluation of these assets.
The accounting treatment of nonderivatives designated as hedging instruments is identical to cash flow hedges with derivatives that is the unrealised gains or losses on hedging instruments are recorded as an asset or liability in the statement of financial position at fair value and the effective portion of changes in the fair value is recorded in other comprehensive income and the realised gains or losses on the hedging instruments are recorded against the respective expense lines in the statement of comprehensive income.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are stated at their amortised cost using the effective interest rate method less impairment losses.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the trade and other receivables account and the amount of the loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income within other expenses.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against other expenses in the statement of comprehensive income.
Other receivables also comprise insurance claims related to events that are covered by insurance contracts.
The Group recognises the income in the financial statements only from those insurance claims which based on managements judgment are virtually certain to be received by the Group.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits repayable on demand or which mature within three months of inception less any overdrafts repayable on demand.
Cash held in money market funds is also included in cash and cash equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents do not include restricted cash.
Cash and cash equivalents are netted only when right of offset has been obtained.
Restricted cash Restricted cash represents cash deposits held by the banks that cover letters of credit issued by the same bank to certain suppliers.
Restricted cash is split between noncurrent and current assets depending on the maturity period of the underlying letters of credit.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Trade and other payables comprise balances payable to suppliers authorities and employees.
Interestbearing borrowings Interestbearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition interestbearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as a financial expense over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest rate basis.
Financial expenses also include withholding tax paid on the interest if according to the loan agreement the payment of withholding tax is the liability of the Group.
Convertible debt Convertible debt instruments that can be converted to share capital at the option of the holder where the number of shares issued does not vary with changes in their fair value are accounted for as compound instruments.
Transaction costs that relate to the issue of a compound instrument are allocated to the liability and equity components in proportion to the allocation of proceeds.
The liability component is recognised initially at the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an equity conversion option.
The equity component of the compound instrument is calculated as the excess of the issue proceeds over the value of the liability component.
Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2017 88 ACCOUNTS AND OTHER INFORMATION NOTES FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Accounting policies continued Financial assets and liabilities continued Classification of compound instruments issued by the Group Compound instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity i. other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability.
Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Companys own shares the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
Where a compound instrument that contains both equity and financial liability components exists these components are separated by recognising the liability at fair value and accounted for individually under the above policy.
The finance cost on the financial liability component is correspondingly higher over the life of the instrument.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance expenses.
Finance payments associated with compound instruments that are classified in equity are dividends and are recorded directly in equity.
Impairment of financial assets Impairment losses are recognised on financial assets carried at amortised cost where there is objective evidence that a loss has been incurred.
The amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate.
If subsequently the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event that occurred after the impairment was recognised the appropriate portion of the loss is reversed.
Both impairment losses and reversals are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as components of financial income or expenses except in the case of impairment of availableforsale financial assets where the impairment and its reversal may be charged to other comprehensive income under certain circumstances.
Current trade and other receivables are discounted where the effect is material.
Nonfinancial assets and liabilities Property plant and equipment Property plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property plant and equipment have different useful lives they are accounted for as separate items of property plant and equipment.
Depreciation is charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straightline basis to write off cost to residual value over the estimated useful economic lives of each part of an item of property plant and equipment.
In the case of certain aircraft maintenance assets the useful economic life of the asset can be defined in terms of flight hours or flight cycles and in this case the depreciation charge is determined based on the actual number of flight hours or flight cycles.
The estimated useful lives of the relevant asset categories are as follows Land and buildings three to five years being the shorter of useful economic life and the lease term Aircraft maintenance assets two to seven years being the shorter of useful economic life and the lease term Aircraft parts seven years Fixtures and fittings three years The residual values and useful lives are reassessed annually.

Accounting policies continued Nonfinancial assets and liabilities continued Assets received free of charge In certain cases the Group receives assets free of charge.
These are treated as noncash items in the statement of cash flows.
Advances paid for aircraft  predelivery payments PDP Predelivery payments PDP are paid by the Group to aircraft and engine manufacturers for financing the production of the ordered aircraft or spare engine as determined by the contractual terms.
Such advance payments for aircraft or spare engines are recognised at cost and classified as property plant and equipment in the statement of financial position.
The amount is not depreciated.
The Group may enter into sale and leaseback arrangements with lessors to finance future aircraft or spare engine deliveries.
These arrangements are structured such that the right and the commitment to purchase the aircraft or spare engine are assigned to the lessor only on the date of delivery a delivery date assignment as such the recognition and classification of the PDP balance does not change when the sale and leaseback contracts are signed.
On the delivery of the aircraft or spare engine the lessor pays the full purchase price of the asset to the manufacturer and the Group receives from the manufacturer a refund of the PDPs paid.
At this moment the fixed asset is derecognised from the statement of financial position and any gain or loss arising is transferred to the statement of comprehensive income as an operating income or expense.
In some instances PDPs are paid  in the name of the Group  by the lessors directly to the aircraft manufacturer.
These PDPs are also recognised by the Group in the statement of financial position as advances paid for aircraft and as received loans until the delivery of the aircraft.
In the statement of cash flows these PDPs and loans are treated as noncash items and are eliminated both from advances paid for aircraftsrefunds of advances paid for aircraft and commercial loan lines.
Advances paid for aircraft maintenance assets  engine fleet our agreements FHA Advances paid for aircraft maintenance assets represent advance payments made in relation to heavy maintenance scheduled to be performed in the future for the definition of heavy maintenance see the accounting policy section on maintenance.
Such advance payments are made by the Group particularly to the engine maintenance service provider under fleet hour agreements FHA.
The balance of such assets is recategorised into aircraft maintenance assets at the time when the aircraft maintenance asset is recognised in respect of the same component and the same heavy maintenance event.
This is when the component no longer meets the conditions set out in the lease agreement.
Advances paid for aircraft maintenance are not depreciated.
In the statement of cash flows the FHA payments are shown under the purchase of maintenance assets line together with other aircraft maintenance asset purchases.
Intangible assets Intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Web development costs are capitalised to the extent they are expected to generate future economic benefits and meet the other criteria described in IAS 38 Intangible Assets.
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates.
All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.
Amortisation is charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straightline basis over the estimated useful economic lives of intangible assets.
Intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use.
The estimated useful lives are as follows Software licences three to eight years Web and other software development costs three to five years
Inventories mainly spares are purchased for internal use and are stated at cost unless impaired or at net realisable value if any items are to be sold or scrapped.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of the business less the estimated selling expense.
Cost is based on the average price method and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition.

Accounting policies continued Nonfinancial assets and liabilities continued Emissions Trading Scheme As of 1 January 2012 the scope of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme 2008101EC EU ETS covers airlines.
The Group is required to formally report its annual emissions to the relevant authorities and surrender emission allowances EUAs equivalent to the emissions made during the year.
Surrendered allowances are a combination of the free allowances granted by the authorities and allowances purchased by the Group from other parties.
The Group follows the cost method of booking the allowances the free allowances have nil cost value so therefore are not recognised as an asset and allowances purchased in the market are recorded at the purchase price in inventory.
The Group is given free allowances by the competent authorities and the net economic impact to the Group is therefore represented by the shortfall between the actual carbon emitted and the free allowances given to the Group for that period.
The shortfall is recorded at forward prices as a cost.
Application of this accounting treatment means that the statement of comprehensive income and the statement of financial position reflect the net economic impact and are not grossed up to reflect the full obligation.
Deferred interest The Group enters into sale and leaseback agreements to finance future aircraft or spare engine deliveries.
In some cases it also enters into arrangements to finance the PDPs of such deliveries.
Interest accrued on loans to finance the PDPs on aircraft or spare engines is initially recognised under property plant and equipment advances paid for aircraft.
When the leased aircraft or spare engine is delivered the PDP interest balance is reclassified within the statement of financial position from property plant and equipment into deferred interest.
From this point forward the interest is amortised to the statement of comprehensive income during the term of the respective lease contract.
The Group recognises in the deferred interest line also the effect of the discounting adjustment of noncurrent receivables.
Impairment of nonfinancial assets The carrying amounts of the Groups assets are reviewed at each statement of financial position date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to dispose and value in use.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or cashgenerating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Employee benefits Share based payment transactions The Group operates an equitysettled share option programme that allows Group employees to acquire shares in the Company.
The options are granted by the Company.
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The fair value of the options granted is measured using an option valuation model taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted at any measurement date so that the cumulative expense to date reflects the actual number of share options that are expected to vest.
The share award programme allows the Directors of the Company to acquire shares in the Company at nominal value.
The fair value of the awards granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which there are restrictions in place in respect of the transfer of the award shares by the Directors.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pretax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and where appropriate the risks specific to the liability please see further details of aircraft maintenance provisions in the accounting policy section on maintenance.

Accounting policies continued
Revenue comprises the invoiced value of flight seats and ancillary revenues.
Passenger ticket revenue arises from the sale of flight seats and is recognised net of government taxes in the period in which the service is provided that being when the airplane has departed.
Where charges levied by airports or government authorities on a per passenger basis represent a government tax in fact or in substance then such amounts are presented on a net basis in the statement of comprehensive income netted between revenue and airport handling and enroute charges lines.
Unearned revenue represents flight seats sold but not yet flown and is included in deferred income.
Refunds made to passengers are recorded as reductions in revenue.
Ancillary revenue arises from the sale of other services made by the Group and from commissions earned in relation to services sold on behalf of other parties.
Revenues from other services comprise mainly baggage charges bookingpayment handling fees airport checkin fees fees for various convenience services priority boarding extended legroom and reserved seats loyalty programme membership fees and hotel and other services sold by the tour operator unit of the Group.
Commission revenue arises in relation to the sale of on board catering accommodation car rental travel insurance bus transfers premium calls and cobranded credit cards.
Ancillary revenues are recognised as revenue on the date that the right to receive consideration occurs which is the date when the underlying service was provided.
This depending on the type of service might be either the date of sale the date of flight or in the case of membership fees over the period when customers take benefit of a paid membership.
Leases
Finance leases If the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset are substantially transferred to Wizz Air then it is accounted for as a finance lease.
The following five criteria can indicate such situation there is transfer of ownership of the asset at the end of lease term there is option to purchase the asset at sufficiently below fair value therefore it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised the lessee holds the assets for the major part of the assets economic life the asset is so special that it can be used only by the lessee and the present value of minimum lease payments is substantially all of the fair value of the asset.
Management uses the above criteria as guidelines for its analyses however the substance of a transaction is always considered during the assessment.
Management assesses each leasing contract individually at initial recognition based on the above discussed criteria.
Finance leases are capitalised at the leases commencement at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Operating leases Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income on a straightline basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Sale and leaseback transactions The Group enters into transactions whereby it assigns to a third party the right to acquire new aircraft or spare engines.
On delivery of the aircraft or spare engine the Group will lease the aircraft or spare engine back through an operating lease from the same party.
Any gain arising on disposal where the price that the aircraft is sold for is above fair value is recognised initially in deferred income and then amortised on a straightline basis over the lease term of the asset.
Maintenance
Aircraft maintenance provisions For aircraft held under operating lease agreements the Group is contractually committed to either return the aircraft in a certain condition or to compensate the lessor based on the actual condition of the aircraft and its major components upon return.
Provision is made for the minimum unavoidable costs of specific future obligations created by the lease at the time when such obligation becomes certain.
This is when the respective aircraft component no longer meets the lease redelivery conditions.
The provision is used through the completion of a maintenance event such that the component again meets the redelivery conditions.
Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2017 92 ACCOUNTS AND OTHER INFORMATION NOTES FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Accounting policies continued Maintenance continued Aircraft maintenance assets Heavy maintenance relates to the overhaul of engines and associated components the replacement of life limited parts the replacement of landing gears and the nonroutine airframe inspection and rectification works.
Under normal operating conditions heavy maintenance relates to work expected to be performed no more frequently than every two to four years.
The cost of heavy maintenance is capitalised and recognised as a tangible fixed asset and classified as aircraft maintenance assets at the earlier of a the time the lease redelivery condition is no longer met see above under aircraft maintenance provisions or b when maintenance including enhancement is carried out.
Other
Such maintenance assets are depreciated over the period the Group benefits from the asset which is the shorter of a the estimated period until the next date when the lease redelivery condition is no longer met or b the end of the assets operational life or c the end of the lease.
For engines and associated components depreciation is charged on the basis of flight hours or cycles while for other aircraft maintenance assets depreciation is charged evenly over the period the Group expects to derive benefit from the asset.
Components of newly leased aircraft such as life limited parts and engines are not accounted for as separate assets and the inherent benefit of these assets which are utilised in the period from inception of the lease until the time the assets no longer meet the lease redelivery condition is reflected in the payments made to the lessor over the life of the lease.
Aircraft maintenance assets are nonmonetary items.
NonEuro amounts are translated on inception to Euro and are not retranslated.
The recognition of aircraft maintenance assets against provisions for other liabilities and charges in the statement of financial position is a transaction not involving cash flows.
In the statement of cash flows the spending on these assets is presented as purchase of aircraft maintenance assets in the period when cash actually flows out of the Group.
This can happen either before or after the recognition of the asset depending on the exact facts and circumstances associated with the relevant asset or assets.
Please refer also to the property plant and equipment section of accounting policies.
Other receivables from lessors  maintenance reserve Payments for aircraft and engine maintenance as stipulated in the respective operating lease agreements are made to the lessors as a security for the performance of future heavy maintenance works.
The payments are recorded as receivables from the lessors until the respective maintenance event occurs and the reimbursement with the lessor is finalised.
Any payment that is not expected to be reimbursed by the lessor is recognised within operating expenses aircraft rentals in the statement of comprehensive income.
Other
The Group enters into agreements with maintenance service providers that guarantee the maintenance of major components at a rate defined in the contract the prime example being fleet hour agreements FHAs for aircraft engines.
Such FHAs cover the cost of both scheduled and unscheduled engine overhauls.
FHA payments are accounted for as follows Payments for scheduled maintenance work are recognised as advances paid for aircraft maintenance assets until the maintenance asset for the respective engine overhaul is created.
After this point any further FHA payments are either used to settle previously established aircraft maintenance provisions to the extent a provision for the respective FHA contract exists or in the absence of a provision are added to the amount previously capitalised within property plant and equipment as advances paid for aircraft maintenance assets.
Payments that are made to provide guaranteed coverage for the performance of unscheduled maintenance events are considered as insurance payments and are expensed as incurred.
Please refer to the property plant and equipment section of accounting policies.

Accounting policies continued Supplier credits The Group receives certain assets cash contributions or aircraft spares for nil consideration in connection with its acquisition of aircraft and of major aircraft parts.
Cash contributions or aircraft spares received are recognised as an asset in the statement of financial position.
The corresponding credits are recognised as income spread equally across the shorter of useful economic life and the lease term of the respective aircraft.
In certain cases the concessions receivable from a component manufacturer are linked to the Groups commitment to purchase a number of new aircraft with the manufacturers components installed on those.
In such case in substance the right to the concessions is earned by the Group through the delivery of the respective aircraft.
In certain cases the concessions might be delivered by the component manufacturer later than the date when the respective aircraft is taken by the Group.
If so then the right earned for the concession is recognised at the date of the aircraft delivery as part of trade and other receivables with a corresponding credit to deferred income.
Following this the credits are amortised on a straightline basis over the lease term of the respective asset decreasing aircraft rental expenses.
Net financing costs Net financing costs comprise interest payable finance charges on finance leases interest receivable on funds invested and foreign exchange gains and losses that are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Interest income and interest payable are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income using the effective interest method.
Noncash elements of financial income and expenses are eliminated from the statement of cash flows as an adjusting item whereas cash elements e. statement of cash flows.
Share capital Ordinary Shares are classified as equity.
Qualifying transaction costs directly attributable to the issuing of new shares are debited to equity reducing the share premium arising on the issue of shares.
Taxation
Taxation on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year using tax rates enacted at the statement of financial position date and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for the initial recognition of goodwill the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that sufficient future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.

Accounting policies continued Exceptional items Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the financial statements where it is necessary to do so to provide further understanding of the financial performance of the Group.
They are material items of income or expense that are shown separately due to the significance of their nature or amount.
Underlying profit after tax is a nonstatutory profit measure introduced by the Company to help investors better understand the trading performance of the Group.
It is a measure used by the Company also in determining the variable remuneration of senior management see Shortterm Incentive Plan or annual bonus in the Directors Remuneration Report.
Underlying profit excludes the effect of exceptional items and of unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses.
These items for various reasons had significant impact particularly during the 20152017 financial years.
Going forward the Company expects that it will not incur exceptional items of recurring nature so there would be no difference between IFRS and underlying earnings.
Segment reporting Operating and reportable segments The Group has two reportable segments the airline and the tour operator business units marketed under the Wizz Air and Wizz Tours brand names respectively.
Wizz Air sells flight tickets and related services to external customers and to a smaller extent to Wizz Tours.
Wizz Tours sells travel packages to external customers covering the network of Wizz Air.
Management information is provided to the senior management team which in the context of IFRS 8 Operating segments is the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
Resource allocation decisions are made by the CODM for the benefit of the route network as a whole rather than for individual routes within the network.
The performance of the network is assessed primarily based on the operating profit or loss for the period.
Financial risk management Financial risk factors The Group is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices interest rates and currency exchange rates.
The objective of financial risk management at Wizz Air is to minimise the impact of commodity price interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the Groups earnings cash flows and equity.
To manage commodity and foreign exchange risks Wizz Air uses various derivative financial instruments including foreign currency and commodity zerocost collar contracts.
Risk management is carried out by the treasury department under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
The Board provides written principles for overall risk management as well as written policies covering specific areas such as foreign exchange risk fuel price risk credit risk use of derivative financial instruments adherence to hedge accounting and hedge coverage levels.
The Board has mandated the Audit Committee of the Board to supervise the hedging activity of the Group and the compliance with the policies approved by the Board.
Risk analysis Market risks Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales purchases and commitments that are denominated in a currency other than the Euro.
The foreign currency exposure of the Group is significant for two reasons i only a small portion of the Groups revenues are denominated in or linked to the US Dollar while a significant portion of the Groups expenses are US Dollar denominated including fuel aircraft leases maintenance reserves and aviation insurance and ii there are various currencies in which the Group has significantly more revenues than expenses primarily the British Pound GBP and  to a smaller extent  the Polish Zloty PLN.
The Group chooses the EuroUSD foreign currency rate as the major underlying foreign currency pair in its foreign currency rate hedging strategies.
The main objective is to cover the Groups ongoing US Dollar cash flow requirements.
The Groups maximum hedge coverage level is 85 per cent. purchases hedged by the time the respective quarter on a monthly rolling forward basis is reached.
This maximum target hedge coverage level was 75 per cent. until January 2017 when it was increased to 85 per cent. as a result of the revision of the Groups Hedging Policy in January 2017.
These levels were not always reached during the current or prior years.
The new Hedging Policy defines also the hedging of the GBPEuro foreign currency rate exposure as a new measure of risk management.
The Groups maximum target coverage on this currency pair is 60% on a rolling twelvemonth basis but no transaction was made until 31 March 2017.

If the net balance of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies is high then this translation process can result in material volatility to financial income and expense and thus to earnings.
Historically the Group had a high balance of net monetary assets denominated in US Dollars and this resulted in significant unrealised foreign exchange gains as in 2015 and losses as in 2016.
By the end of the 2016 financial year the US Dollar monetary assetliability position of the Group became materially balanced therefore starting from financial year 2017 there are no material foreign exchange gains or losses incurred by the Group.
This balanced position is not visible from the table above that shows a net asset balance of US Dollar denominated financial instruments of 111.9 million in 2017.
The two positions can be reconciled as follows the 2017 balance of trade and other receivables denominated in US Dollars includes 22.1 million that has been designated for hedge accounting and therefore its foreign currency revaluation is not impacting financial income or expenses  see under foreign exchange hedge with nonderivatives later in this Note 3 and at 31 March 2017 the Group had provisions of 84.5 million denominated in US Dollars as part of the total 113.7 million balance reported in Note 29.

Financial risk management continued Risk analysis continued Market risks continued Interest rate risk The Group has future commitments under certain operating lease contracts that are based on floating interest rates.
The floating nature of the interest charges on the operating leases exposes the Group to interest rate risk.
Interest rates charged on convertible debt liabilities and on short and longterm loans to finance the deposits of aircraft are not sensitive to interest rate movements as they are fixed until maturity.
See Notes 23 and 24.
The Group is also exposed to interest rate risk in relation to the valuation of financial instruments as they are carried at fair value.
The Group has not used financial derivatives to hedge its interest rate risk during the year.
The Directors may in the future consider hedging interest rate risk to reduce the potential Group earnings volatility arising from fluctuations in interest rates.
Commodity risks One of the most significant costs for the Group is jet fuel.
The price of jet fuel can be volatile and can directly impact the Groups financial performance.
The Groups maximum hedge coverage is 70 per cent. basis and 60 per cent. on a rolling 18month basis.
These represent 10 percentage point increase versus earlier levels as a result of the revision of the Groups Hedging Policy in January 2017.
The average hedge coverage in F17 was 51 per cent. and 38 per cent. respectively.
Hedge transactions during the periods The Group uses nonderivatives and zerocost collar instruments to hedge its foreign exchange exposures and uses zerocost collar and outright cap instruments to hedge its jet fuel exposures.
The time horizon of the hedging programme with derivatives is usually up to a maximum of 18 months however this horizon can be exceeded at the Boards discretion.
The volume of hedge transactions that expired during the periods was as follows a Foreign exchange hedge USD versus EUR US333.5 million 2016 US339.0 million.
475000 metric tons 2016 439500 metric tons.
Hedge yearend open positions At the end of the year and the prior year the Group had the following open hedge positions a Foreign exchange hedge with derivatives The fair value of the open positions was a 5.8 million gain 2016 4.8 million recognised within other comprehensive income current assets or current liabilities respectively.
The notional amount of the open positions was US297 million 2016 US313.5 million.
The notional amount of the open positions was US238.5 million 2016 US190.5 million.
Nonderivatives are existing financial assets that hedge highly probable foreign currency cash flows in the future and therefore act as a natural hedge.
At the end of the year out of its nonderivative financial assets position the Group had US23.6 million designated for hedge accounting 2016 US34.5 million.
The rest of the open positions relate to expected PDP refunds 2017 US214.9 million 2016 US156.0 million for which no hedge accounting is applied.
The fair value of the open positions was a 2.5 million gain 2016 11.4 million loss recognised within other comprehensive income and current assets or liabilities respectively.
The notional amount of the open positions was 598000 metric tons 2016 449000 metric tons.
In relation to these open hedge positions the cash flows will occur and the hedge relationships will impact the statement of comprehensive income during the year ending 31 March 2018.
Hedge effectiveness During the year covered by these financial statements based on the evaluation of the Group the hedging transactions did not give rise to material ineffectiveness under IAS 39.
As explained below in the credit risk section in the opinion of the management none of the hedge counterparties had a material change in their credit status that would have influenced the effectiveness of the hedging transactions.

Financial risk management continued Risk analysis continued Market risks continued Sensitivity analysis The table below shows the sensitivity of the Groups profits to various markets risks for the current and the prior year.
2017 2016 Difference in profit after tax in  million Difference in profit after tax in  million Fuel price sensitivity Fuel price 100 higher per metric ton Fuel price 100 lower per metric ton FX rate sensitivity USDEUR FX rate 0.05 higher meaning EUR stronger FX rate 0.05 lower FX rate sensitivity GBPEUR FX rate 0.03 higher meaning EUR stronger FX rate 0.03 lower FX rate sensitivity PLNEUR FX rate 0.15 higher meaning EUR stronger FX rate 0.15 lower Interest rate sensitivity EUR Interest rate is higher by 100 bps Interest rate is lower by 100 bps The interest rate sensitivity calculation considers the effects of varying interest rates on the interest income on bank deposits and on the expense from floating lease rentals.
The impact of these macroeconomic variables on equity is the same as the impact on profit after tax except for the fuel price and for the USDEUR FX rate variables where the equity impact would also include the change in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments that are open at the year end.
The fair value of these instruments was provided by the hedge counterparties and management has not calculated the theoretical value of these instruments for other scenarios.
Liquidity risks Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and the availability of funding.
The Group has an adequate liquidity position.
In previous years the Group invested excess cash EUR in a conservative way primarily in AAArated money market funds and also in shortterm time deposits with high quality bank counterparties.
In F17 as EUR yields went deeper into negative territory management  supported by the Board  decided to withdraw all funds from money market funds and placed it in plain vanilla deposit structures with various counterparties.
The table below analyses the Groups financial assets and liabilities receivable or payable either on cash base or netsettled derivative financial assets and liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the statement of financial position date to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table below are the contractual undiscounted cash flows except for derivatives where fair values are presented.
Therefore for certain asset and liability categories the amounts presented in this table can be different from the respective amounts presented in the statement of financial position.

The Company provided guarantees to third parties to guarantee the performance of its airline subsidiary in relation to aircraft lease contracts on a regular basis and from 2017 also in relation to a contract for the provision of public services in Hungary.
These possible obligations are disclosed in the table above with the shortest maturity under the financial guarantees line.
Management does not expect that any payment under these guarantee contracts will be required by the Company.
Other financial guarantee contracts relate to hedging and convertible notes.
The respective liabilities are reflected under the appropriate line of the financial liabilities part of the table above.
Since the liability itself is already reflected in the table it would not be appropriate to include also the financial guarantee provided by another Group entity for the same obligation.
Credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk from individual customers is limited as the large majority of the payments for flight tickets are collected before the service is provided.
However the Group has significant banking hedging aircraft manufacturer and card acquiring relationships that represent counterparty credit risk.
The Group analysed the creditworthiness of the relevant business partners in order to assess the likelihood of nonperformance of liabilities due to the Group.
The credit quality of the Groups financial assets is assessed by reference to external credit ratings published by Standard and Poors or similar institutions of the counterparties as follows AAA AA A A Other Unrated Total At 31 March 2017  million  million  million  million  million  million  million Financial assets Trade and other receivables   1.6  2.0 205.1 208.6 Derivative financial assets   6.5 2.1 1.5  10.0 Financial assets available for sale  1.0     1.0 Cash and cash equivalents 0.5  622.5 100.0 50.7 0.3 774.0 Restricted cash   155.9    155.9 Total financial assets 0.5 1.0 786.4 102.1 54.2 205.4 1149.6 AAA AA A A Other Unrated Total At 31 March 2016  million  million  million  million  million  million  million Financial assets Trade and other receivables     18.6 179.1 197.7 Derivative financial assets   1.6 0.1   1.7 Financial assets available for sale  1.0     1.0 Cash and cash equivalents 547.5  96.8   1.3 645.6 Restricted cash   101.0   0.6 101.6 Total financial assets 547.5 1.0 199.4 0.1 18.6 181.0 947.6 At 31 March 2016 Within three months million Between three months and one year million Between one and five years million More than five years million

Financial risk management continued Credit risk continued The Other column in 2017 includes 52.2 million balance out of which 50.0 million is bank deposit with one of the banking partners of the Group that has BBB rating.
The analysis demonstrates the shift in the Groups cash management strategy from moneymarket funds MMF towards bank deposits during the 2017 financial year.
While at the beginning of the year most of Groups free cash was held in AAArated MMFs by the end of the year due to pressures in the yieldenvironment these funds were fully moved into bank deposits most of these being Arated.
From the unrated category within trade and other receivables the Group has 110.3 million 2016 97.3 million receivables from different aircraft lessors in respect of maintenance reserves and lease security deposits paid see also Note 18.
However given that the Group physically possesses the aircraft owned by the lessors and that the Group has significant future lease payment obligations towards the same lessors see Note 32 management does not consider the credit risk on maintenance reserve receivables to be material.
Based on the information above management does not consider the counterparty risk of either party being material and therefore no fair value adjustment was applied to the respective cash or receivable balances.
Fair value estimation The Group classifies its financial instruments based on the technique used for determining fair value into the following categories Level 1 Fair value is determined based on quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 Fair value is determined based on inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 Fair value is determined based on inputs that are not based on observable market data that is on unobservable inputs.
The following table presents the Groups financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at 31 March 2017.
Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total million  million  million  million
Financial assets available for sale 1.0   1.0 Derivative financial instruments  10.1  10.1
Derivative financial instruments  1.9  1.9 Financial assets available for sale represents a unitlinked insurance invested in government bonds by the insurer.
These government bonds are traded in an active market therefore it falls into the Level 1 category.
The Group measures its derivative financial instruments at fair value calculated with a technique by the banks involved in the hedging transactions that falls into the Level 2 category.
All the other financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost.
Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for Shareholders to provide benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
The capital structure of the Group consists of financial liabilities cash and cash equivalents and equity.
Financial liabilities primarily consist of commercial loans relating to aircraft financing and convertible debt as disclosed in Notes 23 and 24 respectively.
Equity comprises issued capital reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the statement of changes in equity.
Since the financial year beginning on 1 April 2007 the Groups growth has been financed entirely out of cash from operations and commercial debt with financial institutions.
The overall capital risk management strategy remains unchanged from prior years.
Management reviews the Groups cost of capital on an ongoing basis as well as the risks associated with each capital instrument and makes recommendations to the Board for approval.

Critical accounting estimates and judgments made in applying the Groups accounting policies a Maintenance policy For aircraft held under operating lease agreements provision is made for the minimum unavoidable costs of specific future obligations created by the lease at the time when such obligation becomes certain.
The amount of the provision involves making estimates of the cost of the heavy maintenance work that is required to discharge the obligation including any end of lease costs.
The cost of heavy maintenance is capitalised and recognised as a tangible fixed asset and classified as an aircraft maintenance asset at the earlier of a the time the lease redelivery condition is no longer met or b when maintenance including enhancement is carried out.
The calculation of the depreciation charge on such assets involves making estimates for the future utilisation of the aircraft and in the case of engines also of the future operating conditions of the engine.
Fair value of derivatives namely the open position of cash flow hedges is determined by the contracting financial institutions as per their industry practice.
As required the fair values ascribed to those instruments are verified also by management using highlevel models.
Further the effectiveness of hedges is tested both prospectively and retrospectively to determine the appropriate accounting treatment of hedge gains and losses.
The Groups accounting policy stipulates that where charges levied by airports or government authorities on a per passenger basis represent a government tax in fact or in substance then such amounts are presented on a net basis in the statement of comprehensive income netted between the revenue and the airport handling and enroute charges lines.
Management reviews all passengerbased charges levied by airports and government authorities to ensure that any amounts recovered from passengers in respect of these charges are appropriately classified within the statement of comprehensive income.
Given the variability of these charges and the number of airports and jurisdictions within which the Group operates the assessment of whether these items constitute taxes in nature is an inherently complex area requiring a level of judgment.
The Group operates the Wizz Discount Club WDC loyalty program for its customers.
Under this program customers can pay an annual membership fee with the key benefit that during most of the twelvemonth membership period they get access to special fares that are lower than the standard ticket prices.
The Group recognises the revenue from the membership fees following the pattern of customers taking benefits from the program.
This pattern is determined by management once a year on the basis of the actual distribution of member flights in the preceding twelve months and then applied prospectively.
It is unlikely that there would be a material change in the pattern within one year because the underlying fact patterns for customers to buy membership to buy tickets and then to fly those tickets are reasonably stable.
The WDC program was introduced by the Group in 2012 and had insignificant impact initially.
Management used to recognise membership revenues on a straightline basis in the twelvemonth membership period.
In the last few years the number of members and thus also the level of membership revenues picked up and it also became visible that the actual pattern how customers take the membership benefits is significantly different from the straightline method.
Therefore starting from 2017 management started to apply a revenue recognition pattern matching the historic pattern of how customers were taking the benefits of the program.
This change in estimates combined with some other changes related to this area resulted in 7.9 million additional revenue for 2017.

Segment information Reportable segment information The chief operating decision maker CODM of the Group as defined in IFRS 8 Operating segments is the senior management team of the Group.
The Group has two reportable segments the airline and the tour operator business units marketed under the Wizz Air and Wizz Tours brand names respectively.
Wizz Air sells flight tickets and related services to external customers and to a smaller extent to Wizz Tours.
Wizz Tours sells travel packages to external customers covering the network of Wizz Air.
The Group classified the tour operator business as a separate reportable segment starting from 1 April 2016.
The Wizz Tours brand was launched already in 2013 but initially the travel packages were sold by a thirdparty tour operator partner.
During this period the financial impact of the tour operator activity was insignificant.
The Group started its own tour operator activity in October 2015.
Therefore no comparative information is reported for the prior period.

Major customers The Group derives the vast majority of its revenues from its passengers and sells most of its tickets directly to the passengers as final customers rather than through corporate intermediaries tour operators travel agents or similar.
Therefore the Group does not have any major corporate customers.

Exceptional items and underlying profit Exceptional items Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the financial statements where it is necessary to do so to provide further understanding of the financial performance of the Group.
They are material items of income or expense that have been shown separately due to the significance of their nature or amount.
In the 2017 and 2016 financial years all items classified by the Group as exceptional related to financial income or expenses.
In the 2017 financial year the Group had a net exceptional income of 18.8 million consisting of i exceptional gain of 14.3 million relating to the change in time value of open hedge positions particularly on fuel caps and ii exceptional income of 4.5 million relating to closing of fuel cap deals.
According to the contracts the fuel caps had their expiry dates in the second half of the financial year October 2016 to February 2017 however they were sold in order to enable the Group to enter into new deals zero cost collars at more favourable rates without breaching the fuel hedge coverage limits set in the Hedging Policy of the Group.
The net 4.5 million gain consisted of time value gain of 16.8 million coming from the reversal of time value losses previously accumulated on these instruments the writing off of option fee costs of 12.4 million and sale proceeds of 0.2 million.
In the 2016 financial year the Group had an exceptional expense of 16.3 million consisting of i exceptional expense of 25.0 million relating to the change in time value of open hedge positions particularly on fuel caps and ii exceptional income of 8.7 million relating to a realised foreign exchange gain arising on a oneoff replacement of US75.6 million bank deposits behind collaterals with Euro deposits.
These items were used by management in the determination of the nonGAAP underlying profit measure for the Group  see below.
Underlying profit 2017 2016 million  million Profit for the period 246.0 192.9 Adjustments exclusions Unrealised foreign exchange gainloss 1.9 14.7 Exceptional items net gainloss 18.8 16.3 Sum of adjustments Underlying profit after tax On top of the exceptional items explained above unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses are also excluded from the calculation of underlying profit.
These are noncash translation differences that arise primarily on the revaluation of the net US Dollar monetary asset position of the Group that used to be material until 2016.
The unrealised loss of 14.7 million in 2016 related primarily to the conversion of US75.6 million collaterals into Euros.
This transaction alone resulted in an 8.7 million realised foreign exchange gain on one hand explained above among exceptional items and a 12.4 million unrealised foreign exchange loss on the other hand the latter being the reversal of the unrealised gains recognised on these assets since their initial recognition.
That is the net foreign exchange impact of this conversion in 2016 was a 3.7 million loss  all included in the adjustments in the table above.
By the end of the 2016 financial year the US Dollar monetary assetliability position of the Group became materially balanced therefore starting from financial year 2017 there are no material movements in this area.
The tax effects of the adjustments made above are insignificant.

Net financing income and expense continued Interest income and expense contain interest on financial instruments and under the Other category the effect of the initial discounting of longterm deposits and the later unwinding of such discounting.
The fuel caps premium of 9.0 million in 2017 and 5.3 million in 2016 relate to the option fees for fuel caps expired in the periods  these were paid in the 2015 financial year.
Out of the unrealised foreign exchange loss of 14.7 million in 2016 12.4 million was caused by the replacement of US Dollar bank deposits behind collaterals with Euro deposits.
This is because the unrealised foreign exchange gain recognised on these assets until March 2015 had to be reversed due to their de recognition  see also in Note 9.

These shares are nonparticipating i. the profit attributable to them is nil.
Therefore these shares are not included in the basic earnings per share calculation above.
Diluted earnings per share Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue with the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares that could have been issued in the respective year as a result of the conversion of the following convertible instruments of the Group Convertible Shares see Note 28 Convertible Notes see Note 24 and employee share options see Note 27 vested share options are included in the calculation.

Earnings per share continued Proforma earnings per share continued The calculation of the proforma underlying EPS is different from the calculation of the IFRSdiluted EPS measure in the following for earnings the underlying profit for the year was used see Note 9 as opposed to the statutory IFRS profit for the year and for the fully diluted number of shares the yearend position was taken rather than the weighted average for the year.
The proforma EPS measure was introduced by the Company to better reflect the underlying earnings and the underlying equity structure particularly to remove the distortion caused by the special conversion restrictions existing for convertible debt until the IPO in March 2015.
The latter issue was relevant last in 2015.
Since the 2016 financial year the same instruments were in place both during the year and at the end of the year therefore the fully diluted share number was materially the same in the diluted and proforma EPS calculations.

Most of this increase was related to the delivery of various spare engines from IAE.
Additions to aircraft maintenance assets were 69.9 million 2016 41.1 million.
The increase is due to the fact that there were significantly more enginerelated new assets created in 2017 because i there were more engines becoming out of condition for LLP replacement than in 2016 ii in 2016 the Company revised its engine maintenance plan combined with a new IAE FHA agreement see the 2016 report for details and as a result only a few engines became out of condition for shop visit in that period  instead most of these became out of condition in 2017 and iii the Group has a few engines that require second shop visit and these all became out of condition and partly already went through the shop visit in 2017.

Tax assets and liabilities continued Unrecognised deferred tax assets Until 31 March 2010 Wizz Air Hungary was Hungarian tax resident and up to this date had accumulated a 30.0 million tax loss in Hungary.
This balance remained unchanged at 31 March 2017.
This loss can be utilised only to offset profits generated under Hungarian tax residency.
The Group does not expect to have profit generated under Hungarian tax residency in the foreseeable future and therefore no deferred tax asset is recognised in this respect.

The carrying value less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values due to the shortterm nature of trade receivables and payables.
Longterm financial assets and liabilities which are classified as fair value through profit and loss are recognised on fair value.
Trade and other receivables due after more than one year are almost exclusively maintenance reserves with an average term of approximately four years.
The fair value of these assets is determined by discounting at a rate of interest of fouryears US Dollar swap rate prevailing on the last day of the financial year.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is based on their actual marktomarket evaluation of the financial institutions.
During the year a 24.5 million loss 2016 71.0 million was realised on derivative financial assets and liabilities in the income statement.
During the year a 16000 gain 2016 48000 loss was realised on financial assets available for sale.

Contingent liabilities Legal disputes European Commission state aid investigations Six of the European Commissions ongoing state aid investigations which are in their formal phase concern arrangements between Wizz Air and certain airports to which it flies namely Timioara ClujNapoca Trgu Mure Beauvais and Girona.
Wizz Air has submitted its legal observations and supporting economic analyses of these arrangements to the European Commission.
Ultimately an adverse decision by the European Commission could result in a repayment order for the recovery from Wizz Air of any amount determined by the European Commission to be illegal state aid.
None of these ongoing investigations are expected to lead to exposure that is material to the Group.
The European Commission has given notice that the state aid investigations involving Wizz Air will be assessed on the basis of new EU Guidelines on State aid to airports and airlines which were adopted by the European Commission on 20 February 2014.
Where relevant Wizz Air has made further submissions to the European Commission in connection with this notification.
Claims by Carpatair Carpatair a regional airline based in Romania started a number of cases in the Romanian courts during 2012 and 2013 which relate to Carpatairs allegations that Timioara airport granted unlawful state aid to Wizz Air pursuant to an agreement between the parties or by virtue of the publicly available scheme of charges published by Timioara airport.
Wizz Air is intervening in the defence of these claims either in its own right or in support of Timioara airport.
One of these cases determined that state aid existed in the 2010 scheme of charges but failed to substantiate that decision or to quantify the amount involved.
Following this decision Carpatair began a case in which both Timioara airport and Wizz Air are named as defendants and pursuant to which Carpatair aims to have the alleged state aid under the 2010 scheme of charges quantified and a repayment order issued.
Wizz Air understands that the Romanian Chamber of Accounts has issued a decision requiring Timioara airport to recover from Wizz Air an amount of approximately 3 million in respect of the state aid attributable to the 2010 and 2011 scheme of charges despite there having been no expert quantification of the amount and the airport has now started proceedings which Wizz Air is defending.
In January 2016 Carpatair filed a new legal action  registered with the Bucharest Tribunal  against Timioara airport the Romanian Ministry of Transports the Ministry of Public Finances representing the Romanian State and Wizz Air.
By the said legal action Carpatair asked the court to order the four defendants to pay jointly to Carpatair damages preliminarily estimated to amount to 92 million and interest related to the said amount resulting from alleged state aid granted by Timioara airport to Wizz Air from the existence of a marketing agreement between Timioara airport and Wizz Air and from an abuse of dominant position on the part of Timioara airport.

Contingent liabilities continued Legal disputes continued Claims by Carpatair continued The courts decision delivered on 20 December 2016 upheld the objection raised by the Company that the Bucharest Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to hear the case and that the case should be heard by the Administrative Litigation Section of the Bucharest Court of Appeals.
The case was therefore forwarded to the Bucharest Court of Appeals  Administrative and Fiscal Litigation Section where a hearing is scheduled on 18 May 2017.
Management estimates that the maximum potential exposure for these cases could be in the region of 113 million including the 3 million and the 92 million specifically mentioned above.
No provision has been made by the Group in relation to these issues because there is currently no reason to believe that the Group will incur charges from these cases.
