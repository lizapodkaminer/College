Significant increase in the Groups capital investment programme in the year to 10.9m.
Key projects delivered in the latter part of the year will support further cost reductions improved operational efficiency and enhanced product quality and service improvements.
Investment in sales and marketing activities in support of organic growth is demonstrating results particularly in Chain Europe.
Successful disposal of the former European Distribution Centre in Seclin France.
Completion of the sale and shortterm leaseback of the Australian property at Mulgrave Melbourne ahead of relocating the facility.
Together these disposals generated net cash proceeds of 10.2m.
Successful integration of Renold Tooth Chain following last years acquisition.
Renold Tooth Chain continues to trade ahead of expectations.
Chart shows an estimate of the average underlying monthly sales required for the Group to deliver a breakeven adjusted operating profit.
The estimate is based on actual variable margin in the years in question so that when the actual fixed costs are deducted the resulting adjusted operating profit is nil.
The resulting sales figure is then divided by 12 calendar months to arrive at the level of monthly sales required to breakeven.
The breakeven point at March 2017 reflects the increased fixed cost acquired with Renold Tooth Chain along with increased commercial and marketing activities.
These factors increase the breakeven point but are partially offset by ongoing operational improvements.

We continue to deliver key elements of our STEP 2020 Strategic Plan invest in our future and produce encouraging results in volatile market conditions.
AR 2017 Proof 3
Renold has performed robustly this year against a backdrop of challenging markets.
A first half decline in revenues was followed by a return to underlying growth in the second half.
Further selfhelp measures have been delivered this year which reflect our ongoing commitment to the core objectives of our STEP 2020 Strategic Plan.
These include the completion of two consolidation projects the sale of two major properties in France and Australia and the successful integration of the Tooth Chain acquisition which continues to trade ahead of expectations.
We believe this sets a template for further successful acquisitions in the remaining years of the plan.
Our Markets Renolds global presence and extensive product offering result in a broad spread of endcustomer industries.
Customers are served either directly or through distribution partners and our products are used to satisfy maintenance and repair requirements in addition to supporting the manufacture of new equipment.
Our endcustomers generally operate in industrial markets which have continued to be impacted by broader macroeconomic factors and geopolitical uncertainty.
During the year market conditions proved particularly challenging in North America impacting upon both Chain and Torque Transmission operations in the region and resulting in a combined 8% decline in regional revenue.
Europe and China experienced growth and in flat markets we believe this is a result of improving market share arising from the various actions implemented in our STEP 2020 Strategic Plan.
Conditions in certain sectors demonstrated early signs of improvement towards the end of the financial year.
It is too early to determine whether this is a sustained improvement in market conditions or whether this is another phase of volatility in the cycle.
Whatever the case our focus on delivering the underlying improvements required to deliver sustainable progress in operating margins continues.
Trading Performance Revenue grew by 11.0% in the year benefiting from foreign exchange tailwinds and continued strong performance of the Tooth Chain business acquired in January 2016.
On an underlying basis and excluding the impact of acquisitions revenue declined by 3.6% in the year.
This decline reflects the continuation into the current year of the challenging market conditions which impacted performance in the second half of the prior year.
This underlying reduction in revenue resulted in a decline in our adjusted underlying operating margin in the year which fell to 7.9% from 8.6% in the prior year.
Whilst this is disappointing it is reflective of external market factors and our decision to make revenue investments to increase our sales and marketing activities.
We continue to focus attention on delivering actions that will provide sustainable improvements in operating margins and have made good progress in these areas during the year.
The year to March 2017 is the fourth year of our STEP 2020 Strategic Plan.
The Group has come a long way and delivered a great deal over these four years.
The full benefit of the actions delivered to date have been diluted by challenging conditions in our enduser markets over the last two years.
In spite of this we remain confident that we can deliver sustainable midteens margins the exact timing of which will be determined by a recovery in volumes.
STEP 2020 Strategic Plan Further key projects have been successfully delivered as part of our STEP 2020 Strategic Plan.
These include the consolidation of the European Distribution Centre with the sister facility in Germany and the successful transfer of all UK Couplings manufacturing and associated processing into our existing Cardiff site.
Furthermore we have commenced a programme to relocate our Chain China manufacturing facilities from Hangzhou to a purpose built facility near Changzhou in Jiangsu province.
This is a multiyear project which will see the construction of the new facility commence during the year ending March 2018 with the factory relocation expected to occur in the following year.
We have continued to invest in the commercial and marketing activities which we believe will drive organic growth.
We are starting to see the benefit of these actions with underlying revenue growth in Chain Europe excluding acquisitions of 5.9%.
CHAIRMANS LETTER Renold plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 for the year ended 31 March 2017 Renold AR2017Proof3.
6 672017 25641 PM 2529004 AR 2017 Proof 3 A number of important health and safety initiatives have continued through the year and I am very pleased that we have again seen further improvements in our health and safety culture and performance.
Health and safety rightly remains the number one priority for the Board and the Group.
Ongoing and new initiatives in this area will continue to drive further improvements.
Board and People This year saw the appointment of Ian Scapens as Group Finance Director after Brian Tenner left in order to pursue other opportunities.
Ian Scapens brings extensive experience in all aspects of financial leadership in large complex organisations.
He joined Renold from Keepmoat Group the UKs leading national provider of social housing refurbishment and regeneration services and a developer of lowcost affordable housing where he was Deputy Chief Financial Officer.
Also during the year we welcomed David Landless as NonExecutive Director.
He has significant experience at senior levels of international manufacturing businesses.
Most recently he was Group Finance Director of Bodycote plc from 1999 until his retirement earlier this year.
David will take over the Chairmanship of the Audit Committee from John Allkins at the completion of the 2017 AGM.
John will continue as a NonExecutive Director until his retirement from the Board after the 2018 AGM.
I am delighted that both Ian and David have joined the Board.
They bring a wealth of relevant experience which will stand the Board in good stead as we continue to implement our STEP 2020 Strategic Plan.
I would also like to take the opportunity to thank Brian Tenner for his substantial contribution to Renold over the years.
The Board continues to support the Executive team in reviewing and monitoring all activities under STEP 2020.
The Board remains closely involved in the oversight of the major project deliverables.
All Board members have continued to give additional time and support on a wide range of issues during the year.
On behalf of the whole Board I would like to express my gratitude and thanks to all our employees for their continued hard work during the year.
The contribution of each employee is valued and appreciated.

The Groups gross retirement benefit obligations increased to 102.0m 2016 82.9m with the largest element of the increase relating to changes in the discount rates and inflation rates applied as assumptions to assess future liabilities of the UK scheme.
This is a reduction of 10.4m from the position at 30 September 2016.
The Group remains committed to progressively derisking this position over time through a combination of agreed contributions to the schemes and specific derisking projects as they become viable.
Dividend
The Board has decided not to recommend the payment of a dividend.
Whilst the Board fully recognises the importance of dividends to shareholders it believes that the investment opportunities available to the Group continue to provide the optimal route to increasing shareholder value.
This approach will remain under active review for future periods.
Summary
Market conditions remained volatile in the year.
Trading conditions particularly in North America and SouthEast Asia remained challenging.
Early signs of recovery are evident and are supporting growth in order intake but it is too soon for these to be considered sustainable or market wide.
We have not allowed a challenging market to stand in the way of delivery of the STEP 2020 Strategic Plan and have delivered significant business change in the year.
We are making good progress and continue to believe that midteens operating margins can be delivered supported by volume increases.

In addition to the wide range of standard products manufactured at our Einbeck German plant we have an increasing demand for special chains which are designed to specific customer requirements.
In order to economically fulfil these demands Renold has chosen innovative automation processes in assembly and chain production including industrial robotic solutions.
The automation department combines classical mechanical engineering with new control systems.
The key is the knowledge of chain production based on long standing experience in the Group.
This is combined with new automation methods to guarantee a quick and flexible response to market requirements to always stay ahead of competition.
The entire project planning from development and design to assembly as well as programming of new robot lines is undertaken inhouse.
In addition to robotics the Einbeck automation team has expanded focus into the wider production area.
Internally
Visual inspection systems with modern industrial image processing are used to ensure a constant quality level in production.
The inspection systems control the complete feeding and correct positioning of parts and guarantee process reliability in all steps.
Speed and precision of camera systems make it possible to measure individual parts in line with the production process.

See page 49 for more details on these KPIs.
Lost time accident frequency rates Over a 12 month period this contrasts the total number of lost time accidents irrespective of severity against the hours worked.
An internationally recognised standard measure.
Reportable injury rates Over a 12 month period this contrasts the number of accidents greater than three lost days against the average number of employees in the same period.
We also monitor accidents greater than seven lost days in the same way.
Both are internationally recognised standard measures.
Lost time days The total number of lost days attributable to all accidents in the 12 month period.
An internationally recognised standard measure.
Safety improvements As part of our annual Health and Safety Awards Scheme we drive our sites to capture and implement safety improvements.
These are generated by for example employee suggested improvements and investigations into any reported near misses or accidents.
An internationally recognised concept with different businesses measuring and capturing in different ways.
Financial KPIs KPIs selected as either important to our external stakeholders or because they accurately represent an area of management focus often where we are trying to improve historically weaker performance.
RoS% Adjusted operating profit divided by sales.
Adjusted EPS Earnings per share before exceptional or adjusting items.
This is a key metric used by capital markets and stakeholders in assessing performance improvement and value generation in Renold.
Sales per employee Total sales divided by the average number of employees.
A simple way to assess the efficiency of our business processes.
Total overheads Costs that are in theory fixed or very inflexible.
Driving these down is one way to lower our breakeven point and to enhance our operational gearing.
This therefore has a direct impact on our RoS% target.
Up 0.5m Cash cost of servicing legacy pensions Annual cash contributions to closed legacy defined benefit pension schemes including associated administrative costs.
Relatively large sum but adding little or no value to the business.
Hence the goal to keep it stable or reduce.
Average working capital ratio Working capital as a ratio of rolling 12 month sales.
Calculated as the simple average of the previous 12 months.
Based on an average to prevent shorttermism and reflects the need to improve upon historically poor performance.
22.2% Leverage ratio Ratio of Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA.
Banking leverage means the figure reflects our banking agreements which differ from IFRS figures e. agreement.
Historically Renold has a poor record of cash generation and hence this is an area of focus.
Net Debt Total borrowing less cash balances.
Health and safety remains our top priority.
At Renold we make the connection between personal safety and sustainable value creation.
A robust system of control for health and safety is the bedrock of a manufacturing business such as ours.

Challenging market conditions have impacted upon trading performance during the year particularly in our Torque Transmission and Chain Americas businesses.
We have not allowed these challenges to delay or obstruct our strategic progress and continue to take the actions required to position the Group well for when markets recover.
ROBERT PURCELL CHIEF EXECUTIVE AR 2017 Proof 3 STEP 2020 strategy overview A major milestone in our STEP 2020 programme will be the delivery of sustainable midteens margins.
We remain confident that the business can meet this objective and whilst the challenging market environment has as reported slowed the rate of EPS progression over the last two years we are pleased with the overall progress with and benefits of STEP 2020 which is alleviating the impact of reduced levels of demand.
We are putting in place a number of additional selfhelp initiatives to mitigate the ongoing challenging environment and to maintain progress.

Achieve streamlined business t for future Mid teens % margins The market for industrial chain remains highly fragmented across geographies and sector niches.
As we have demonstrated from the successful acquisition of the Gronau based Tooth Chain business selected acquisitions have the potential to deliver incremental shareholder value.
This value derives from consolidating volume into facilities with efcient business processes and efcient manufacturing capability or accessing incremental growth opportunities in new product sectors or new geographies building on the strength in depth of Renolds existing product range and geographic reach.
Renold has the underlying characteristics to make the Group a natural consolidator in the industrial chain market.
As the Number 2 by sales we have the reputation scale and product range to operate as a strong foundation for integration.
Enhanced customer service We believe Renolds reputation for quality and performance is unsurpassed in the market.
However historically our performance in customer service has not lived up to the same standards.
To address this we have implemented strategies to introduce 24 48 and 72 hour response times on a range of standard and congured chains and extended this concept to standard gear and coupling products.
We intend to continue to improve and evolve our offering to enhance the levels of service to our customers whether in standard products or in highlyengineered bespoke solutions.
Product capability We will leverage our existing superior products in Chain and Torque Transmission.
We will also reinvigorate the development and speed to market of a new range of products in both divisions.
We will leverage our product reputation to add value to our customers as we solve their complex power transmission problems.
Renold has strong market shares in certain geographic markets and product categories.
However the fragmented nature of the power transmission market and the extremely diverse enduser markets creates signicant opportunities for organic growth.
Whilst market conditions have proved challenging in recent years the activities to deliver future organic growth have continued.
Improved sales and marketing We will continue to invest in the Groups commercial teams building upon the commercial coverage across Europe the Americas and in Asia.
We will increasingly target specic enduser markets where growth opportunities in our existing product ranges can help to mitigate the cyclicality experienced in our core industrial goods markets.
Through greater levels of direct interaction with our end customers our targeted marketing and communication activities we will help to reinforce our reputation for quality engineering solutions and high performance products.
These actions will position Renold to secure a greater share of the markets in which we operate and to access related markets where we dont currently operate.
Right size cost base Many of our manufacturing processes include manual elements that inevitably reduce any volume benets due to disproportionate increases in costs.
We aim to deliver exible capacity with low marginal costs.
Fix product margins We aim to achieve appropriate value for the highly technical products we offer to the market.
Optimise business processes We aim to deliver support function business processes with the same degree of exibility that we are targeting in our operations.
By implementing simple repeatable and standardised business processes we will lower our breakeven point.
Make the right hires to drive growth We will invest in our people to enable them to match the performance of our enhanced manufacturing and business processes.
In some cases this will involve new talent and ideas being brought into the business.
Restructuring is the area of greatest progress to date since the commencement of the STEP 2020 Strategic Plan in 2013.
Whilst many projects have been successfully implemented numerous opportunities remain to improve efciency and enhance exibility.
Right size capacity Historically the business suffered from excess and inexible capacity.
We aim to signicantly improve in this area by eliminating excess capacity and enhancing the exibility of existing capacity through increased automation.
This will lead to a direct improvement in variable and net margins.

CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW
Our Strategic Objectives and Progress Staircase Overview Progress in 201617 Activities for 201718 and beyond We operate a varied and wide ranging set of business processes which differ in almost all locations.
All of them inter link in different ways with multiple different users and computer systems.
Our aim is to implement one global standard operating model.
This will unify our people processes and systems.
Each of our business processes is being designed to be simple and effective while being robust and as automated as possible.
That will free up management time to focus on value added activities.
It will also reduce the cost and simplify support for our information systems.
Our intention is to create one global integrated ERP system which incorporates efficient and standardised business processes.
We continued on our journey towards this objective during 201617.
Three operating units are now live on the new ERP system including the acquired Tooth Chain business.
This completed the integration into the Renold Group and removed reliance on vendor systems and support.
The implementation of the ERP system is a multiyear project which will continue into FY1718 and beyond.
This programme incorporates elements that go beyond the base ERP system and includes production planning and scheduling engineering and CRM systems.
Our manufacturing facilities have been underinvested over many years.
This has led to inefficient manufacturing processes long lead times excess waste and increased waiting time as products pass between multiple work centres.
Our aim is to modernise our manufacturing capability to match our leading edge engineering and production knowhow.
Better equipped facilities will shorten leadtimes to enhance customer service reduce stock holdings to improve the balance sheet and contribute strongly towards our objective of improving operating margins.
During the year we completed the transfer of our European Distribution Centre from France to Uslar in
This transfer permitted the colocation of the logistics centres for European manufactured product with that imported from our nonEuropean operations.
It also increases capacity at our manufacturing facility in Einbeck through the availability of additional space for manufacturing.
Our manufacturing facility in Malaysia was relocated during the year to larger premises increasing capacity.
Following an employee consultation process we have consolidated our UK Couplings manufacturing facilities into the existing facility in Cardiff.
During the first quarter of 201718 we have relocated our Torque Transmission sales and warehousing functions in China in addition to closing the manufacturing facilities.
The manufacturing activities will now be undertaken in our Torque Transmission facilities in Cardiff Milnrow and South Africa.
We have commenced a major project to relocate our Chain manufacturing operations in China to a new facility being built near Changzhou in Jiangsu province.
The new facility will be a purpose built 21000m factory enhancing our manufacturing capability in China and providing a strong platform for organic growth in the growing domestic Chinese market.
Our staircases provide the groupings for the strategic activities being undertaken within our business units.
Despite the challenging market conditions experienced in a number of our business units in 201617  these challenges have not been allowed to divert our focus from continuing to deliver the strategic actions required to improve the underlying performance of the Group.

20 672017 25753 PM 2529004 AR 2017 Proof 3 Staircase Overview Progress in 201617 Activities for 201718 and beyond Our commercial business processes are focused on improving customer service and enhancing our service offering.
Like many of our diverse business processes there is much scope for us to standardise and simplify.
We are working hard to improve our customer service.
We know we have a long way to go as this is an area that has been weak in the past.
Through improved management of our commercial teams and resources and by reconnecting with customers in their own local markets we aim to make our reputation for service as strong as that for our superior products.
We continued to focus on customer service improvements throughout the year.
In 201516 we introduced 24 48 and 72 hour response times on a range of standard and configured chains.
During 201617 this was extended across a standard range of gear and couplings products.
We continue to review the breadth of these ranges to find the appropriate levels of inventory holdings to provide great customer service whilst not losing sight of our capital efficiency objectives.
Customer service levels have improved particularly on standard products.
We have further work to do in this area particularly in specialist products where we need to ensure the levels of customer service match up to the sector leading quality of our products.
With this in mind we are implementing tailored customer service initiatives across the Group.
Put simply we want to make the best use of the spaces we occupy.
Where we have too much space we will aim to reduce it.
Where we overpay for space we will renegotiate lower rents or move to better priced premises.
Where we have surplus assets or facilities we will aim to realise value and avoid unnecessary costs.
We will over time derisk the Groups balance sheet exposure to legacy defined benefit pension schemes.
At the same time we will maximise the latent value in the Groups recognised and unrecognised tax assets.
During the year we have made good progress in derisking exposure to surplus property or crystallising cash from underutilised assets.
This included the sublease of our closed Bredbury site in the UK and the sale of freehold properties in Mulgrave Australia and Seclin France.
We continue to trade from the property in Mulgrave under a three year lease giving us time to manage the orderly transfer to a smaller more suitable facility.
In the early part of 201718 we have closed our Torque Transmission manufacturing facility in China allowing the move to a smaller office warehousing facility more suitable to the business needs.
In addition following the consolidation of our Halifax Torque Transmission facility into Cardiff we have released a property for sale.
The sale completed in May 2017 generating disposal proceeds of 0.5m.
Our diversity of markets is a major opportunity for the Group.
By bringing greater focus to our sales activities we can deliver steady and sustainable growth and eliminate much of our historical cyclicality.
Our markets typically grow in line with GDP.
Because we are underrepresented in a number of geographies markets and industry sectors we are aiming to deliver annual growth of GDP plus in the period to 2020.
At the same time we will leverage superior product capability to enhance our operating margins and retain value for our shareholders.
Growth is a core element of Phase II of our STEP 2020 Strategic Plan.
Whilst end markets proved to be challenging during the year we continue to lay the foundations to ensure that we are well positioned when end markets recover.
During the year this included strengthening our commercial teams and building sustainable customer relationships from the new sales locations opened in the prior year.
Marketing spend increased by over 50% as we reestablished product support particularly for our distributor customers.
Certain enduser markets are showing early signs of recovery.
Whilst it is too early for us to consider this as sustainable it does reinforce our ambition to establish a strong commercial capability ready to maximise opportunity as markets demonstrate sustainable recovery.

21 672017 25801 PM 2529004 AR 2017 Proof 3 Operating Performance Underlying revenue declined only slightly in the year as increases in the fullyear revenue from the acquired Tooth Chain business helped to offset a small reduction in other underlying Chain revenues and a larger reduction in underlying Torque Transmission revenues.
These revenue reductions largely reflect challenging market conditions experienced by our customers reducing overall demand for Renolds products.
The North American and SouthEast Asian markets were particularly difficult across both Chain and Torque Transmission divisions.
In contrast to this the European Chain operations delivered organic growth to supplement the growth from the acquired Tooth Chain business.
On a reported basis adjusted operating profit increased to 14.5m 2016 14.2m.
However this benefits from the foreign exchange movements in the year.
Underlying adjusted operating profit reduced by 2.3m of which 2.1m occurred in the first half of the year.
Excluding the impact of the acquisition the underlying revenue decline of 6.7m resulted in a 3.3m reduction in underlying adjusted operating profit as the revenue reduction experienced was not matched by a corresponding reduction in nonvariable overhead costs.
This was particularly marked in Torque Transmission but also in the North American and SouthEast Asian Chain operations.
Order intake improved through the year with total orders 1.9% ahead of revenue for the year as a whole.
In the later part of the year there were very early indications of improving conditions in certain enduser markets.
This helped contribute towards the improving underlying book to bill ratio for the second half of the year of 103% and an underlying 9.0% year on year increase in the closing order book at 31 March 2017.
STEP 2020 Strategic Plan Update on progress During the year we have made progress on all three phases of the STEP 2020 Strategic Plan.
Phase I  restructuring Very significant progress has been made during the year to relocate and reposition manufacturing and distribution facilities across the Group.
In the Chain division the European Distribution Centre EDC was relocated during the year and the Malaysian manufacturing facility moved to new larger premises in Kuala Lumpur.
Relocating the EDC from France to Germany close to our main European Chain manufacturing site reduces the costs of handling finished products and improves speed of response and customer service.
It also created the opportunity to sell our premises in Seclin
In Malaysia the decision to move was taken to increase the capacity of the site.
Market conditions have been weak during the year and this permitted the site to relocate with minimum disruption.
As markets recover the site now has a greater potential for future growth.

1723 1233 1466 Generating margin enhancing growth from our superior product capability RoS% 8.5% 8.6% 7.9% Our midteens operating margin target is predicated on GDP levels of organic growth.
Margins and profitability have reduced slightly in the financial year.
Underlying revenue declines in the nonEuropean Chain businesses and the Torque Transmission division have been offset by the acquired Tooth Chain business being included for the full year.
At a margin level the declining underlying revenue results in reduced variable margin.
However the full year impact of acquired margin includes the full year overheads and generates income at a net margin.
The combined effect of these factors is a reduction in RoS% whilst revenue is largely unchanged.
Adjusted EPS 5.0p 4.7p 4.6p ROCE% 15.6% 13.7% 12.6% Enhancing customer service Customer service improvements remain key to supporting future organic growth.
Many of the development programmes that are underway support this objective including the implementation of consistent business processes supported by the ERP rollout investment in new manufacturing equipment and extending the product range covered by our 24 48 and 72 hour response time objectives.
Optimising business processes Sales per employee 79.7k 74.0k 84.0k The process of standardising core business processes continued in the year.
Our new ERP system went live at our Halifax and Gronau sites.
This was a key enabling factor in the consolidation of the UK Couplings sites at Cardiff and Halifax and the removal of reliance on vendor support at the acquired Gronau site.
We have continued to standardise our engineering systems including PLM CAD and CAM packages.
Lowering our breakeven point underlying and pre acquisitions Monthly sales breakeven point 13.5m 12.3m 12.5m On an underlying basis our overheads and monthly sales breakeven point have increased in the year.
However the impact of the volatility in foreign exchange rates in the year had a significant impact.
Adjusting for these factors to aid true likeforlike comparability both overheads and monthly sales breakeven point were largely unchanged in the year.
Ongoing efficiency improvements have continued through the year reducing overheads.
These reductions have been offset by increased revenue investment in the commercial teams and product marketing as we put in place the foundations to deliver on the organic growth phase of the Strategic Plan.
Total overheads Developing our people We continue to make strong progress building the programme which supports the development of our people.
A talent review process has been defined and selectively deployed in the year.

23 672017 25811 PM 2529004 AR 2017 Proof 3 During the year we took advantage of the opportunity to sell the premises at the Mulgrave site in Melbourne Australia.
The site is too large for our ongoing requirements and the leaseback period of three years provides sufficient time to find alternative premises and to relocate in a controlled manner.
Net proceeds of the sale were 9.3m and have reduced net debt at the end of the year to 17.4m 2016 In Torque Transmission the UK Couplings manufacturing facilities were consolidated to a single facility in Cardiff.
Following a period of investment in the Cardiff infrastructure and the commissioning of new equipment all manufacturing was moved from the Halifax site during March 2017.
This creates a single focused UK Couplings manufacturing facility where the volume of production justifies investment in efficient manufacturing equipment that would otherwise be underutilised.
We also commenced the process of closing our Chinese Couplings manufacturing facility in the year final closure completed in May 2017.
The closure removes a small underinvested manufacturing facility from the Group but without loss of revenue as the products can now be manufactured in Cardiff and South Africa.
This reduces cost and avoids future capital investment.
These changes which generally completed in the latter part of the financial year build the platform for more efficient manufacturing and distribution in the future.
Overlaying these infrastructure changes is the programme to optimise business processes.
The most significant element is the implementation of the Groups ERP system across all sites.
This has been successfully implemented at our Cardiff Halifax and Gronau sites and was instrumental in permitting the consolidation of the UK Couplings operations and the removal of reliance on vendor support in the acquired Tooth Chain business.
The process of rollout continues and FY18 will see the rollout progress to further business units including the first of the major Chain manufacturing sites.
Phase II  organic growth Market conditions have limited the amount of organic growth delivered in the period.
However we continue to take action to establish an effective commercial team introduce product development programmes and support our existing brands and customers through focused marketing.
This has included extensive training of our teams distributors and agents along with building sustainable customer relationships though the new Spain Thailand and Indonesia offices opened during 2016.
We have seen early signs of progress in Europe and are replicating these processes and procedures across North America China and South East Asia.
As markets recover we expect to see the benefit of these actions.
During the year we also commenced a programme to relocate our Chain manufacturing facility in China.
This is a significant factory move which will take around 18 months to two years to complete as we are constructing a purpose built facility.
This will be the final step in delivering the Strategic Objective of operating all major manufacturing facilities from owned premises reducing the risk of uncontrolled relocations in the future and providing the basis for long term investment in core manufacturing locations.
When complete this facility will increase capacity and permit greater levels of manufacturing efficiency.
This is critical in targeting growth in the developing domestic Chinese market where product quality is becoming a more important factor in purchasing decisions along with supporting growth in the sale of our Chinesemanufactured chain through overseas markets using the Groups extensive geographic reach.
The overall programme cost is expected to be 16.0m over eight years with 6.0m of construction costs deferred for five to eight years and will be funded from existing Group facilities.

24 672017 25813 PM 2529004 AR 2017 Proof 3 Phase III  acquisitions The programme to integrate the acquired Tooth Chain business into the wider Renold Group completed in the year.
Following the successful rollout of the Groups ERP system we were able to remove all dependence from the vendor for back office and systems support.
Tooth Chain is now a core part of the Groups product offering and the greater strength in depth of Renolds commercial teams across the world provide the potential for further future growth in this product category.
Performance in the period has exceeded original expectations resulting in the payment of the first element of the deferred consideration in April 2017.
This acquisition was the first step in what we believe will be a programme of value adding acquisitions in the future targeting opportunities that generate new product or new geographical opportunities or opportunities to improve manufacturing effectiveness e. through consolidation.
Delivering our Strategic Objectives We continue to make good progress in improving our health and safety performance.
Fewer accidents and a greater focus on identifying and reducing risk in order to avoid accidents is indicative of the progress being made and the behavioural change that we are seeking across the Groups global operations.
Our objective of delivering growth in operating profit margins has been impacted by shortterm trading conditions in the year.
However a number of other KPI measures provide evidence that continued progress on restructuring will deliver improvement in operating profit margins when market conditions improve.
Average employee numbers during the year have reduced by 2.2% improving sales per employee to 84.0k 2016 74.0k 2016 underlying This reduction derives from the restructuring activities delivered combining with a general focus on business efficiency.
The underlying breakeven revenue adjusted for acquisitions has remained relatively unchanged in the year at 12.5m per month.
This reflects an underlying decrease following the restructuring elements of the Strategic Plan but offset by additional overheads for marketing product management and commercial support which have been added to support the organic growth activities.
Developing our people remains a core part of improving the future prospects of the Group and we have made progress across all levels of the businesses.
A number of new senior managers have been recruited in the year adding to the wider leadership team including a Managing Director for the consolidated UK Couplings business a General Manager for the Chain Europe manufacturing facility in Einbeck Germany and a Regional MD for our SouthEast Asian businesses with the objective of increasing our presence in these growing markets.
We also continued with our Future Leaders programme welcoming six new graduates.
Macroeconomic landscape and Brexit There are a number of wellpublicised macroeconomic risks on the horizon.
We continue to deliver our strategy cognisant of the risks but similarly very aware that the impact of these risks is uncertain and should not delay our progress.
The vote for Brexit had a significant impact on the value of Sterling and the foreign exchange movements have impacted our reported trading position.
However this is largely a presentational issue as our results are reported in Sterling.
Our
8% of the Groups revenue whilst we retain manufacturing facilities that supply product to our other global operations.
These products have become more competitive in overseas markets as a result of the currency movements.
There are certain product categories which we import to the UK particularly chain manufactured in our European facilities.
Whilst this has become more expensive as a result of the foreign exchange movements the majority of competitor products are sourced from Europe and the FarEast and are exposed to similar inflationary pressure.
Overall we do not believe that Brexit significantly impacts on our competitive positioning.
The major risk factor to the Group from Brexit other Eurozone and US macroeconomic risks is the impact on the timing of recovery of industrial production in general.
We will continue to monitor this and take action as required.
Outlook
We have delivered a robust performance in challenging markets.
The impact of the market headwinds on revenue and operating profit would have been far greater had it not been for the actions delivered to increase operating efficiencies as part of our STEP 2020 strategy.
Markets stabilised during the year and there was a return to revenue growth in the second half of the year along with an increase in order intake.
Although there are some early indications of improvement macroeconomic uncertainty remains and in turbulent times our STEP 2020 Strategic Plan remains relevant and critical to the long term delivery of value to all of our stakeholders.
Actions already delivered as part of the plan will combine with ongoing programmes to further improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations.
The
Group is positioned for organic growth and we continue to believe that midteens operating margins and sustainable gains in adjusted earnings per share can be delivered when volumes improve through organic growth and acquisitions.

Renold Chain is a global market leading supplier of differentiated and value added chain products for a wide variety of markets and a myriad of end use applications.
We create innovative solutions for our customers who need to ensure performance within increasingly challenging working environments.
The Renold name is known for industry leading design and specification high quality and exceptional service and technical support.
Reducing overall cost of ownership is important to our customers with extended product life and reduced maintenance key factors in specifying our products.
Chain performance review Underlying revenue of 146.1m was 3.1m 2.2% ahead of the prior year.
Underlying external revenues excluding acquisitions were 2.3m 1.6% behind prior year reflecting a backdrop of difficult macroeconomic conditions in many of the territories in which we operate.
However regional performance was mixed and there were some encouraging performances particularly in Europe Australia and India.
Underlying European revenue increased by 8.3m 16.3% in the period 2.9m 5.9% excluding acquisitions with organic growth delivered in most of our major European markets in addition to growth from the full year impact of the acquisition of the Tooth Chain business.
Revenue in the Americas finished 4.4m 7.3% down on an underlying basis with continued soft demand in the US from major distributors and larger OEM accounts.
Disappointingly this was compounded by production issues during the final quarter of the year as orders started to recover.
These issues are shortterm in nature and are being resolved.
After a slow start our Canadian business recovered in the second half to deliver underlying year on year growth of 3.4%.
Domestic sales in India and China grew by 0.5m 7.9% and 0.4m 12.0% respectively.
However the overall performance of both businesses was depressed by lower demand in export markets.
Underlying revenue in Australasia was down by 0.8m 3.9% primarily due to continued weakness in palm oil markets in SouthEast Asia being partially offset by growth in Australia of 4.9% where sales to the mining and agriculture sectors started to recover.
Order intake of 149.2m was up by 11.4m 8.2% on the previous year.
At a regional level European underlying order intake was up by 10.7m 21.1% against a decline of 0.5m 0.9% in the Americas.
Order intake in Australasia was down 0.1m 0.4% but up in India and China by 6.8% and 19.3% respectively.
Order intake accelerated in the second half of the year with growth of 11.9% compared to growth of 4.6% in the first half of the year as enduser markets started to demonstrate signs of recovery.
Orders
Contribution margins the margin after all variable production costs remained flat.
This was achieved despite increases in raw material costs in the second half of the year and reflects the continued focus on cost reductions improved product quality and enriched business mix.
Overheads increased year on year with the addition of the Tooth Chain business continued upgrading of talent and investments in marketing and sales development programmes.
Underlying adjusted operating profit finished at 16.6m compared to 17.8m last year.
Return on sales of 11.4% 2016 12.4% was particularly impacted by the disappointing performance in the US during the year.
Renold Tooth Chain acquired in January 2016 continues to trade ahead of expectations delivering underlying organic growth in both orders and sales against the last comparable period under prior ownership.
The business has been fully rebranded and customers transferred into the Renold commercial network with no business loss.
In December the final part of the integration process the transfer onto the new Group ERP system was successfully completed and Tooth Chain is now well positioned for further development in the global commercial and distribution footprint as part of the Renold
Commercial talent continues to be steadily upgraded in all regions and the team has been further strengthened with senior commercial resource added in the US Australia and India.
A new Managing Director for the businesses in SouthEast Asia has also been appointed for the first time bringing a single point of focus to our activities within that important growth region.
Service improvements remain key A key element of the growth strategy continues to centre on improvements to our operational effectiveness and customer service.
A number of initiatives have been successfully completed during the year which will enable increased production output shorter lead times better inventory efficiency and improved levels of customer service.
The largest single investment in new productive capability the rotary machining centre 2.5m was successfully commissioned in February and is already boosting output in the US facility.
This machine dramatically reduces production lead times on complex components whilst at the same time improving quality and removing up to ten separate manufacturing operations.
Machine investments in other regions were similarly targeted on harnessing the latest technology in order to boost productive capacity and reduce lead times.
During the year the European distribution centre was relocated from France to be close to the main manufacturing facility in Einbeck Germany.
The prime drivers behind this move were to reduce lead times improve stock efficiency and enhance Renold plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 for the year ended 31 March 2017 Renold AR2017Proof3.

The project was successfully delivered during November and also resulted in reduced headcount and the sale of the previous distribution centre in Seclin France resulting in proceeds from the sale of 0.9m.
The Malaysian factory was successfully relocated during December.
The new facility will allow up to four times more productive capability whilst enabling inventory management to be improved and response times reduced.
It is also an enabler for the introduction of a rapid response cell for customised transmission chains following a similar addition in China during this year.
Last year we highlighted the successful introduction of strategic inventory on core product lines.
This has been enhanced and developed during the year in support of our service commitment for 24 48 and 72 hour response times on standard and configured chains.
Where appropriate targeted holdings of components have also been introduced in order to facilitate the rapid assembly of product variants within particular chain product families.
This has been achieved with a marginal increase in net inventories As we head into the new financial year we have commenced the next significant phase in our manufacturing strategy.
Using the end of the building lease of our existing Chinese factory as the trigger point for change we have commenced a programme to relocate the business to a purposebuilt facility near Changzhou in Jiangsu province.
This strategy incorporates twin objectives of providing a platform for organic growth in the domestic Chinese market along with developing a leading manufacturing facility which can effectively supply Renolds distribution infrastructure with certain standard product ranges.
Summary
Market headwinds impacted upon trading performance during the second half of 201516 and during 201617.
However sustained investment in marketing and the commercial teams has driven organic growth in Europe during the latter part of 201617.
Growing order intake arising as market conditions improve resulted in strengthened order books at 31 March 2017.
This improving economic backdrop along with the benefits of the selfhelp actions delivered over the last year give us reason for optimism in 201718.
In the longer term we remain confident that the continued progress of the STEP 2020 Strategic Plan will deliver sustainable improvement in the divisions operating margins.

27 672017 25824 PM Renold Synergy chain has long been known for industrial applications where its ability to outperform its closest competitors has seen it leading the market.
What is less well known is that the same cuttingedge chain technology platform on which Synergy was built has been helping the Great Britain Cycling team to achieve world and Olympic success RENOLD ENABLES PEAK PERFORMANCE AR 2017 Proof 3 OUR PERFORMANCE
How it all started Way back in 1880 when the few cyclists on the roads were more than likely riding high on a Penny Farthing young engineer Hans Renold achieved a significant technical breakthrough when he invented the bush roller chain.
This innovative chain technology solved many problems inherent in existing solutions and brought a new level of performance efficiency and flexibility to the transmission of mechanical power.
Renolds fledgling business grew steadily providing power transmission chains to the industrial applications of the day.
What this new technology really needed however was a mass market application.
Enter John Kemp Starley who in 1885 brought to market his safety bicycle.
The
Rover bicycle included many ground breaking features including the use of chain to drive the rear wheel.
This synergy of technology and application proved a perfect match and resulted in the rapid growth of both bicycle and roller chain industries.
Pedal forward 130 years and the bicycle has been transformed  stronger lighter and capable of incredible performance.
In the chain world Renold has built a global business serving a huge array of industries and applications.
Following the example of its founder Renold has dedicated itself to the relentless pursuit of better chain technologies  stronger highly durable and extremely efficient.

SKILLS and
SERVICE LOGISTICS Renold chain technology  a critical link In 2011 British Cycling were looking for a drive chain that could meet the incredible demands of elite level competition both in the Velodrome and on the BMX track.
After some discussion between British Cyclings RandD Team and Renold Engineers it was felt that the requirements could be met using Renolds Synergy chain technology platform.
Following a great deal of collaborative work between British Cycling and Renold Chains along with the University of Bristol Renold engineers were able to optimise their pre existing chain design which culminated in the chain that was used to great effect by the Great Britain Track Cycling team in both the London and Rio Olympic Games.
Speaking about the relationship Matt Taylor  Managing Director of Renolds Chain division said Renold are immensely proud to have played a part in the outstanding success of British Cycling and the Great Britain Cycling Team.
Likewise Tony Purnell from British Cyclings RandD Team said that As part of British Cyclings no stone unturned philosophy it was obvious that chain design was an area of interest and we have been impressed by the undoubted expertise and obvious willingness of Renold to work with us on this project.

29 672017 25832 PM 2529004 AR 2017 Proof 3 OUR PERFORMANCE T orque Transmission Renold Torque Transmission is an international manufacturer of high integrity torque transmitting products used where public safety or assured plant operation is critical.
Renolds products are integral but generally unseen in different facets of daily life from gearboxes driving heavy duty high rise escalators in London and New York subway systems to shaft couplings in cement plants ensuring the uninterrupted production of a vital building material.
Torque Transmission performance Underlying external revenue of 37.3m was 4.4m 10.6% below the prior year primarily reflecting the annualised effect of the market headwinds that were initially experienced during the second half of 201516.
These headwinds were reduced demand particularly in the Americas region in the oil and gas raw material extraction and steel industries.
This annualising effect impacted upon the first half of 201617 and saw revenues decline by 22.6% when compared with the same period in the prior year.
During the second half of the year underlying external revenue of 19.5m was 0.8m 4.3% ahead of the prior year benefiting from large orders for escalator drives in the London and New York undergrounds.
Underlying order intake was 3.0m 7.4% below the prior year.
Order intake was 9.6% ahead of revenue in the first half of 201617.
Due to the longer lead times in the Torque Transmission division these orders during the first half of the year delivered revenue growth during the second half of the year.
Order intake for the second half of the year was 7.7% below revenue for the same period.
Contribution margins the margin after all variable production costs improved by 3 percentage points during the year with exchange rate movements benefiting margins for UK manufactured products although this was largely offset by direct labour costs not reducing in line with the revenue.
Underlying net overheads in the division decreased.
The savings arising from the selfhelp measures implemented have been reinvested in commercial activities including expansion of the sales force in order to target nontraditional enduser sectors.
Underlying adjusted operating profit finished at 3.9m a decrease of 1.3m from the prior year with a decrease of 2.8m for the first half of the year offset by a recovery of 1.5m for the second half of the year.
The divisions Return on Sales fell from 12.5% to 10.5% largely reflecting the revenue decline in the period.
As with revenue and adjusted operating profit the performance in the second half of the year improved when compared to the first.
Return on Sales for the first half of 201617 was 6.7% increasing to 13.8% for the second half.
Strategic actions When the STEP 2020 Strategic Plan was originally implemented the initial actions focused on the Chain division as this was significantly underperforming.
At the time the Torque Transmission division delivered strong margins.
However the decline in revenue experienced during 201516 and 201617 impacted significantly upon profitability as the protective actions were not sufficiently developed to mitigate the margin impact.
Following the CEO taking direct daytoday responsibility for the division acting as Divisional Managing Director greater focus has been given to the elements of the STEP 2020 Strategic Plan which impact on the Torque Transmission division and a number of actions were delivered during the year.
As part of Phase I  Restructuring the coupling manufacturing locations in the UK Halifax and Cardiff were consolidated into the Cardiff facility.
This process completed in April 2017 but was the culmination of a number of project streams that upgraded the ERP systems of the businesses to the same platform invested in capital equipment to increase capacity and trained the teams to ensure manufacturing know how was transferred.
The oneoff cost of the transfer was 2.9m see Note 2c and benefits are expected to be realised during the next financial year.

Again the oneoff costs of transfer were incurred in 201617 see Note 2c with the benefits expected to be realised in 201718.
As part of Phase II  Organic Growth the division has reestablished its focus on new product development product marketing and commercial capability.
This along with a reinvigorated focus on customer service is expected to deliver growth particularly in nontraditional sectors.
Summary
The division has a strong portfolio of niche products and a reputation in the market for product performance and quality.
Market conditions have stabilised during the year and whilst we are not yet seeing demand recover to historical levels the selfhelp actions delivered during the year are capable of improving the performance of the division in the absence of market recovery.
As market conditions improve over the medium term the division will be better placed to maximise returns.

Giant screwdown worm gears were designed and manufactured for a leading manufacturer of steel plate to drive two large rollers for rolling steel slabs to the required plate thickness on a quarto reversing mill.
The steel slabs could initially be up to 300mm thick and are rolled precisely to reduce thickness and produce steel plate to customers exact specifications.
During the rolling process the worm gears auto adjust by sliding on a special spline incorporated in the worm wheel hub.
The giant screwdown worm gears have a centre distance of over 32 inches and a ratio of 361.
The worm shaft is nearly two metres long and together with the wheel they weigh in at a colossal 4850 kilograms or nearly five tonnes the approximate weight of three average sized family cars The original manufacturer of the mill press was no longer in business and the steel company was finding it impossible to obtain spares.
A breakdown would have halted production and so Renold Gears was approached because of its unique ability to manufacture large worm gear sets of this size and specification.
As only minimal technical drawings were available of the mill it was necessary to reverse engineer the old worm gears to accurately and precisely reproduce the original design specifications.
The steel company is a leading supplier of steel plate and produces around 200000 tonnes annually for a wide range of uses including buildings bridges yellow goods industrial machinery wind turbines and general construction.

Whilst operating margins have reduced in the year this is largely due to market conditions.
The self help actions delivered in the year provide the basis for a stronger recovery when market conditions improve.
IAN SCAPENS FINANCE DIRECTOR
Challenging market conditions first experienced in the second half of the prior year continued into the year under review resulting in reduced revenue and profit in the first half.
Relative performance improved through the year as trading in Torque Transmission stabilised and organic growth in Chain Europe was delivered.
This helped to recover some of the declines from the first half.
Positive indications from order intake during the latter part of the year suggest some early signs of improving endcustomer markets as we move into the new financial period.

All
Chain regions had book to bill ratios greater than 100% for the year.
Underlying order intake demonstrated good progress in the year with growth in the second half of 11.9% over the second half of the prior year.
This compared to growth of 4.6% for the first half and together resulted in growth for the full year of 8.2%.
In Torque Transmission the weaker demand from commodity related and capital goods markets experienced in the second half of the prior year continued into the first half of the current year.
Underlying order intake in the first half of the year declined by 13.4% when compared to the same period in the prior year.
Whilst underlying order intake in the second half of the year grew by 0.2% this is growth over the weaker second half of the previous year.
The book to bill ratio for the division was 100.8% 2016 97.4%.
Group revenue for the year increased by 18.2m 11.0% to 183.4m benefiting from foreign exchange tailwinds and continued strong performance of the Tooth Chain business acquired in December 2015.
Underlying revenue for the year was broadly unchanged with the small decline of 1.3m representing a 0.7% reduction.
This includes the fullyear benefit of the Tooth Chain acquisition.
Excluding the effect of this acquisition underlying revenue declined by 6.7m 3.6%.
The reduction in underlying revenue was concentrated in the first half of the year with a yearonyear decline of 4.0% reflecting a continuation of the weak Renold plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 for the year ended 31 March 2017 Renold AR2017Proof3.
34 672017 25916 PM 2529004 AR 2017 Proof 3 endcustomer markets experienced in the second half of the prior year.
The Group returned to growth for the second half of the year with revenue 2.8% ahead.
On a divisional basis the Chain division saw underlying revenue increase by 2.1% with Torque Transmission weaker 10.5% down.
Operating profit The Group generated 7.0m of adjusted operating profit in the first half 2016 7.9m 7.5m in the second half 2016 6.3m and a full year result of 14.5m 2016 14.2m.
At the halfyear we reported underlying adjusted operating profit down by 2.0m which increased to 2.1m incorporating the mix effect of changing foreign exchange rates to March 2017.
This shortfall significantly reduced during the second half of the year with underlying adjusted operating profit down by 0.2m resulting in a full year shortfall of 2.3m.
Underlying adjusted operating margins fell during the year to 7.9% 2016 9.1%.
The Tooth Chain acquisition generated underlying revenue growth of 5.4m delivering an incremental underlying adjusted operating profit of 1.6m.
Excluding the impact of the acquisition underlying revenue declined by 6.7m with a corresponding reduction in underlying adjusted operating profit of 3.3m.
The combined effect of these elements is a small reduction to revenue with a reduction to the operating margin delivered in the year.
Although not readily transparent from the consolidated Group results we continue to remain focused on improving the overhead efficiency of the Group.
The monthly breakeven revenue has increased to 12.8m 2016 11.3m 12.4m on an underlying basis.
The Tooth Chain acquisition introduces a monthly revenue requirement of 0.3m to breakeven.
On an underlying basis excluding the acquisition the monthly breakeven revenue has increased by 0.2m 1.6%.
This reflects the fact that we are spending more on marketing and commercial headcount in order to support the organic growth phase of the STEP 2020 Strategic Plan.
Foreign exchange rates Foreign exchange rates have been extremely volatile during the year reflecting the decline in the value of Sterling following the UKs Brexit vote in June 2016.
The value of Sterling fell significantly in June with an impact on the weighted average exchange rates used to convert the Groups results to Sterling in the first half.
This fall was largely sustained throughout the second half of the year compounding the impact on the weighted average rates.
The natural hedge normally provided by the Groups diverse operating territories and currencies therefore did not operate in the year as Sterling weakened against almost all global currencies at the same time.

Gross charges of 4.6m 2016 3.4m related to various restructuring and redundancy costs incurred as part of STEP 2020 4.3m or costs of integrating the Tooth Chain acquisition 0.3m.
The more significant restructuring and redundancy costs were incurred in consolidating the UK Couplings manufacturing to Cardiff relocating the European distribution facility to Uslar Germany and commencing the programme to relocate our Chain China manufacturing facility to a new purpose built facility.
Offsetting these gross exceptional costs is a net gain of 2.9m made on the sale and shortterm leaseback of the Mulgrave manufacturing facility in Australia.
For more details please see Note 2c.
Other adjusting items Other adjusting items include legacy pension scheme administration costs of 0.7m 2016 0.7m and amortisation of acquired intangible assets of 1.1m 2016 Financing costs External net interest costs in the year were 1.7m 2016 1.5m.
The annual charge includes 0.2m 2016 0.2m charge in respect of amortisation of the residual refinancing costs paid in 2012 and 2015.
Financing costs also include 0.1m of unwinding discounts on onerous lease provisions established for the Bredbury factory site.
Certain elements of the Groups debt facilities are drawn in nonsterling currencies and the foreign exchange factors which impact upon revenue and operating profit also impact upon financing costs.
The movement in foreign exchange rates in the year have the effect of increasing the external net interest cost by 0.1m in the year.
The net IAS 19 finance charge which is a noncash item is 2.5m 2016 2.0m.
In the current year the actual return on assets was 11.3m higher than the return used in the interest calculation as specified in IAS 19 due primarily to stronger equity markets and the offsetting impact of higher corporate bond yields on the value of corporate bond portfolios.
The difference appears as a remeasurement gain in the asset section of Note 18.
Result before tax Profit before tax was 6.7m 2016 7.4m.
Adjusted profit before tax which excludes exceptional items IAS 19 financing costs amortisation of acquired intangible assets and legacy pension scheme costs was 12.8m 2016 12.7m.
Taxation
The current year tax charge of 1.9m 2016 charge of 2.0m is made up of a current tax charge of 2.9m 2016 charge of 1.5m and a deferred tax credit of 1.0m 2016 charge of 0.5m.
The Group cash tax paid was much lower at 1.0m 2016 1.0m.
The difference between tax charges and cash tax paid is due to the utilisation of tax losses and other tax assets in various parts of the Group.
The last of our historical tax losses in Germany were utilised in the year.
The effect of this will be to increase tax payments in future years in this profitable territory with a double impact in the year ended 31 March 2018 as payments on account become more significant.
Group results for the financial period Profit for the financial year ended 31 March 2017 was 4.8m 2016 5.4m.
The basic and diluted adjusted earnings per share were both 4.6p 2016 earnings of 4.7p and 4.6p respectively.

36 672017 25936 PM 2529004 AR 2017 Proof 3 Balance sheet Net assets at 31 March 2017 were 7.8m 2016 10.5m.
The fall was driven by the increase in the net pension deficit as lower discount rates and increasing inflation rates result in increased liabilities.
This has only been partially offset by outperformance of asset returns in the period.
The net liability for pension benefit obligations was 84.8m 2016 68.1m after allowing for a net deferred tax asset of 17.2m 2016 14.8m.
Overseas schemes now account for 25.0m 29.0% of the post tax pension deficits and 26.2m of this is in respect of the German scheme which is not required to be prefunded.
Cash flow and borrowings Cash generated from operations was 7.4m 2016 10.8m.
Gross capital expenditure was up in the year at 9.6m 2016 9.5m.
This investment was partially funded through the disposal proceeds from the sale of properties in the year of 10.2m 2016 nil.
Capital expenditure in the new financial year is expected to exceed 13.0m.
A number of major projects totalling approximately 7.8m are already committed as at the date of this report including 6.0m for the relocation of our Chinese Chain manufacturing facility and 1.2m in respect of the roll out of our global IT system.
Investments were also made in a number of stock lines to support new sales initiatives and new product launches.
This in part explains the small rise in our working capital KPI average working capital as a ratio of rolling 12 month sales from 20.3% to 22.2% which was also adversely impacted by the slow down in demand.
The absolute level of working capital was 3.4m higher than in the prior year.
Group net borrowings at 31 March 2017 of 17.4m were 6.1m lower than the opening position of 23.5m comprising cash and cash equivalents of 16.4m 2016 13.5m and borrowings of 33.8m 2016 37.0m.
The decrease in net debt is almost wholly explained by the proceeds received for the sale of properties in the year.
Debt facility and capital structure The Groups core banking facilities are unchanged in the year and remain a committed 41.0m MultiCurrency Revolving Credit Facility MCRF with a 20.0m accordion.
The facility matures in May 2020.
The Group continues to operate comfortably within covenant limits.
The Net DebtAdjusted EBITDA ratio as at 31 March 2017 is 0.82 times covenant requirement 2.5 times 2016 1.1 times based on the reported figures for the period as adjusted for the banking agreement.
The Adjusted EBITDAinterest cover as at 31 March 2017 is 12.1 times covenant requirement 4.0 times 2016 13.6 times again on a banking basis.

The largest element of the increase relates to the UK scheme where the deficit increased from 53.6m to 72.0m.
The increase in the deficit of the overseas schemes of 0.7m arises from an underlying reduction in the deficit of 1.9m offset by a 2.6m increase arising from foreign exchange movements in the year.
UK funded scheme The major reason for the increase in the deficit of the UK funded scheme is the impact of the actuarial assumptions on the value of liabilities.
Reductions to discount rates have combined with increasing inflation assumptions to increase the value of liabilities by 35.8m.
However this increase was offset by experience gains the difference between assumptions previously made and experience of real events and asset returns delivered above assumed levels which together generated gains of 15.3m to offset the deficit increase.
Overseas funded schemes The overseas funded schemes comprise a number of smaller schemes around the world.
Deficits on these schemes reduced in the year by 1.0m despite a 0.7m increase in net liability due to the movement in foreign exchange rates.
Experience gains asset outperformance and contributions to the schemes combined to reduce the underlying deficits in aggregate by 1.7m.
Overseas unfunded schemes This category largely relates to the unfunded German schemes.
The deficit increased in the year as foreign exchange movements increased the liability by The underlying deficit reduced by 0.2m as increases arising from actuarial assumptions were offset by payments of benefits in the year.
The aggregate expense of administering the pension schemes was 0.7m 2016 0.7m and is included in operating costs but is excluded in arriving at adjusted operating profit.
The latest triennial actuarial valuation of the UK Scheme with an effective date of 5 April 2016 was recently agreed.
This process concluded that contributions to the UK Scheme should continue unchanged and no additional contributions in excess of the previously agreed asset backed funding structure were deemed necessary.
The next triennial valuation date will be 5 April 2019.
The detailed structure and mechanics of the merger and underpinning asset backed funding structure are set out in Note 18 to the accounts.
Total cash costs for UK deficit repair payments and UK administrative expenses in the period were 3.9m 2016 3.4m which includes 0.7m 2016 0.7m in administration costs.
The increase in UK deficit repair payments in the year of 0.5m reflects a oneoff additional contribution as part of the medically underwritten buyins which completed in the prior year.
Total cash costs for the overseas pension schemes increased in the period to 2.1m 2016 1.9m as a result of foreign exchange differences.

They are held primarily to generate an income stream that supports the ongoing annual pension payments currently circa 9.5m including cash lump sums on retirement.
The overall target for UK portfolio returns is 5.5%.
The actual UK return in the year was a gain of 15.3m or 11.1% gain.
It should be noted that the diversified growth funds have characteristics of both protection assets returns are lower and less volatile than equities and growth assets return targets are higher than simple gilts and bonds.
The chart to the left shows a comparison between expected and actual mortality in the UK scheme based on the assumptions underlying the March 2017 Annual Report and the actual mortality experience.
The chart also shows the number of life years that could be expected to die each year referred to as Exposure.
The fall in Exposure over the years has largely been driven by the significant falls in membership numbers resulting from the scheme merger and various small pots exercises as well as mortality itself and the age of the membership.
The chart clearly shows that even based on the current strong mortality assumptions actual deaths have been higher than expected levels.

The step change in 2014 followed the merger of the three UK schemes when 1316 members had their benefits paid out in full in wind up lump sums.
A small pots exercise completed in 2016 and 207 members had their benefits paid out in full.

FX and Other The net pension deficit increased by 23% in the year to 102.0m.
Liability assumptions for discount rates and inflation in the UK scheme were the largest cause of deficit increase combining to increase the UK liabilities by 35.9m.
UK discount rates fell sharply in the early part of the year resulting in a significant increase in the UK deficit at 30 September 2016.
UK discount rates increased in the second half of the year but the expected reduction in liabilities did not crystalise as increases in UK inflation rates had an offsetting effect.
UK asset performance was strong in the year reducing the deficit by 10.7m with a further 0.6m delivered on overseas schemes.
The movement in the deficit arising on overseas schemes was small as a reduction in the deficit was largely offset by foreign exchange movements.

The Board has overall responsibility and oversight of the risk management framework and is also responsible for setting the parameters of acceptable and unacceptable risk referred to as risk appetite.
Renolds risk appetite The Board acknowledges that the Group is exposed to risk during the normal course of business.
Renold must be willing to accept an appropriate level of risk in order to achieve its Strategic Objectives.
The
Boards attitude to risk management and its appetite for risk can be described as tending to risk averse.
Our risk management process The Executive Risk Management and Monitoring Committee The Group Audit Committee reviews the principal risks and uncertainties together with the actions taken and relevant mitigating controls.

Senior members of the business attend by invitation and are required to present risk profiles for their functional areas and the aligned action plans to manage or mitigate risk.
The Group Business Systems Director the Group HR Director the Group Head of Risk and Assurance and the Group Legal Manager and Company Secretary also attend each meeting.
Each ERMMC meeting is informed by a detailed risk management status report.
This report provides an insight on new risks and progress on mitigating actions on all risks.
Other topical risk issues also feature on the standing agenda e. events.
The ERMMC is also provided with information in the form of reports on health and safety treasury insurance material litigation and whistle blowing.

Risk workshops involving local and functional staff are used to develop risk profiles and action plans.
The Group Head of Risk and Assurance facilitates the end to end risk management process ensuring consistency of approach and compliance with Group Policy.
Risks are assessed against the framework defined in the Group Risk Management
Our risk assessment model considers The probability of a risk crystallising.
The potential impact if the risk crystallised  impact definitions cover a range of criteria including direct financial impact reputational impact people impact e. movement of the share price.
These are scored and then placed on the risk heat map above which is a matrix of probability and impact and shows our principal risks and uncertainties.
Our model also considers each risk from two different perspectives The extent of inherent risk i. any mitigating controls or actions.
The extent of residual risk i. mitigating controls and actions.
This allows us to assess the positive impact of control on the underlying inherent risk.
The Group has deployed an online
Integrated Risk Management System
IRMS across all locations.
This is used to capture risk profiles and actions under management.
Action plans are maintained across the Group with all system updates subject to review by the Group Head of Risk.
How we manage risk Having identified the risks the business faces and having scored them against the Risk Appetite set by the Board our Group Policy then provides guidance on how to manage those risks depending on where they sit on the risk heat map.
The heat map shows the four bandings in the different shades of risks as set out below as well as expected actions and responses to risks in these areas Green within appetite.

The Executive Risk Management
Set out on pages 42 to 46 are the principal risks and uncertainties which could have a material impact on the Group.
The numbers correspond to the risk identified on the heat map.
These risks are continually monitored.
The Board has critically reassessed the risks we face in light of the Groups progress on its STEP 2020 Strategic Plan coupled with the volatility in our end markets.
We indicate whether or not we consider the probability or impact of the risks materialising are increasing decreasing or unchanged and set out the corresponding mitigating actions that have been taken by the Group.
We also show which of our Strategic Objectives could be impacted by the risk.
Strategy Execution Detailed risk The Groups strategy requires the coordinated delivery of a number of complex projects e. production facilities.
LINK TO STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES Potential impact Whilst these projects are designed to deliver targeted benefits if not appropriately managed they have the potential to negatively impact the Groups operations.
Existing mitigation controls The STEP 2020 Strategic Plan has been developed to deliver a turnaround in performance and to make that performance more stable and less exposed to revenue volatility.
The Board reviews progress against the different STEP 2020 projects in each of its meetings.
This is based on a regularly updated report from the CEO which groups the individual projects into themes linked directly to our Strategic Objectives.
Major projects are all managed in accordance with best practice project management techniques with at least one member of the Executive team on the relevant Steering Committees.
Macroeconomic and Political Volatility Detailed risk Material changes in prevailing macroeconomic or political conditions could have a detrimental impact on business performance.
We operate in 19 countries and sell to customers in over 100 and therefore we are necessarily exposed to economic and political risks in these territories.
LINK TO STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES Potential impact Potential touchpoints include Commodity prices which have a negative impact on demand in the whole supply chain.
Foreign exchange volatility can impact customer buying patterns leading to lower demand or the need to rapidly switch supply chains.
The political issues affecting the UK and Europe are also impacting business performance and confidence.
Existing mitigation controls Our diversified geographic footprint inherently exposes us to more countries where risks arise but conversely provides some degree of resilience.
Actions to lower the Groups overall breakeven point also serve to reduce the impact of any global economic slowdown.
A focus on predict and respond e. sales forecasting and raw material price monitoring.

Low impact Trend Direction AR 2017 Proof 3 AcquisitionsBusiness Development Detailed risk Part of the Groups strategy is to grow through selective acquisitions.
Performance of acquired businesses may not reach expectations impacting Group profitability and cash flows.
LINK TO STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES Potential impact Any acquisition involves risks at various stages of the project life cycle.
During the Acquisitions phase value can be lost through overpaying missing key issues in due diligence or potential value leakage through poor contract negotiation.
Value can also be lost through a poorly planned or executed integration phase.
Finally failure to deliver anticipated benefits during the business as usual phase can also lead to a loss of value.
Existing mitigation controls Monitoring of specific acquisition targets Business Acquisition Process incorporating Concept Evaluation Business Case Indicative Offer Heads of Terms Due Diligence covering a range of criteria Integration Planning and Execution and Post Integration Appraisal which in turn feeds back to the Business Acquisition Process.
Use of third party specialists to address risks specific to each acquisition.
Formation of topdown cross functional business integration project teams and plans.
These specifically address any issues or risks identified during the Acquisitions phase.
Deployment of detailed benefits realisation plans.
Health and Safety in the Workplace Detailed risk The risk of death or serious injury to employees or third parties associated with Renolds worldwide operations.
We are proud of the progress we have made in recent years but recognise that we have more to do.
LINK TO STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES Potential impact Accidents caused by a lack of robust safety procedures could result in life changing impacts for employees visitors or contractors.
This will always be unacceptable.
In addition accidents could result in civil or criminal liability for both the Group and the Directors and officers of the Group and Group companies leading to reputational damage.
Existing mitigation controls Group policies and a Groupwide management system known as the Framework to set control expectations with a support training programme for all managers.
The Group operates a rolling programme of Internal Audits to assess compliance against the Framework.
Continual hazard assessments to ensure awareness of risks.
Live tracking of accident rates and root cause analysis via the IRMS plus monthly Board reporting focused on a range of KPIs.

The Group continues to implement a global ERP system to replace numerous legacy systems which inherently brings with it the risks associated with a large scale change programme.
LINK TO STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES Potential impact Interruption or failure of IT systems including the impact of a cyber attack would negatively impact or indeed prevent some business activities from occurring.
If the interruption was long lasting significant damage could be done to the business.
It is essential that we are able to rely on the data derived from our business system to feed routine but fundamental business performance monitoring.
An unsuccessful implementation of the global ERP system has the potential to materially impact that sites and possibly the Groups performance.
The risk is assessed as stable as we have already successfully implemented the ERP at two locations.
Existing mitigation controls Shortterm stabilisation of existing hardware and legacy software platforms.
Governance and control arrangement operating over the Groups ERP implementation programme.
Use of specialist external consultants and recruitment of experienced personnel.
Phased implementation rather than big bang.
Project assurance and lessons learned reviews to continuously improve the quality of successive roll outs.
Template blueprint agreed to form the basis of the implementations.
Steering Committee in operation with cascading project management disciplines.
A range of preventative and detective controls to manage the risk of a cyber attack.
Prolonged Loss of a Manufacturing Site Detailed risk A catastrophic loss of the use of all or a significant portion of a strategic production facility.
This could result from an accident a strike by employees fire severe weather or other cause outside of management control.
LINK TO STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES Potential impact In the short or longterm a related risk event could adversely affect the Groups ability to meet the demands of its customers.
Specifically this could entail significant repair costs or costs of alternate supply while repairs are made.
A significant proportion of the Groups revenue is on relatively short lead times and a break in our supply chain could result in loss of revenue.
All of this translates into lower sales and profits.
Existing mitigation controls Preventative maintenance programmes and new investments to reduce risk of interruption of manufacturing.
A Group Fire Safety Policy mandating preventive detective and containment controls.
Alternate manufacturing capacity exists for a substantial portion of the Groups product range.
Core sites are required to maintain a Business Continuity Plan for use in the event of a serious business disruption.
Inventory maintained to absorb and flatten out raw material supply and production volatility.
The Group has comprehensive insurance policies to mitigate the impact of a number of these risks.

Succession planning and the ability to swiftly replace staff retiring or leaving is also critical.
LINK TO STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES Potential impact Failure to retain attract or motivate the required calibre of employees will negatively impact business performance.
The delivery of the STEP 2020 Strategic Plan and our strategic goals may also be delayed.
Existing mitigation controls Competitive reward programmes focused training and development and a talent retention programme.
Ongoing reviews of succession plans based on business needs.
Performance management introduced and training programmes both being extended in the new financial year.
Formal personal development review process to be rolled out in the new financial year.

T R E N D T R E N D Liquidity Foreign Exchange and Banking Arrangements Detailed risk A lack of sufficient liquidity and flexibility in banking arrangements could inhibit the Groups ability to invest for the future or in extremes restrict day to day operations.
In the past banking markets and Renolds own performance have made access to debt facilities difficult.
LINK TO STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES Potential impact Potentially cause underinvestment and suboptimal shortterm decision making.
Limiting investment could prevent efficiency savings and reduce competitiveness.
In an extreme situation the Groups ability to operate as a Going Concern could also be jeopardised.
Existing mitigation controls The Groups primary banking facility expires in May 2020 and is fully available given current levels of profitability.
The facility includes additional draw down capability accessible as long as financial covenants are complied with.

45 672017 30021 PM 2529004 AR 2017 Proof 3 PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES Pensions Deficit Volatility Detailed risk The principal pensions risk is that shortterm cash funding requirements of legacy pension scheme diverts much needed investment away from the Groups operations.
Secondly the size of the reported balance sheet deficit can operate as a disincentive to potential investors or other stakeholders.
Thirdly balance sheet deficits can fluctuate based on market conditions outside the control of management.
LINK TO STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES Potential impact Given the Groups cash needs to invest in the business the pace of performance improvement could be slowed if cash has to be diverted to the pension schemes.
The balance sheet pension deficit and its volatility could act as a disincentive to potential investors and could reduce the Groups ability to raise new equity or debt financing.
Existing mitigation controls The Pension Strategy has been updated to 2020.
The major UK pension cash flows 50% of all defined benefit pension cash costs are stable under the 25 year asset backed funding scheme put in place during 2013.
A further 25% of the annual cash flows are pensions in payment in Germany in a mature scheme that has passed its peak funding requirement.
All pension risks are actively managed in line with the Groups risk management system covering investment and liability management issues.
Regulatory and Legal Compliance Detailed risk The risk of censure fine or business prohibition as a result of any part of the Group failing to comply with regulatory or legal obligations.
Risks related to regulatory and legislative changes include the inability of the Group to comply with current changing or new requirements.
Many of the Groups business activities are subject to increasing regulation and enforcement by relevant authorities.
LINK TO STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES Potential impact Failure by the Group or its representatives to abide by applicable laws and regulations could result in Administrative civil or criminal liability.
Significant fines and penalties.
Suspension of the Group from trading.
Reputational damage.
Existing mitigation controls Communication of a clear compliance culture.
Risk assessments and ongoing compliance reviews at least annually at all major locations.

46 672017 30026 PM 2529004 AR 2017 Proof 3 Viability Statement The UK Corporate Governance Code requires the Directors to assess the prospects of the Group over a period significantly longer than 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
The 12 month requirement was the basis for assessing the Going Concern basis.
The Groups STEP 2020 Strategic Plan covers the three year period to March 2020.
The Groups core financing facility expires in May 2020 but following normal market practice is likely to be renegotiated at least 12 months earlier.
The Board determined that the period to March 2020 was the appropriate and relevant period over which to perform the viability review as it would be based on a set of forecasts already contained in the Groups Strategic Plan.
The Board is not aware of any reason why the Group would not be able to refinance its core financing facility prior to expiry on comparable market based terms at that time.
As in prior years the Board and Audit Committee have continued to review and assess the Groups ongoing risk appetite register of principal risks and progress on actions to mitigate the probability and impact of risks crystallising.
The internal control structures and processes described on pages 66 to 68 also serve to mitigate overexposure to single risk events that could threaten the Groups longer term viability.
While all risks have the potential to impact longer term viability the principal risks deemed more relevant for a reasonable assessment of viability are set out below Strategy Execution the risk of the Groups inability to successfully implement the STEP 2020 Strategic Plan which could lead to the Group continuing to experience volatile financial results and weak levels of cash generation.
This has the additional potential impact of making it difficult to refinance the Group in 2019.
Macroeconomic and political volatility uncertainty driven by global events is undoubtedly suppressing demand.
These events range from Brexit pressure on the stability of the Eurozone and volatility in the US.
As an international manufacturing business the Group is dependent on stable trading environments to deliver our products and shareholder value.
A catastrophic failure in the Eurozone or the European Union e.
Groups longer term prospects.
The Board has continued to review the STEP 2020 Strategic Plan during the current year.
This included an additional detailed review of our markets competitors and product strategies in addition to financial forecasts.
The detailed review assessed the results of stress tests on financial forecasts and also financing options around our acquisition strategy in Phase III of the STEP 2020 Strategic Plan.
In these stress tests a number of scenarios were reviewed including one in which sales levels were a further 10% below the year ended 31 March 2017 and a second in which sales growth was limited to being 50% below future growth plans.
The Board thereby assessed the potential impact of the risks noted above which could affect solvency or liquidity in severe but plausible scenarios over the three year period and concluded that the business would remain viable.
The Group maintains a conservative approach to borrowing and while our banking covenants have leverage limits of 2.5x Adjusted EBITDA the Board makes a point of seeking always to operate within an internally imposed 2.0x leverage limit which ensures there is access to a short term borrowing buffer to cope with any shortterm financial shocks.
The Groups currently expanded capital investment programme was also included in viability assessments to confirm the degree and period for which it could be curtailed without doing permanent long term damage to the business.
Current capital spend plans are significantly ahead of what could reasonably be described as maintenance capital spend and hence provide additional comfort.
Based on the results of the processes described above and the Boards overall comprehensive and proactive approach to risk management the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of assessment.

STRA TEGIC REPORT Renold AR2017Proof3.
49 672017 30033 PM 2529004 AR 2017 Proof 3 The Board is mindful of the importance to the business of its responsibility to stakeholders and the wider community.
We recognise our duty to behave responsibly towards all stakeholders in our business including shareholders employees customers suppliers and communities in which we operate.
Our approach to corporate social responsibility has three key elements our people our community and our environment.
The commitment to our people includes the provision of a rewarding and safe environment for our employees and the way in which we work according to our Values.
Detailed information in relation to health and safety matters is reported upon at pages 48 and 49 of this Annual Report.
The Board has overall responsibility for corporate social responsibility with the Chief Executive taking direct leadership responsibility supported by the regional and business unit Executive teams.
Aligned to this is our continuous commitment to uphold good corporate governance principles in respect of which further details are set out in our Corporate Governance Report on pages 58 to 59.
Our employees The Group requires motivated talented employees with a clear understanding of their role within the business in order to deliver our Strategic Objectives.
Consequently Renold remains actively focused on the delivery of actions in the following areas Talent acquisition and optimisation of organisation structures Attracting recruiting and retaining talented individuals and optimising our organisational structures to enable them to operate effectively.
Values behaviours and engagement Establishing a values driven working environment that actively engages employees.
Creating a high performance culture Recognising and rewarding strong performance and identifying opportunities for learning and development.
Compliance
Ensuring compliance with employment regulations wherever we operate.
In line with the STEP 2020 Strategic Plan the Group has continued to build upon the foundation laid down in previous years and to make progress in each of these key areas.
Talent acquisition and optimisation of organisation structures As in previous years the Group has continued to review and strengthen the management team and organisation structures with new appointments into key roles including Group Finance Director Managing Director  Couplings and Managing Director Chain  South East
The business has increasingly been able to focus on clarifying developing and strengthening the capability of management and staff at deeper levels in the organisation.
Our recruitment processes to enable the sourcing and assessment of high calibre people at the right time into well defined roles with clear deliverables and accountabilities continues to evolve.
As our understanding of what it takes to be successful in our business develops we are able to focus on the key competencies and capacities that are critical to identify in future hires.
In particular a more rigorous use of skills assessments in areas such as numerical and verbal reasoning and the insistence on standards of high performance in these areas is beginning to bear fruit.
The Company will continue to refine and standardise our capability in this area in the coming financial year particularly with the introduction of a consistent methodology for definition activation and assessment of roles and candidates across the Group globally.
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY We believe that our commitment to corporate social responsibility is integral to ensuring the protection of the long term interests of our shareholders.
Our Commitments Provide a rewarding and safe working environment Work in accordance with our values Act in an ethical manner in all our business relationships Work with the communities in which we operate Minimise the environmental impact of our products and processes Renold plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 for the year ended 31 March 2017 Renold AR2017Proof3.
50 672017 30037 PM 2529004 AR 2017 Proof 3 As in the past Renold continues to implement programmes to develop home grown talent.
We continue to operate our apprenticeship programmes particularly in the UK and
The UK currently has seven apprentices within our Torque Transmission business and is planning to add several more in the coming year.
Our Chain business in Einbeck Germany has 21 apprentices working across a broad range of levels and disciplines including engineering technical administration and logistics functions.
From the coming financial year onwards Renold will be making a contribution to the Apprenticeship Levy.
In order to ensure that we are in a position to fully maximise our utilisation of the funds from the levy we are working with an external organisation The Skills Company to develop a bespoke action plan specifically tailored to the future needs of Renold.
We anticipate for the UK in particular that this will enhance the uptake in apprenticeships and the delivery of training to apprentices.
Renold has also continued to develop the Future Leaders Graduate Programme in the past year.
Through an assessment process designed to objectively identify graduates with future leadership potential we employed six additional graduates onto the programme in the UK.
Each of these graduate Future Leaders has had a real job in the organisation from their first day of employment and are participants in a structured programme of training and development with 12 training modules being delivered by external experts over a two year period.
These modules aim to provide participants with a broad range of skills and knowledge to act as a base upon which they can further develop as their careers progress.
Additionally they have the opportunity to be involved in critical business projects and have regular exposure to the senior leadership team.
The new graduates were recruited in September 2016 into diverse functions including business systems engineering commercial and manufacturing operations.
Including the Future Leaders we recruited in September 2015 we now have eleven employees in this important programme.
It is particularly pleasing that to date we have had no turnover in our Future Leaders cohort.
We expect this programme to be one of the key processes through which the business continues to ensure that we internally develop our leaders of the future.
The intention in the next financial year is to seek to broaden the geographic scope of the programme beyond Europe.
Finally this year we defined and selectively deployed a Talent Review Process.
The process focused on a review of staff in key areas of the business and assesses both the performance and the longer term potential of those individuals and teams.
Based on those evaluations senior management teams were able to prioritise the key actions required in order to address both the short and longer term issues that were identified.
This process will be repeated each year enabling us to create a straightforward and practical continuous improvement ethos in the area of talent development.
STRA TEGIC REPORT Renold AR2017Proof3.
51 672017 30042 PM 2529004 AR 2017 Proof 3 Values behaviour and engagement The Renold Values and Behaviours continue to act as an important standard to which we hold both ourselves and our employees.
Since the launch of the Renold Values we have continued the work of embedding these in the business.
The Values and Behaviours are clearly communicated across the Group and are increasingly becoming integrated into the way in which we do things.
In particular we have focused on ensuring that our recruitment methodology incorporates our Values and Behaviours and that we specifically seek future hires who are able to demonstrate alignment with these desirable traits.
The Company has also incorporated an evaluation of senior manager awareness and adherence to our Values and Behaviours into our Performance and Development Review Process.
Across our global locations we continue to align the requirement to embed Organisational Values and Behaviours in the terms and conditions of employment.
The importance of our Values is emphasised during the induction process for new employees.
We plan to continue to focus on the process of further embedding our Values and Behaviours in the business as Renold continues to develop ensuring that for the longterm our Values and Behaviours shape our evolving culture.
Creating a high performance culture Given the importance of setting clear expectations and targets for employees and regularly reviewing them the Company launched in 2016 a new Performance and Development Review process.
The process initially focused on senior managers and other key role holders and has generated positive feedback from both groups.
The process supports the setting and recording of goals and expectations and provides a consistent mechanism for measuring and monitoring employee performance against these expectations.
Simultaneously this process will encourage the identification of development needs including coaching training and other development opportunities to enable enhanced performance against expectations in the future.
Straightforward action plans to address issues arising from these reviews will be created and regularly reviewed to ensure progress.
Renold will continue to develop the process cascading it throughout the business.
We will also seek ways of gathering feedback to refine and improve the process.
The Company has developed a bespoke management skills programme designed to provide our managers with the necessary knowledge and skills to be able to more effectively manage their teams and deliver their business objectives.
This programme will be implemented over the coming months in a modular fashion.
Action plans for each individual will be created within each module to ensure that the learning is embedded in the day to day activity of the attendees.
The line managers of attendees will also be given training to ensure that they are in a position to support the development of managers as they return from each training session.
The pilot will be evaluated as it is implemented with the intention to further refine the content and delivery and enable continued roll out of the programme to a wider audience.
The delivery of targeted development activities and programmes designed to enhance the capability and performance of our employees is clearly a growing priority as we strive to develop our high performing culture.
During the coming financial year we will further develop our capability to identify and deliver a broader suite of programmes for a wider geographic audience.
Compliance
Arrangements for consulting and involving Group employees on matters affecting their interests at work are developed in ways appropriate to each business.
A variety of approaches is adopted aimed at encouraging the involvement of employees in effective communication and consultation and the contribution of productive ideas at all levels.
The Groups intranet site enables access to the latest Group information as well as Group policies.
We also undertake regular presentations to employees throughout the Group where the half year and year end financial results are presented and explained by senior management.
This helps to achieve a common awareness amongst employees of the financial and economic factors affecting the performance of the
Employment policies are designed to provide equal opportunities irrespective of race caste national origin religion age disability gender marital status sexual orientation or political affiliation.
Group policy is to ensure that disabled applicants for employment are given full and fair consideration having regard to their particular aptitudes and abilities and that existing disabled employees are given equal access to training career development and promotion opportunities.
In the event of existing employees becoming disabled all reasonable means would be explored to achieve retention in employment in the same or an alternative capacity including arranging appropriate training.
We monitor developments in employment law that may affect our employees in the regions in which we operate and make adjustments as necessary.
We are also aware of the necessity to develop proposals to enable the Group to be compliant with gender pay gap reporting legislation requiring employers to calculate their gender pay gap from April 2017 and formally report the details by April 2018.
Business integrity and ethics We operate the business in an ethical and responsible manner and we expect our employees and business operations to conduct themselves ethically and to be honest fair and courteous in their dealings.
The highest standards of ethical business conduct are required of our employees in the performance of their duties.

Every Renold employee has the responsibility to ask questions seek guidance and report suspected violations of the Groups code of ethics.
A free of charge independent whistle blowing hotline continues to be available to all employees across the Group enabling them to report any concerns about theft fraud and other malpractice in the workplace.
The Group is also committed to compliance with anticorruption laws in all countries and operates a zero tolerance policy.
The Group AntiCorruption policy forms part of that commitment together with the Gifts and Hospitality policy both of which are designed to assist Renold employees in meeting corporate and individual obligations under anticorruption laws.
Implementation of these policies followed the coming into force of the UK Bribery Act in 2011.
Each business unit is required to maintain a register of gifts and hospitality which is submitted and reviewed by the Group Finance and Legal functions on a biannual basis.
Sites will be challenged where any gift or hospitality appears in the first instance to have been given or received outside of the terms of the Gifts and Hospitality Policy.
Other control processes and updates to formal contractual arrangements with agents and distributors have been put in place to ensure compliance with the requirements of the UK Bribery Act.
In addition an annual training programme is in place for all members of staff whose roles involve working in environments or activities where there is a perceived risk.
The training is also undertaken by external parties such as agents.
The underlying objective in all these measures is to maintain the highest standards of integrity throughout the business and ensure that all business dealings are transparent.
Human rights The Group is required to make a disclosure in relation to human rights.
The Board has overall responsibility for ensuring the Group upholds and promotes respect for human rights and has adopted the definition of human rights within the European Convention on Human Rights the concept of human beings as having universal rights or status regardless of legal jurisdiction or other localising factors such as ethnicity nationality and sex.
The Group respects all human rights and in conducting its business regards the right to nondiscrimination and fair treatment as the most relevant to its key stakeholder groups these being customers employees and suppliers.
The Groups employment policies and procedures reflect principles of equal treatment.
Respect for the individual is also enshrined in Renolds statement of Values and Behaviours.
The Group has not been made aware of any incident in which the organisations activities have resulted in an abuse of human rights.
Following the introduction of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 we have published a statement on our website which sets out the steps being taken by the Group to ensure that slavery and human trafficking are not taking place in the business or the supply chain relating to our goods.
The Group is committed to ensuring that our business and business partners do not undertake any activity which contravenes the Modern Slavery Act.
Diversity
The Group is committed to equal opportunities and operates a non discriminatory working environment.
We expect staff and job applicants to be treated equally regardless of age race religion disability gender or sexuality.
As at 31 March 2017 the Group employed 2139 people including 348 in the UK.
Of the total number of employees 368 17% are female.
The Company recognises the need to encourage and support more gender diversity throughout the employee population as well as at Board level.
Set out in the charts opposite is a breakdown of the gender of our Board members and in accordance with new reporting requirements introduced last year the number of senior managers including directors of the Companys subsidiary companies and employees as at 31 March 2017.
A senior manager is defined in the legislation as an employee who has responsibility for planning directing or controlling the activities of a company or a strategically significant part of a company.

Although the Group is limited in our ability to provide extensive financial support to projects we do seek to provide support where we can in a number of ways.
During this financial year the Company agreed to support The Outward Bound
The Trust is an educational charity that uses the outdoors to help develop young people from all walks of life.
They run adventurous and challenging outdoor learning programmes that equip young people with valuable skills for education work and life.
This helps participants to become more confident more effective and more capable at school college and in the workplace.
Although in the early stages of this partnership in addition to providing some financial support to the Trust we are in discussions with them about how we can arrange for a number of our employees to become involved in the activities of the Trust in particular acting as mentors to the young people attending the outdoor learning programmes.
As well as supporting the amazing work that the Trust does this will help with the engagement and development of our own employees particularly those that participate in the mentoring opportunities.
We plan to continue our relationship with The Outward Bound Trust into the next financial year.
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Also this year in a proactive response to the BroadBased Black Economic Empowerment BBBEE legislation in South Africa Renold South Africa has implemented its own BBBEE trust.
Renold
South Africa has sold a new special class of share to the trust the Renold SA Development Trust by way of loan funding.
The BBBEE Act 2003 was introduced as a form of economic empowerment initiated by the South African Government in response to criticism of earlier statutory changes that had failed to lead to the enrichment of disadvantaged individuals.
The goal of BBBEE is to distribute wealth across as broad a spectrum of previously disadvantaged South African citizens as possible.
Companies operating in South Africa are required to transform their businesses by operating according to the Codes of Good Practice implemented to give force to the BBBEE Act.
Based on the Codes companies receive a rating indicating the level of compliance.
The objectives of the Renold SA Development Trust are to provide training and development andor further education in industrial manufacturing engineering and general business fields and to assisting other BBBEE initiatives of Renold SAs customers.
Beneficiaries can therefore be employees e. customers own BBBEE initiatives.
We are delighted to be a supporter of the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester having been involved in the Manchester Science Festival Supporters Circle for a further year.

Scope 1 emissions are from those direct sources that are owned by the Group e. gas within our facilities boilers and heaters.
Fugitive gases are not included.
Scope 2 emissions comprise those emissions for which the Group is indirectly responsible excluding transmission and distribution losses e. from the electricity we purchase to operate machinery or equipment.
An amendment made during 2015 to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol incorporates two calculation methodologies for scope 2 emissions.
There are no contractual instruments in place for the purchase of renewable energy.
Hence we report the same figure when applying the market and location based methodologies.
The UK Government guidance was considered when selecting the Companys chosen intensity measurement which is total emissions reported normalised to m external revenue for the financial year ending 31 March 2017.
The calculation methodology is based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol developed jointly by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development.
Our environment The environmental impact of our activities is at the forefront of our strategy.
Across all our operations we meet all legislative requirements concerning environmental issues including those relating to energy usage.
As a part of the Groups commitment to minimising the impacts of its business operations on the environment we cooperate with regulators suppliers neighbours and customers to develop and achieve improved standards of environmental protection.
All of our production facilities either hold or are working towards ISO 14001.
During the year a range of projects have delivered further environmental improvements.
These include emission reductions at our Hangzhou site waste reduction initiatives across a number of sites and insulation improvements from new and modified roofing structures.
Our
Energy Saving Opportunities Scheme
ESOS is a mandatory energy assessment scheme for organisations in the UK that meet the qualification criteria.
The
Environment Agency is the UK scheme administrator.
Renold qualifies for ESOS and must carry out ESOS assessments every four years.
These assessments are audits of the energy used in our buildings industrial processes and transport to identify costeffective energy saving measures.
To deliver our obligations under phase 1 of the ESOS legislation we opted to undertake an ESOS Energy Survey.
A specialist consultancy was appointed to assist the Company in completing the survey in June 2015.
The reported findings are being used to inform the development of a series of energy reduction and management measures.
Greenhouse gas GHG emissions Renold continues to comply with its obligations under the carbon reporting requirements of The Companies Act 2006 Strategic Report and Directors Report Regulations 2013.
Energy usage across the Group is collated using data captured through the Groups Integrated Risk Management web based IT system.
This energy consumption database makes data readily available.
Data is actively reviewed in order to target additional energy reduction programmes.
The main contributors to GHG emissions arise from our use of electricity and fuels such as natural gas and fuel oil burnt on our premises.
The table below shows the Groups GHG data in tonnes for the last four financial years across all locations derived from the consumption data collected and the DEFRA and International Energy Agency published conversion factor tables.
Renold continues to sustain an underlying reduction in energy usage.

As a result this year Renold India has been working with communities and relevant stakeholders to assist local government schools in the provision of better infrastructure and educational facilities.
Renold Indias Corporate Social Responsibility Vision has been formulated in connection with the statutory requirement in India.
The areas listed in the statute include promoting education.
Renold India believes that education is the tool for creating an empowered enlightened society.
More than 60% of children in India are enrolled in government schools however the infrastructure and facilities and quality of the education are often below acceptable levels.
Through better facilities and higher quality education all round it is anticipated there will be a reduction in the dropout rate of students.
The programme has been developed following discussions with local school management and covers the following To support government schools with basic access to infrastructure.
To support government schools with digital learning and teaching systems capacity building of teachers career orientation and counselling.
Life skills and spoken English projects supporting the vocational skills sessions in the schools.
Providing lighting facilities for schools through solar energy.
Contributions have been made to change certain basic infrastructures including the building of walls to improve security installation of electrical facilities such as fans and lights and the building of rest rooms for female students which are often lacking in local schools.

Board changes This year has seen significant changes to the Board which demonstrate the Boards commitment to orderly succession planning.
In January 2017 we welcomed our new Group Finance Director Ian Scapens to the Board and a further NonExecutive Director David Landless.
Both new Directors will play vital roles as we continue to implement our STEP 2020 Strategic Plan.

David was most recently Group Finance Director of Bodycote plc for 17 years and has significant experience at senior levels of international businesses in the industrials sector.
Davids appointment was a successful step in Renolds succession planning process for Board members which was outlined in the Nomination Committee Report in the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts.
David will become Chairman of the Audit Committee on completion of the AGM on 19 July 2017 succeeding John Allkins who will step down after nine years in the role.
John is also currently Senior Independent Director and Ian Griffiths will step into this role after the AGM.
John will continue as a NonExecutive Director until the conclusion of the 2018 AGM facilitating a valuable handover period to David in particular.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank John for his extremely valuable contribution to the Board and his Chairmanship of the Audit Committee to date.

The Company has a detailed framework for the induction of new
This includes the issuing of all key documents relating to the new Directors role on the Board as well as site visits and facetoface meetings with senior executives.
Throughout the year the Executive Directors have continued to visit Renold sites around the world including the USA India France South Africa Germany and Australia.
The Board itself also met during the year at both of Renolds manufacturing sites in Germany and at a UK manufacturing site.
NonExecutive Director independence The NonExecutive Directors are considered to be independent in character and judgement notwithstanding in the case of John Allkins that he has served on the Board for more than nine years.
The Board is of the opinion that all of the Directors take decisions objectively and in the best interests of the Company and that no individual or small group of individuals can dominate the Boards decision making.
The balance between NonExecutive and Executive Directors allows independent challenge to the Executive Directors and senior management.
Board evaluation and effectiveness The Board is supportive of the principle of evaluation of the Board as set out in paragraph B.6 of the 2014 Code and recognises that evaluation of its performance is important in enabling it to realise its maximum potential.
A formal process for evaluating the performance of the Board its members and its Committees is planned and is conducted annually.
This process gives the Directors the opportunity to identify areas for improvement both jointly and individually through the use of questionnaires andor open discussion.
An evaluation of the Chairman is also carried out annually led by the Senior Independent NonExecutive Director.
In addition evaluations of the Audit Committee the Nomination Committee and the Remuneration Committee were also carried out during the year.
The evaluation process commences with the completion of a written questionnaire for each separate review compilation of a summary of the results and feedback obtained and then discussion between the participants.
The subsequent Board discussion highlighted a number of areas where objectives might be set by the Board and practical issues for consideration.
The Board has continued to allocate separate time for review and consideration of the STEP 2020 Strategic Plan.
In accordance with the 2014 Code the evaluation process also included a number of discussions during the year between the Chairman and the NonExecutive Directors without the Executive Directors present to discuss feedback arising from the process and the performance of each Executive Director.
The Senior Independent Director also met with the other Directors as part of the Chairmans performance evaluation process.
Election of Directors The 2014 Code recommends that all Directors of FTSE 350 companies should be subject to annual election by shareholders.
This provision is not applicable to the Company.
However with a view to complying voluntarily with all terms of the Governance Code where practical all NonExecutive Directors are subject to annual election.

The Board is accountable to shareholders and therefore it is important for the Board to appreciate the requirements of shareholders and equally that shareholders understand how the actions of the Board and short term financial performance relate to the achievement of longer term goals.
The NonExecutive Directors make themselves available to meet shareholders on request can attend shareholder visits at Company sites and are available for discussions with analysts and the Companys broker.
The reporting calendar is driven by the publication of interim and final results each year in which the Board reports to shareholders on its management of the Company.
Formal regulatory news service announcements are also made in accordance with the Companys reporting obligations.
Comments on Group financial performance in the context of the business risks faced and objectives and plans for the future are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 40 to 46.
The Company continues to keep shareholders informed of its strategy and progress at other times during the year with updates provided to the London Stock Exchange and shareholders via the Companys website at site The Board receives feedback from the Companys brokers throughout the year.
In addition the Chief Executive and Finance Director meet with major shareholders and potential investors to discuss Group strategy and performance and update the Board as a whole accordingly at each meeting.
The Board also receives reports prior to each Board meeting which set out the main changes to the composition of the Companys share register.
The Senior Independent NonExecutive Director does not generally attend meetings with shareholders although he makes himself available to attend such meetings if and when required.
Whilst the Company is not in compliance with paragraph E1.1 of the 2014 Code the Chairman ensures that the Chief Executive and Finance Director provide feedback to the Board following presentations to investors and meetings with shareholders and analysts and brokers briefings are circulated to all Directors in order to ensure that Board members and in particular NonExecutive Directors develop an understanding of the views of major shareholders about their Company.

We monitor the integrity of financial information published externally for use by shareholders.
We also ensure that the integrity of the financial statements is supported by an effective external audit.
We monitor that effective control structures operate over major change initiatives and targeted benefits are delivered.
We also support the efforts of the executive team to continuously improve the financial control and risk monitoring environment.
Our approach is to ensure that risk management operates to preempt potential business issues and that embedded proactive financial controls prevent or mitigate unnecessary losses that may arise if a business risk does crystallise.

71 672017 30238 PM 2529004 AR 2017 Proof 3 Defined benefit pension accounting recurring annual item see Note 18 to the financial statements Defined benefit pension scheme accounting is a complex matter.
The values disclosed can fluctuate materially particularly in a period of significant changes in gilt yields and interest rates.
The values disclosed are also sensitive to a range of assumptions where judgement is required.
This is illustrated in the table below.
Assumption sensitivity Change in liability Impact of 0.25% increase in UK discount rates 7.7m decrease Impact of 0.25% decrease in UK discount rates 8.7m increase Impact of 0.25% increase in UK inflation rates 5.0m increase Impact of 0.25% decrease in UK inflation rates 4.6m decrease Impact of 1 year higher life expectancy in UK 10.3m increase As has been the case for a number of years the Committee reviews management estimates which are produced following independent actuarial advice and are compared to third party benchmarks on the reasonableness of the assumptions used.
We ensure the Groups underlying assumptions and methodology used in deriving them are consistent year on year or are justified by experience of the scheme or by third party metrics.
In respect of the relatively high mortality assumption the Committee considered extensive scheme specific data which underpins and supports the level of mortality assumed by the Group.
The Committee was satisfied that the assumptions are within an acceptable range and no changes were made to management assumptions.
The Committee has also encouraged additional disclosure of forward looking financial information in respect of defined benefit pension schemes.
Largely graphical in nature this is designed to give greater clarity of the risks issues and opportunities in what is a complex area of accounting see pages 38 and 39 of the Finance Directors Review.
The Committee considered again but continues to conclude that the financing charges and administration costs of the closed defined benefit pension schemes should for the purposes of assessing underlying performance as reported in adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS be excluded from these calculations.
The costs involved relate to closed legacy pension schemes that have no bearing or relevance to understanding the underlying performance of the ongoing business see Note 18 to the financial statements.
Whilst the judgements on assumptions used in arriving at the deficit numbers is judged to be low as these use known published dataindices there is more judgement in the nature of the disclosure hence the overall judgement required is viewed as moderate.
Review of carrying value of intangible assets deferred tax assets and investments in subsidiary undertakings recurring annual item see Note 7 Note 8 and Note 17 to the financial statements The Group holds a number of valuable intangible assets such as goodwill and deferred tax.
In addition the parent company and other subsidiary holding companies hold investments in various subsidiaries which are relevant in their individual statutory accounts as opposed to the consolidated financial statements.
The judgements on the carrying value of these assets are normally a key area for Committee scrutiny as carrying values are based on discounted estimates of future profitability over a number of years and hence are highly sensitive to the assumptions used.
These are areas where management estimates play a key role in supporting the carrying values reported in the balance sheet.
The
Committee reviews the assumptions underlying the discounted cash flow calculations and the likelihood of longterm recovery of the asset values.
The details of the impairment reviews performed are in Note 7.
Shortterm cash flows are confirmed by reference to the Board approved budget for the following year and sense checked against the longer term Strategic Plan.
This is also a key area of focus for the external Auditor.
As part of the review of defined benefit pension accounting the Committee also reviews the carrying value and recoverability of the deferred tax assets the corollary of the gross pension deficit.
The
Committee was satisfied that the extended duration of the pension liabilities in Germany and the UK and their priority in recognition justified the extended recovery periods for the associated deferred tax assets which were also fully supported by expectations of future taxable profitability.
Review of inventory valuation and provisioning recurring annual item see Note 11 to the financial statements As a manufacturer the Group adds value to raw materials as part of its normal production processes.
In order to provide shorter lead times and better customer service the Group also holds a significant amount of stock.
Inventory therefore represents a material component of the Groups balance sheet.
The basis of valuation always includes the allocation of amounts for labour and overhead costs which require the exercise of management judgement.
The overall process is governed by understood accounting methodologies for the absorption of labour and overheads into stock.
Whilst these methodologies help to reduce risk based on the scale of inventory holdings and the extensive product range the overall level of judgement required is assessed as moderate.
The Committee reviews in some detail both the valuation bases and the application of the Groups policy on providing for slow moving and obsolete stock.
The Committee reviews both the rules governing the automatic generation of provisions based on the age of stock and any management judgemental overrides.
The
Committee is satisfied that the net book value shown in Note 11 is appropriate and that any management judgements formed in arriving at those values are reasonable.

72 672017 30240 PM 2529004 AR 2017 Proof 3 Review of the Viability Statement recurring annual item see page 47 In accordance with provision C2.2 of the UK Corporate Governance Code the Board is required to assess the prospects of the Company over a period longer than 12 months from the approval of the financial statements.
In addition to the Going Concern report the Committee has helped the Board prepare the viability statement and the period over which it will apply.
The Committee considered the STEP 2020 Strategic Plan and sensitivities against the Plan in preparing the Viability Statement as well as the appropriateness of the three year review period.
The Companys current position and principal risks were also reviewed in detail by the Committee prior to advising the
The Companys full Viability Statement can be found on page 47 of the Strategic Report.
Other matters reviewed by the Committee Corporate risk reporting processes and action plans The annual process for control selfassurance and reporting Reviewing medium term financial planning assumptions and The ongoing programme to improve the efficiency of financial control processes in the business.
Reporting of exceptional items current year focus item see Note 2c to the financial statements The STEP 2020 Strategic Plan envisages and requires a number of years of restructuring activity within the Group.
Each year the Committee focuses on and challenges managements allocation of costs and credits between exceptional items and ordinary items.
We ensure that the exceptional charges genuinely need to be excluded so as to allow users of the accounts to form an accurate assessment of the performance of the underlying business.
We concluded that the net charges were sufficiently material and not related to the underlying business so as to require separate disclosure.
Internal control risk and compliance We regularly evaluate the integrity of financial reporting and the robustness of internal controls to ensure compliance with applicable legal and internal requirements.
We also review the Groups policies and procedures for identifying material business risks and action plans aimed at reducing the likelihood of risks crystallising and mitigating the impact if they do.
The ERMMC receive regular reports from the Group Head of Risk and Assurance to convey the status of risk profiles and actions arising from the risk assessment process.
The ERMMC reports the results of its discussions to the Committee.
Further details of our internal control and risk management systems including the financial reporting process can be found on pages 40 and 41 and page 68.
Our primary risk factors are shown in the Strategic Report on pages 42 to 46.
Even though cyber security is not considered a key risk due to the devolved and diffuse nature of the systems environment and the IT estate the Committee did review cyber security risk.
It reviewed policies and current mitigation strategies as well as third party testing of aspects of cyber security.
Confidential reporting procedures and whistle blowing The stewardship of the Groups assets and the integrity of the financial statements are further supported by confidential reporting and whistle blowing procedures.
The Committee reviews these procedures once a year to ensure that appropriate processes are in place to treat complaints confidentially and implement proportionate and independent investigation in all cases.
The
Committee is diligent in ensuring a high degree of visibility and accessibility of whistle blowing communications methods to all staff including first hand inspection during site visits.
The Committee considers the number and nature of reports received in the year to be small in number and scale of risk in comparison to businesses of a similar size and geographical distribution.
Internal audit The Committee receives and considers reports on the control environment from the Group Head of Risk and Assurance.
These reports highlight key improvement themes and recommend areas for business focus with additional observations provided around root cause analysis and cultural and behavioural themes.
In addition the Committee has visibility of management responses and action tracking via the Groups IRMS at each meeting.
The audit plan which contains mandatory riskbased and cyclical reviews was approved by the Committee in March 2016 and was built around focus areas such as organisational change major projects IT security business resilience and capital spend.
In the new financial year the plan will include site financial control audits site health and safety audits and project assurance.
External audit The Committee is responsible for overseeing relations with the external Auditor including the approval of fees and makes recommendations to the Board on their appointment and where appropriate reappointment based upon reviews of audit effectiveness.
Details of total remuneration for the Auditor for the year including audit services audit related services and other nonaudit services can be found in Note 2b to the consolidated financial statements.

Renold AR2017Proof3.
73 672017 30244 PM 2529004 AR 2017 Proof 3 AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT Auditor independence and objectivity The independence of the external Auditor is essential to the provision of an objective opinion on the true and fair view presented in the financial statements.
Auditor independence and objectivity is safeguarded by limiting the nature and value of non audit services performed by the external Auditor.
The Group has a policy of not recruiting senior employees of the external Auditor who have worked on the audit in the past two years to senior financial positions within the Group and the rotation of the lead engagement partner at least every five years.
The current lead engagement partner was appointed during the audit tender process in June 2015 and this is therefore the second year end they have been in post.
Nonaudit services provided by the external Auditor The Committee is responsible for ensuring that an appropriate relationship is maintained between the Group and the external
Nonaudit services can only be provided by the external Auditor if there is no potential conflict of interest or material risk of values being included in the financial statements that have been both advised on and audited by the external Auditor.
To safeguard the independence and objectivity of the Auditor the Committee has approved a policy on nonaudit services provided by the Auditor in line with professional practice and in accordance with ethical standards published by the Audit Practices Board.
Control of nonaudit services is exercised by ensuring that all nonaudit services where fees exceed an agreed limit are subject to the prior approval of the Committee.
The policy is available on the website at site During the year ended 31 March 2017 the Committee continued with the appointment of other accountancy firms to provide non audit services to the Group and anticipates that this will continue during the year ending 31 March 2018.
Total nonaudit services provided by Deloitte during the year ended 31 March 2017 were nil 2016 nil.
Total audit and audit related fees include the statutory audit fee and fees paid to Deloitte for other services which the external Auditor is required to perform.
Examples might include reporting to banking partners in territories where no statutory accounts are required to be prepared.
Non audit fees represent all other services provided by Deloitte not included in the above.
There were no significant nonaudit services provided by Deloitte in the year.
The Committee also discussed the overall level of fees and considered them appropriate given the current size of the Group.
The Committee is satisfied that the level and scope of nonaudit services undertaken by the external Auditor does not impair its independence or objectivity and considers that the Company receives particular benefit from the advice provided by its external Auditor given its wide and detailed knowledge of the Group and its international operations.
Audit focus To ensure appropriate focus on key risk areas identified by the Committee the proposed external audit plan is challenged before the audit commences to ensure that Deloitte have developed appropriately targeted audit procedures.
These are closely aligned with the current year focus items noted above in the section Main activities of the Committee during the year.
They also reflect the relative changes in profitability and materiality of each of the Groups operating units during the year in some cases as a result of the ongoing restructuring activities.
Assessment of effectiveness of external audit The Committee has a formal system for evaluating the performance and independence of the external Auditor.
This system involves active dialogue with the Lead Engagement Partner a formal questionnaire and feedback process involving senior management in direct contact with the audit team and Deloittes response to accounting financial control and audit issues as these arise.
The Committee conducts an annual review of the structure and approach taken in the external audit the level of nonaudit fees and the effectiveness independence and objectivity of the external
This includes consideration of The global external audit process.
The Auditors performance.
The expertise of the firm and our relationship with them.
The results of the questionnaire process noted above.
The results of the review are discussed with the external Auditor.
Following this years annual review the Committee was satisfied with the effectiveness independence and objectivity of the external Auditor.
As noted below the Committee has made a recommendation to the Board to reappoint Deloitte as the Groups external Auditor and a resolution to that effect will be included in the ordinary business of the AGM scheduled on Wednesday 19 July 2017.
There are no contractual obligations restricting the choice of external Auditor nor has the Company entered into any Auditor liability agreements.
Audit information Having made the requisite enquiries so far as the Directors in office at the date of the approval of this report are aware there is no relevant audit information of which the Auditor is unaware and each Director has taken all reasonable steps to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Auditor is aware of that information.

John Allkins On behalf of the Audit Committee 30 May 2017 site Stock code RNO Renold AR2017Proof3.
75 672017 30249 PM 2529004 AR 2017 Proof 3 NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT I am pleased to present the Nomination Committee Report for the year ended 31 March 2017 and to provide shareholders with an overview of the work carried out during the year under review.
This year has seen the first changes to our Board since 2012 and the Committee has led the recruitment processes for a new Group Finance Director and new NonExecutive Director in accordance with provision B2.1 of the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code 2014 Code.
Comprehensive recruitment processes were undertaken for both posts and are described below.
The Committee and the Board believe that the appointments of Ian Scapens and David Landless will be key to support the achievement of the STEP 2020 Strategic Plan.
Succession planning and recruitment of new Directors David Landless appointment to the Board forms a part of Renolds orderly succession planning process for Board members which I outlined in the Committees report last year.
David will become Chairman of the Audit Committee on completion of the 2017 AGM succeeding John Allkins who will step down after nine years in the role.
An independent recruitment consultancy Odgers Berndston Odgers was retained to assist in the recruitment of the new NonExecutive Director.
At the commencement of the recruitment process a role description was defined and agreed by the Committee detailing the skills and experience required for the position.
The requirements for the role were finalised following my meetings with Odgers who also considered the criteria proposed by the Chief Executive.
A list of candidates was identified and interviewed.
This ultimately led to the appointment of David
Following the resignation of Brian Tenner Odgers was also retained to assist in the recruitment of his replacement.
Again at the commencement of this recruitment the Committee agreed the requirements for the role with Odgers.
A longlist of candidates was refined to a shortlist and interviews were held with the Chief Executive and Group HR Director in the initial stages and subsequently myself as Chairman of the Nomination Committee and the Audit Committee Chairman.
The Committee considered Ian Scapens to be the most suitable candidate for the role and accordingly made a recommendation of appointment to the Board.
Extension of John Allkins appointment John Allkins was first appointed to the Board and as Chairman of the Audit Committee in 2008.
He completed a nine year term in April 2017 and after rigorous review the Committee proposed that his appointment as NonExecutive Director be extended for a further year from the 2017 AGM.
John Allkins will at the same time step down from the roles of Chairman of the Audit Committee and Senior Independent Director.
Having given careful consideration to the matter the Committee and the Board concluded that John Allkins continues to demonstrate the qualities of independence in character and judgement notwithstanding the fact that the extension to his appointment means he will serve a term of more than nine years.
Whilst service on the Board for more than nine years is a circumstance listed in provision B1.1 of the 2014 Code none of the other relationships or circumstances listed in B1.1 exists.
John
Allkins has made a significant and valued contribution to the Board during his tenure and his continued appointment is considered to be in the best interests of the Company.
Appointment of Senior Independent Director As a result of the above changes the Committee also considered the appointment of a new Senior Independent Director.
The
Committee recommended to the Board the appointment of Ian Griffiths to this role which will commence from the completion of the 2017 AGM.
Ian Griffiths has been an independent director since his appointment in 2010 and has chaired the Remuneration Committee since that date.
John Allkins and Ian Griffiths did not participate in the discussions or voting in the Committee which related to their own positions.
Other succession planning I reported last year that the Board is mindful of its obligations under the 2014 Code in relation to succession planning and a detailed review of succession planning for the Board and senior management took place.
The discussion as it relates to senior management concluded that good progress had been made on succession planning as a result of the continued strengthening of the management team led by the Chief Executive but that further progress was required.
This will continue to be an area of focus for the Committee.
MARK HARPER NOMINATION COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN The Nomination Committees primary focus during the year has been to lead the process for the appointment of two new directors.

76 672017 30252 PM 2529004 AR 2017 Proof 3 Board composition The Committee considers that the current capability and financial burden imposed by the Board has been appropriate in the current reporting period.
This view reflects the need to deliver excellent corporate governance while balancing the need for cost control as we continue to progress the STEP 2020 Strategic Plan.
Diversity
The Board is aware of the need to consider the benefits of diversity on the Board in all its aspects and the Board and Committee undertook both recruitments this year mindful of the issue of diversity including gender the formal Board diversity policy having been adopted and set out in the 2015 Annual Report.
The overriding objective has and will always be to appoint the best possible candidate for the role.
This year the new appointments have not changed the Boards diversity profile.
The Board continues to believe that it is not appropriate to set measurable objectives for the implementation of the Diversity policy at this time.
Effectiveness review During the year the Committee has also carried out its annual evaluation.
Again this has proved a useful exercise in reviewing the Committees work and concluding that it continues to work effectively.
Mark Harper On behalf of the Nomination Committee 30 May 2017 Role of the Nomination Committee The Committee has delegated authority from the Board.
In accordance with the 2014 Code the Committee is responsible for the following Reviewing the structure size and composition of the

There has been one Committee meeting since his appointment.
Appointments to the Board In accordance with the provisions of the 2014 Code when reviewing the Boards structure the Committees primary objective is to ensure that the Executive and NonExecutive Directors have the relevant skills knowledge and experience to create a balanced and effective Board and to support the Group in delivering its overall Strategic Objectives.
This is in parallel with ensuring that the costs and composition of the Board reflect the size of business and also the current stage of development of the business.
Our policy extends to ensuring that the various subcommittees of the Board also have an appropriate range of skills and experience to deliver their terms of reference.
In addition to skills and experience we will also consider factors such as how an individuals personal attributes would complement and enhance the diversity on the Board.
For the appointment of NonExecutive Directors additional factors for consideration include independence and time commitment.
In selecting candidates for the shortlist for any appointment the Board always considers candidates from a wide range of backgrounds and on merit and against objective criteria.
Other than in relation to gender and ethnicity the current Board is diverse in terms of the different skill sets of each member.
These include professional qualifications and career work experience but also wider experience relevant to our global business most of the Board members having worked and lived overseas for significant periods.
For further information see the chart on page 62.
A formal and rigorous process is followed during the recruitment process for a new Director.
The process for making appointments commences with the evaluation process described in the recent Board recruitments.
The Board supports the engagement of executive search firms who have signed up to the Voluntary Code of Conduct on gender diversity and best practice.

DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT
Annual Statement As Chairman of the Remuneration Committee I present the
Directors Remuneration Report
I summarise the main outcomes in the year for the remuneration of the Executive Directors and also the continued application of the remuneration policy.
Key remuneration outcomes for the year All fixed elements of pay were unchanged for the Executive Directors for a further year with base salaries having not increased since 2013 and 2010 in relation to the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director respectively.
This continues to further the strategic aim of lowering the Groups breakeven point and also reflects the ongoing Group wide pay restraint.
The key outcomes under the elements of variable pay for the year are Annual bonus The Company has again faced challenging market conditions during the year which resulted in a performance below the levels required to trigger bonus payments.
As a result no annual bonus payments were earned by the Executive Directors for the year ended 31 March 2017.
The Committee determined this outcome having formally assessed performance against EBITDA and Net Debt targets set at the beginning of the year as follows.
The adjusted EBITDA for the year ended 31 March 2017 of 20.3m was below the threshold of 24.24m required for any payment of bonus.
Average Net Debt during the year was 30.4m which was also above the threshold of 29.81m.
Performance Share Plan PSP The first awards granted under the PSP which was approved by shareholders at the 2013 AGM vested in full in July 2016.
The awards granted in 2013 required 50% growth per year in adjusted EPS for maximum vesting.
Growth of 50% per annum in adjusted EPS was achieved in the three year period ended 31 March 2016 and therefore the awards vested in full.
The performance period for the second tranche of PSP awards made in June 2014 ended on 31 March 2017.
The performance conditions required growth of 20% per year in adjusted EPS for threshold vesting.
Growth of 12.9% per annum in adjusted EPS was achieved in the three year period ended 31 March 2017 and therefore the awards will not vest.
Remuneration policy The Directors Remuneration Policy was amended last year and approved by over 90% of voting shareholders at the 2016 AGM.
The remuneration policy will continue to apply until its expiry in July 2019 unless otherwise amended.
As I stated in last years Directors Remuneration Report it is the Committees intention to undertake a full review of the remuneration policy prior to its expiry.
The Committee continues to believe that the remuneration policy ensures remuneration arrangements are aligned with the interests of our shareholders and current best practice whilst supporting the delivery of the Companys STEP 2020 Strategic Plan.
Market conditions remain challenging however the Committee firmly believes that the focus on LTIP opportunity appropriately incentivises the Executive Directors and aligns with the delivery of the STEP 2020 Strategic Plan.
In addition the shareholding requirement which was increased last year for the Chief Executive from 100% of salary to 200% of salary to reflect the increased LTIP award continues to align managements interests with those of shareholders.
The Committee believes that the total remuneration package is market competitive with companies of a similar size while avoiding worsening the Companys cash position through higher salaries andor bonuses.
The LTIP opportunity will only become payable if the minimum threshold EPS improvement target is delivered.
This is consistent with the Groups objective of delivering improving operating margins.
The Committee continues to focus on clear reporting of past remuneration and future policy.
We are also aware that the landscape for executive pay is changing and we will respond appropriately to changes and best practice as they develop.
I will be available at the AGM to answer any questions about the Committee and its work.
I would be pleased to welcome feedback from shareholders.

DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT
Directors Remuneration Policy
This section of the Directors Remuneration Report from pages 82 to 88 sets out the Companys policy for the remuneration of its
The application of the policy is set out in the next section on pages 89 to 94.
Following a review of remuneration carried out during the year ended 31 March 2016 the Directors Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders at the AGM on 20 July 2016 and took effect from that date.
The Directors Remuneration Policy will therefore apply for three years beginning on that date.
Remuneration principles for Executive Directors Our Directors Remuneration Policy has been designed to deliver two key aims which remain unchanged since the policy was first approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM To attract motivate and retain executives who will deliver high performance for all our stakeholders.
We believe the mix of our remuneration package provides an appropriate and balanced set of rewards.
Executive reward at Renold is relatively modest compared to our peer group and this has been validated by independent third parties.
This is consistent with the key Strategic Objective of lowering our breakeven point  this applies to executive pay as much as it does to any business expenditure.
However we are careful to ensure appropriate incentive opportunities remain for sustainable improvements in business performance.
To ensure a close alignment of executive pay to the Companys Strategic Objectives and performance.
We review our incentive plans each year to ensure they remain closely aligned with the Companys Strategic Objectives and shareholders interests while continuing to motivate and engage the Executive team to achieve stretching targets.
In addition we aim to make the remuneration framework for Executive Directors relatively simple  the incentive plans are therefore limited to an annual bonus and the PSP.
Policy table Based on our view of current market practice and the principles of our remuneration policy we have established the remuneration policy set out in this report.
The following table summarises the fixed and variable elements of remuneration for the Executive
Purpose and link to corporate strategy Operation of the element Maximum potential value and payment at thresholdreview basis Performance metrics Base salary Competitive salaries to attract retain and motivate those responsible for executing strategy while ensuring the Company pays no more than is necessary.
Paid in 12 equal monthly instalments during the year.
The policy is to provide fourth quartile base salary for comparable jobs in manufacturing companies of a similar size influenced by Role experience and performance Changes in broader workforce salary and Salaries payable in similar companies.
Reviewed annually and typically set on 1 August each year.
Annual rate for each Executive Director is set out in the Annual
Report on Remuneration.
Salaries have been frozen for a number of years and this will continue compared to modest inflation linked increases for the wider employee population.
Higher increases may be awarded following recruitment into a role at a belowmarket rate until the individual is aligned with market levels or due to a change in role or responsibilities.

The Committee may change the benefits offered in line with local market practice or business needs.
Car benefit is reviewed annually and set on 1 August each year to a maximum of 11000 per annum cash allowance or equivalent lease value.
The maximum opportunity for other benefits is defined by the nature of the benefit itself and the cost of providing it.
As the cost of providing such insurance benefits varies according to premium rates and the cost of other benefits is dependent on market rates and other factors there is no formal maximum monetary value.
None.
Pension
As base salary above.
The Executive Directors are not members of the Company pension scheme and have their own pension arrangements.
The Company makes pension provision in the form of annual contributions to personal pension arrangements or cash supplements in lieu of pension.

Annual bonus To incentivise delivery of the corporate strategy and reward delivery of superior performance.
Bonuses are not pensionable.
Annual bonuses are paid shortly after the end of the financial year end to which they relate.
Bonuses are normally payable in cash but the Committee has flexibility to introduce a share based deferral if deemed appropriate.
Maximum bonus payments are made only on the achievement of outstanding performance.
Performance targets are set at the start of the financial year and the level of bonus paid is determined by the Committee after the year end based on performance against target.
Part or all of the cash bonus may be forfeited or clawed back should exceptional circumstances occur.
Such circumstances would include fraud misconduct significant misstatement of financial results or incorrect calculation of performance conditions.
Maximum annual bonus payable is 100% of base salary.
No bonuses will be payable unless a minimum level of financial performance has been achieved.
Threshold performance results in nil bonus being awarded and ontarget performance results in up to 50% of the maximum bonus being awarded.
The bonus may be based on a range of financial non financial and personal targets as set by the Committee from year to year.
Financial targets will comprise at least half of the bonus.
Details of the targets will be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration following the end of each financial year.
The Committee has the right to exercise its discretion fairly and reasonably in assessing the bonus outcome including making adjustments for exceptional events occurring during the year.
The Committee has the discretion to vary the performance metrics over the life of this policy.

DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT
Directors Remuneration Policy Purpose and link to corporate strategy Operation of the element Maximum potential value and payment at thresholdreview basis Performance metrics
To incentivise delivery of long term shareholder value.
Key features of the PSP are Conditional share awards or nilcost options.
Outstanding commitments to issue new shares under all share plans are subject to a maximum of 10% of the Companys issued share capital in any ten year period.
The PSP includes the ability to grant options under an HM Revenue and Customs approved schedule.
Part or the whole of the PSP award can be recovered prior to vesting should exceptional circumstances occur.
Such circumstances would include fraud misconduct significant misstatement of financial results or incorrect calculation of performance conditions.
A maximum annual grant is permitted of 200% of base salary each year.
Vesting is dependent on performance conditions.
On achievement of threshold performance 25% of the award vests.
For the Chief Executive there is an absolute TSR condition that will account for 50% of the total award.
The adjusted EPS minimum targets will be a threshold trigger for the TSR condition to be measured.
The performance condition for the Group Finance Director is based on growth in adjusted EPS which must be met over a three year period.
In exceptional circumstances the Committee has discretion to change the performance measures targets and weightings between measures during the performance period if there is a significant event which causes the Committee to believe that the original conditions are no longer appropriate.
Any amendments would be such that the new conditions are not materially less difficult to satisfy than the original conditions.
The Committee also has discretion to reduce the percentage that vests in cases where it believes the outcome of the performance conditions is not a fair reflection of the Companys performance.
Shareholding requirement To strengthen the alignment between the interests of Executive Directors and those of shareholders.
Executive Directors have five years to build the minimum holding.
Unvested PSP or deferred shares are not taken into account.
Share price is measured at the end of each financial year.
All PSP or deferred share awards vesting net of income tax and National Insurance contributions must be retained until the shareholding requirement is met.
Chief Executive  200% of base salary.
Other Executive Directors  100% of base salary.

DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT
Directors Remuneration Policy Shareholder views The Committee constantly welcomes the views of shareholders in respect of pay policy as well as those views expressed on behalf of shareholders by their respective proxy advisers.
The
Committee documents all remuneration related comments made at the Companys AGM and feedback received during consultation with shareholders throughout the year.
Any feedback received is fully considered by the Committee and amendments made to remuneration policy where thought necessary.
Discretion of the Committee The Committee has discretion in various areas of policy as set out in this report.
The Committee may also exercise operational and administrative discretions under relevant plan rules approved by shareholders as set out in those rules.
In addition the Committee has the discretion to amend the implementation of policy with regard to minor or administrative matters where it would be in the opinion of the Committee disproportionate to seek or await shareholder approval.
Differences in remuneration policy for all employees All employees of the Group are entitled to base salary and benefits.
The Group operates a number of pension plans for employees which it operates in line with local market practice.
Some employees in senior roles are entitled to participate in an annual bonus scheme.
The maximum opportunity available is based on the seniority and responsibility of the role.
Conditional share awards or nilcost options are only available to senior executives and Executive Directors.
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group The Committee invites the Group HR Director to present at a meeting on the proposals for salary increases for the employee population generally and on any other changes to remuneration policy within the Group.
The Committee has frozen any salary increases for Executive Directors which is therefore lower than the increases available to employees.
The Group HR Director consults with the Committee on the performance metrics for Executive Directors bonuses and to the extent to which these should be cascaded to other employees.
The
Committee approves the overall annual bonus cost to the Group each year.
The Committee has oversight over the grant of all PSP awards across the Group.
The Group does not specifically invite employees to comment on the Directors Remuneration Policy but any comments made by employees are taken into account.
The Committee is provided with data on the remuneration structure for senior management in the three tiers below Executive Director and uses this information to work with the human resources team to ensure consistency of approach throughout the Group.
Total remuneration opportunity The chart below demonstrates the total amount of remuneration payable to the Chief Executive Robert Purcell and Group Finance Director Ian Scapens under the proposed remuneration policy for the year ending 31 March 2018 should they achieve minimum ontarget or maximum performance.
The amounts shown represent 000s and for share related elements are the face value of awards.
The chart shows that at minimum levels of performance the Executive Directors only form of remuneration is the fixed element of base pay benefits in kind and pension contributions.
The Executive Directors base salaries are assessed independently of the ability to earn variable awards under the annual and long term incentive plans and hence future bonus opportunities are not a consideration when setting base pay.

In the event of early termination the Companys policy is to act fairly in all circumstances.
The Committee has noted the Association of British Insurers and National Association of Pension Funds joint statement on Executive Contracts and
None of the Executive Directors contracts provide for compensation in the event of a change of control of the Company.
Copies of the service contracts are available for inspection by shareholders at the Companys registered office.
Change of control In the event of a change of control any outstanding awards under the PSP may vest.
Awards will become exercisable immediately.
The proportion of award vesting will be determined by the Committee based on the proportion of the performance period completed and the extent to which the performance condition has been met at the date the change of control occurs.
The Committee has discretion to waive any performance condition if it considers this appropriate in the particular circumstances.
Leavers
The Committees policy for exit payments on a leaver event involving an Executive Director is Item Policy Details Salary pension and benefits A maximum of 12 months salary pension and benefits may be payable.
Payments may be subject to mitigation if the leaver finds alternative employment.
Annual bonus No annual bonus normally payable unless the Committee uses its discretion to treat as a good leaver.
Good leavers are entitled to receive a bonus based on performance to date of termination prorated for the period of service to termination.
PSP The Committee will use its discretion to determine whether the individual should be treated as a good leaver or a bad leaver.
In the event of death retirement illhealth or disability an individual will be treated as a good leaver.
Bad leavers will forfeit outstanding PSP awards.
Good leavers awards shall ordinarily vest at the normal vesting date prorata based on the proportion of the vesting period completed and based on the extent to which the performance condition has been met.
In the event of death awards vest immediately subject to time prorating and assessment of performance.
The Committee has discretion to accelerate vesting to date of cessation for other good leavers.
Awards may be exercised within a six month period following date of leaving or vesting if later.
In the case of death the award may be exercised within a 12 month period following death.
In determining whether an individual should be treated as a good leaver or a bad leaver and in assessing the extent to which any award will vest the Committee will consider the specific circumstances of the departure the individuals performance prior to departure and the performance of the Company.

DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT
Directors Remuneration Policy Approach to recruitment remuneration In the event of the appointment of a new Director the same principles would apply as they do today to the existing Directors.
The remuneration package of any new Executive Director would therefore include the elements and maximum award size set out on pages 82 to 85 in accordance with the Companys remuneration policy and be subject to the same discretions.
The Committees approach to recruitment remuneration is to set the base salary level in accordance with the remuneration policy and having taken into account the individuals experience the nature of the role and their existing remuneration package.
Where it is necessary to buy out an individuals awards from a previous employer the Committee will seek to match the value timing of vesting and type of these awards with replacement awards.
Any buy out awards would be an additional element of remuneration to the normal maxima as set out in the Policy table on pages 82 to 85.
Details of the Companys approach to the remuneration of NonExecutive Directors are set out below.
External NonExecutive Directorships The Board encourages Executive Directors to broaden their experience outside the Company by taking up a nonexecutive directorship.

Given the period since the last review a full review of the fees for NonExecutive Directors will be undertaken by the Board during the financial year ending 31 March 2018 the results of that review will be reported in the 2018 Directors Remuneration Report.
The letters of appointment for each of the NonExecutive Directors confirm that their appointment is for a specified term and that reappointment is not automatic.
When making a decision on reappointment the Board reviews the NonExecutive Directors attendance and performance at meetings and the composition and skill of the Board as a whole.
Each NonExecutive Director is appointed for an initial period of three years subject to earlier termination by either party.
Thereafter the appointment may be renewed provided that both the NonExecutive Director and the Board agree.
Their respective appointments continue on an annual basis subject to reelection at each

2 Variable elements of pay  awards vested in year i Annual bonus payable in cash The annual bonus which is payable in cash provides the Executive Directors with the opportunity to receive an annual bonus of up to 100% of base salary on achievement of adjusted EBITDA and average net debt targets.
For the year ended 31 March 2017 the annual bonus targets for Executive Directors were based upon the matrix below.
Average Net Debt m Adjusted EBITDA m 29.8 29.3 28.8 28.5 28.3 22.7  10.0% 20.0% 30.0% 40.0% 23.1 20.0% 30.0% 40.0% 50.0% 60.0% 23.5 40.0% 50.0% 60.0% 70.0% 80.0% 23.9 60.0% 70.0% 80.0% 90.0% 95.0% 24.3 70.0% 80.0% 90.0% 95.0% 100.0% Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest tax depreciation amortisation closed defined benefit pension scheme charges and exceptional items.
Average net debt is the net sum of external borrowings finance leases and cash and cash equivalents measured at each month end to produce a simple annual average.

The two metrics shown were structured as a matrix such that failure to deliver a minimum result in either metric led to no bonus being achievable in the other.
Similarly in order to achieve the maximum award superior performance would be required against both metrics.
For the year ended 31 March 2017 the Adjusted EBITDA for the year was 20.3m and the Average Net Debt was 30.4m measured at budget exchange rates in accordance with the annual bonus rules.
As both metrics were below the threshold targets no bonus was payable.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT
The carrying value of inventory Risk description As shown in Note 11 the Group holds inventory of 40.4m 201636.3m.
As discussed on page 72 management judgement is applied to the cost of inventories in order to accurately reflect the manufacturing costs incurred in bringing them to their current condition and physical location.
This primarily relates to the assessment of direct labour costs incurred manufacturing overheads to be absorbed and other relevant production costs.
A risk surrounding the carrying value of inventory when compared to the net realisable value as a result of inadequate provisioning has also been identified.
Establishing a provision for slowmoving obsolete and damaged inventory involves estimates and judgements taking into account forecast sales and historical usage information.
How the scope of our audit responded to the risk We evaluated the design and implementation of key controls relating to the assessment of inventory valuation and inventory provisioning On a sample basis we have performed the following audit procedures Agreed the cost of raw materials to third party supplier invoices For work in progress and finished goods we obtained the bill of material and tested the underlying costs within each stock item.
We challenged the key assumptions concerning overhead absorption by assessing the appropriateness of costs included in the calculation Reviewed the overheads absorbed to determine whether they were allowable under IAS 2 and appropriately recognised.
We agreed the estimated overheads to actual overheads incurred in the year to assess whether they were materially different Assessed the net realisable value NRV on a sample basis of stock items by agreeing their subsequent sales price to customer invoices to ensure that the items were being held at the lower of cost and NRV Gained an understanding of the movements in the inventory provision year on year and an assessment of the scale of the provision in comparison to the gross stock value to determine whether there are any unusual transactions Recalculated the value of the provision based on a sample of items and Where manual adjustments have been made to the provision we have understood these by gaining supporting documentation.
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets Risk description The goodwill 26.4m 2016 22.7m and intangible assets 9.7m 2016 10.3m balance shown in Note 7 principally relates to Jeffrey Chain and are supported by an annual impairment review.
Other intangibles as shown in Note 8 amount to 9.7m comprising largely of computer software of 6.5m 2016 6.1m.
As discussed on page 72 the risk identified is in respect of Managements judgements in relation to the financial forecasts of the business units discount rates and perpetuity growth rates used to determine the value in use of the cash generating units which are subjective and could lead to an impairment charge if incorrect.
How the scope of our audit responded to the risk We assessed the design and implementation of key controls concerning managements impairment review process We have evaluated the future cash flow forecasts and the process by which they are drawn up including confirming the accuracy of the underlying calculations and checking whether the forecasts are consistent with the latest Board approved forecasts We assessed the historical accuracy of managements budgets and forecasts by comparing them to actual performance and verifying the mathematical accuracy of the cash flow models We utilised our specialists to assess the appropriateness of the discount rate derived from a Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC applied by management in their discounted cash flows We challenged the underlying assumptions and significant judgements used in managements impairment model by examining the results of managements sensitivity analysis around longterm growth rates and discount rates to ascertain the extent of change in those assumptions that would be required for an impairment to be recognised and We also assessed whether the disclosures in the accounting policies of the financial statements appropriately disclose the key judgements taken so that the reader of the financial statements is aware of the impact of the financial statement of changes to key assumptions that may lead to impairment.

104 672017 30341 PM 2529004 AR 2017 Proof 3 Defined benefit pension scheme accounting Risk description The Group have a number of defined benefit pension schemes that are in a net deficit position of 102.0m as shown in Note 18 which is significant both in the context of the overall balance sheet and the results of the Group.
As described on page 72 the valuation of the pension liability requires significant levels of judgement and technical expertise in choosing appropriate assumptions a number of which can be volatile.
Changes in the number of the key assumptions including salary increases inflation discount rates and mortality can have a material impact on the calculation of the liability.
How the scope of our audit responded to the risk We assessed the design and implementation of key controls concerning managements valuation process We challenged the discount rate and inflation rates used in the valuation of the pensions liabilities by comparison to our internally developed expectations using our actuarial expertise and compared the assumptions around salary increases and mortality to national and industry averages and We evaluated the sensitivity of the pension scheme deficits to differences between our independent judgements and those made by the Directors both individually and in aggregate.
Deferred tax asset recognition Risk description The Group has a net deferred tax asset DTA of 20.6m 2016 16.7m and an unrecognised DTA of 26.2m 2016 IAS 12 states that a DTA shall be recognised for the carry forward of unused tax losses and unused tax credits to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses and unused tax credits can be utilised.
As described on page 72 the key judgement in this area is that there will be sufficient future taxable profits available against which the unused tax losses and future pension deductions can be utilised.
How the scope of our audit responded to the risk We evaluated the design and implementation of key controls relating to the assessment of the future profitability of the Group We challenged managements assumptions used in the forecast model by using our knowledge of the Group and the industry in which it operates In assessing Managements judgements we have considered amongst other things historical levels of taxable profits the historical accuracy of forecasts and the growth forecasts used by the Group.
This included critically assessing the assumptions and judgements made by the Directors in those growth forecasts by using our knowledge of the Group and the industry in which it operates We used our own tax specialists to assist in assessing and challenging the assumptions and judgements made by the Directors and We also assessed the adequacy of the Groups disclosures setting out the basis of the deferred tax balance and the level of estimation involved.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Our application of materiality We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced.
We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
Based on our professional judgement we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows Group materiality 455000 2016 480000 Basis for determining materiality 5% of adjusted pretax profit as defined on page 108 was the basis for which materiality was determined which is consistent with the prior year.
Pretax profit has been adjusted for exceptional items of 1.7m 2016 2.2m which are considered to be oneoff in nature as per Note 2c.
Rationale for the benchmark applied We have used adjusted pretax profit as we deem this an appropriate benchmark which better reflects the underlying performance of the business and reduces the risk of volatility.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of 23000 2016 20500 as well as differences below that threshold that in our view warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
The change in the reporting threshold has been made following our reassessment of what matters require communicating.
We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment including Groupwide controls and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level.
Based on that assessment we focused our Group audit scope primarily on the audit work at 14 locations 2016 14 locations.
7 2016 7 of these were subject to a full audit 5 2016 5 were subject to an audit of specified account balances where the extent of our testing was based on our assessment of the risks of material misstatement and of the materiality of the Groups operations at those locations.
The remaining 2 2016 2 were subject to review procedures.
These 14 locations represent the principal business units and account for 100% 2016 100% of the Groups revenue.
They were also selected to provide an appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement identified above.
Our audit work at the 14 locations was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity which were lower than Group materiality and ranged from 225000 to 247500.
At the Parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject to audit or audit of specified account balances.
The Group audit team follow a programme of planned visits that has been designed so that a senior member of the Group audit team visits each of the locations where the Group audit scope was focused at least once every two years and the most significant of them at least once a year.
In years when we do not visit a significant component we will include the component audit team in our team briefing discuss their risk assessment and review documentation of the findings from their work.
During the current year audit a senior member of the Group audit team visited two locations in the US and Germany.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 In our opinion based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit the part of the Directors Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements and the Strategic Report and the Directors Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

Basis of preparation Statement of compliance Renold plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The Companys financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about the Group.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the
In addition the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to groups reporting under IFRS.
The Parent Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with FRS 101 these are presented on pages 147 to 155.
The financial statements were approved by the Board on 30 May 2017.
Basis of accounting The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except where otherwise indicated.
The accounting policies as set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
Functional and presentation currency These consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling which is the Groups functional currency.
Foreign currency translation Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction or average rates where applicable.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement except for monetary items that form part of the net investment in foreign operations which are taken to other comprehensive income.
Assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries are translated into Pounds Sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the end of the financial year.
Income statements and cash flows are translated at the appropriate average rates of exchange for the year.
Differences on exchange arising on the retranslation of net assets in overseas subsidiaries borrowings used to finance or provide a hedge against those investments and from the translation of the results at average rates are taken directly to other comprehensive income.
On loss of control of a foreign entity related exchange differences previously recognised in other comprehensive income are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and the entities controlled by the Company made up to 31 March each year.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred the liabilities incurred and equity interests issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquired entity.
Consideration transferred also includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement.
Acquisition related costs are expensed in operating costs as incurred.
All identifiable assets and liabilities acquired and contingent liabilities assumed are initially measured at their fair values at the acquisition date.
The excess of the consideration transferred the amount of any noncontrolling interest and the acquisition date fair value of any previously held equity interest in the acquired entity as compared with the Groups share of the identifiable net assets are recognised as goodwill.
Where the Groups share of identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the total consideration transferred a gain from a bargain purchase is recognised immediately in the income statement after the fair values initially determined have been reassessed.
Subsidiaries are entities that are controlled by the Group.
Control is exerted where the Group has the power to govern directly or indirectly the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain economic benefits from its activities.
Typically a shareholding of more than 50% of the voting rights is indicative of control.
However the impact of potential voting rights currently exercisable is taken into consideration.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements of the Group from the date that control is obtained to the date that control ceases.
The accounting policies of new subsidiaries are changed where necessary to align them with those of the Group.
Noncontrolling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups equity therein.
They are initially measured at the noncontrolling interests share of the net fair value of the assets and liabilities recognised or at fair value as determined on an acquisition by acquisition basis.
Subsequent to acquisition noncontrolling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the noncontrolling interests share of the changes in equity since the date of the combination.
Renold plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 for the year ended 31 March 2017 Renold AR2017Proof3.
112 672017 30343 PM 2529004 AR 2017 Proof 3 The results and financial position of Renold Scottish Limited Partnership SLP have been consolidated in the consolidated financial statements of Renold plc.
Renold plc is the parent undertaking of the general partner in the SLP see Note xiv to the Company financial statements.
To determine that Renold plc has control over the SLP we considered the following activities benefits and risks Activities  The SLP was established by Renold plc as a means of funding its pension obligation in an efficient manner.
Benefits  During the 25 year period the Renold Pension Scheme will receive substantially all of the SLPs income.
However after this period the Renold Group is entitled to any remaining income generated in the SLP together with any other residual value in the SLP.
Risks  The Group bears the risks incidental to the activities of the SLP because it retains the obligation to ensure the pension scheme is appropriately funded.
Accordingly advantage has been taken of the exemption conferred by paragraph 7 of the Partnerships Accounts Regulations 2008 from the requirements for preparation delivery and publication of the partnerships accounts.
Intragroup balances and transactions and any unrealised income and expense arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity accounted investments are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in that investment.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Going concern The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
In determining the appropriate basis of preparation of the financial statements the Directors are required to consider whether the Group can continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Further information in relation to the Groups business activities together with the factors likely to affect its future development performance and position is set out in the Strategic Report on pages 8 to 55.
The financial position of the Group its cash flows liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Strategic Report on pages 8 to 55.
In addition Note 25 to the financial statements includes the Groups objectives policies and processes for managing its capital its financial risk management objectives details of its financial instruments and hedging activities and its exposure to foreign exchange credit and interest rate risk.
Further details of the Groups cash balances and borrowings are included in Notes 13 14 and 25 of the financial statements.
There were no significant post balance sheet events to report see Note 26.
The Directors have assessed the future funding requirements of the Group and the Company and compared them to the level of available borrowing facilities.
The assessment included a detailed review of financial and cash flow forecasts financial instruments and hedging arrangements for at least the 12 month period from the date of signing the Annual Report and Accounts.
The Directors considered a range of potential scenarios within the key markets the Group serves and how these might impact the Groups cash flow facility headroom and banking covenants.
The Directors also considered what mitigating actions the Group could take to limit any adverse consequences.
The Groups forecasts and projections show that the Group should be able to operate within the level of its borrowing facilities and covenants.
Having undertaken this work the Directors are of the opinion that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Revenue
Revenue comprises the invoiced value for the sale of goods net of sales rebates discounts VAT and other sales related taxes and after eliminating sales within the Group.
Revenue is recognised when the outcome of a transaction can be measured reliably and when it is probable that the economic benefits from the transaction will flow to the Group.
Revenue is recognised on the following basis a Sale of goods Revenue is recognised on the sale of goods when the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred from the Group to the customer.
This is normally the point of despatch to the customer when title passes.
These comprise customer discounts and rebates which are sales incentives to customers to encourage them to purchase increased volumes and are related to total volumes purchased and sales growth or incentives for early payment.
They are recognised in the same period as the sales to which they relate based upon managements best estimate of the amount necessary to meet claims made by the Groups customers in respect of these rebates and discounts.
These comprise rebates and discounts received from suppliers as incentives to purchase increased volume or early settlement of amounts payable.
They are recognised within operating costs over the period to which the contract or purchase relates.

113 672017 30343 PM 2529004 AR 2017 Proof 3 Significant accounting judgements estimates and assumptions The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
However uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that could require a material adjustment to the carrying value of the Groups assets or liabilities in the future.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a potential risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are as follows a Impairment of nonfinancial assets The Group assesses whether there are any indicators of impairment for all nonfinancial assets at each reporting date.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and at other times when such indicators exist.
When value in use calculations are undertaken management must estimate the expected future cash flows from the asset or cash generating unit and choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the net present value of those cash flows.
Further details are included in Note 7.
Deferred tax assets in respect of pension liabilities are recognised in full with the exception of Germany where the amount recognised is offset by a deferred tax liability in relation to the German tax base of the pension liability given the business has a legal obligation to make the underlying pension contributions and it is probable that adequate taxable profit will be available to take advantage of the associated taxable deductions.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the losses can be utilised.
Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised based upon the likely timing and level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies.
Actual outcomes may vary which could require a material adjustment to the carrying amounts.
Further details are contained in Note 17.
The valuation of the Groups defined benefit plans are determined by using actuarial valuations.
These involve making assumptions about discount rates future salary increases mortality rates and future pension increases.
Due to the longterm nature of these plans such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty.
Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability.
Further details are given in Note 18.
The Group has assessed an existing operating lease obligation at the Bredbury facility and concluded that an onerous lease provision is required following the cessation of significant manufacturing activity at the site.
This involves making assumptions upon future sublet income streams and the discount rate used.
An additional onerous lease provision was created in the year following the sale and leaseback of the Australian Mulgrave facility.
For further details refer to Notes 2c and 16.
Manufactured inventory and work in progress include amounts of attributable indirect costs incurred in the production process.
The
Group employs a standard cost methodology which while including judgements and assumptions seeks to allocate the allowable indirect production costs in a logical and appropriate manner.
Adoption of new and revised standards i New and revised accounting standards adopted by the Group During the year the Group has adopted the following new and revised standards and interpretations.
Their adoption has not had any significant impact on the amounts or disclosures reported in these financial statements.
IAS 1 amended Presentation of Financial Statements.
The amendment addresses perceived impediments to preparers exercising their judgement in presenting their financial reports.
IAS 16 amended Property Plant and Equipment.
This amendment clarifies that depreciation methods based on revenue are inappropriate and adds guidance that expected future reductions in the selling price of an item produced using an asset could indicate the expectation of technological or commercial obsolescence which in turn might reflect a reduction of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset.
IAS 19 amended Employee Benefits.
As part of the 20122014 cycle of the Annual Improvements Project this standard was amended to clarify that the high quality corporate bonds used in estimating the discount rate for postemployment benefits should be denominated in the same currency as the benefits to be paid.
IAS 27 revised Separate Financial Statements.
This revision introduces new disclosure requirements for investment entities.
IAS 28 amended Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures This amendment clarifies that when applying the equity method to an associate or a joint venture a noninvestment entity investor in an investment entity may retain the fair value measurement applied by the associate or joint venture to its interests in subsidiaries.
IAS 38 amended Intangible Assets.
This amendment clarifies that amortisation methods based on revenue are inappropriate except in limited circumstances.
IFRS 5 amended Noncurrent Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.
As part of the 20122014 cycle of the Annual Improvements Project this standard was amended to add specific guidance for cases in which an entity reclassifies an asset from held for sale to held for distribution or vice versa and cases in which held for distribution accounting is discontinued.

114 672017 30343 PM 2529004 AR 2017 Proof 3 IFRS 7 amended Financial Instruments Disclosures.
As part of the 20122014 cycle of the Annual Improvements Project this standard was amended to clarify whether a servicing contract is continuing involvement in a transferred asset and clarification on offsetting disclosures in condensed interim financial statements.
IFRS 10 amended Consolidated Financial Statements.
This amendment clarifies the exemptions from preparing consolidated financial statements for a parent entity that is a subsidiary of an investment entity.
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements.
This standard establishes the principles for financial reporting by entities that have an interest in arrangements that are controlled jointly.
IFRS 12 amended Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities.
This amendment clarifies that a subsidiary that provides services related to the parents investment activities should not be consolidated if the subsidiary is an investment entity.
In addition the amendment clarifies that an investment entity measuring all of its subsidiaries at fair value should provide the disclosures relating to investment entities.
At the date of publishing these financial statements the following new and revised standards and interpretations were in issue but were not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU.
None of these new and revised standards and interpretations have been adopted early by the Group Annual improvements 20122014 cycle Annual improvements 20142016 cycle IAS 7 amended Statement of Cash Flows IAS 12 amended Income Taxes IFRS 2 Sharebased Payment IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 16 amended Leases IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance
The Directors are in the process of assessing the potential impact of IFRS 15 on both revenue recognition and disclosure requirements and the impact of IFRS 16 on liability recognition and disclosure requirements.
With the exception of IFRS 15 and 16 the Directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group in future periods.

115 672017 30343 PM 2529004 AR 2017 Proof 3 Segmental information For management purposes the Group is organised into two operating segments according to the nature of their products and services and these are considered by the Directors to be the reportable operating segments of Renold plc as shown below The Chain segment manufactures and sells power transmission and conveyor chain and also includes sales of torque transmission products through Chain National Sales Companies NSCs and The Torque Transmission segment manufactures and sells torque transmission products such as gearboxes and couplings.
No operating segments have been aggregated to form the above reportable segments.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM for the purposes of IFRS 8 Operating Segments is considered to be the Board of Directors of Renold plc.
Management monitor the results of the separate reportable operating segments based on operating profit and loss which is measured consistently with operating profit and loss in the consolidated financial statements.
The same segmental basis applies to decisions about resource allocation.
Disclosure has not been included in respect of the operating assets of each segment as they are not reported to the CODM on a regular basis.
However Group net financing costs retirement benefit obligations and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and therefore are not allocated to operating segments.
Transfer prices between operating segments are on an arms length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.

116 672017 30343 PM 2529004 AR 2017 Proof 3 Segmental information continued The Group uses a variety of alternative performance measures which are nonIFRS to assess the performance of its operations.
The
Group considers these performance measures to provide useful historical financial information to help investors evaluate the underlying performance of the business by adjusting for volatility created by oneoff items and nontrading performance related costs such as amortisation and legacy pensions costs.
The two consistently applied performance measures which are disclosed within this annual report and accounts include adjusted results and underlying results.
Adjusted results exclude the impact of exceptional items pension financing charges pension administration costs and the amortisation of acquired intangible assets and the tax thereon.
A reconciliation of these results is shown on the face of the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and in the tables opposite.
Adjusted profit of 14.5m is derived from the statutory profit of 11.0m.
Underlying results are retranslated to current year exchange rates and therefore only prior year comparatives would be deemed an alternative performance measure.
A reconciliation is provided below.

Costs of 0.3m were incurred until migration was completed in December 2016 and have now ceased.
Various restructuring costs were incurred in the year as part of the STEP 2020 Strategic Plan.
The European distribution and sales operations were relocated with the sales functions transferred to a nearby rented office in Lille France and the European distribution operations moved to a new warehouse in Uslar Germany located close to the Einbeck Chain manufacturing factory.
These moves resulted in redundancy and restructuring costs of 0.6m.
The former European distribution site at Seclin France was sold for 1.0m resulting in no gain or loss on disposal following the 0.5m impairment charge incurred in the prior year.
Also in the year redundancy and restructuring costs of 2.5m were incurred transferring the HiTec Couplings business located in Halifax to our existing Couplings facility in Cardiff.
As a result of this transfer the Halifax property is now held for sale at a value of 0.3m sold on 15 May 2017  see Note 10.
The increased manufacturing capability at the Cardiff site permitted the closure of the China Couplings facility with manufacturing moving to Cardiff and South Africa.
This incurred redundancy and restructuring costs of 0.6m in the year.
A further restructuring cost of 0.4m was incurred in the year as we commenced a multiyear project to transfer the China Chain manufacturing facility from leased premises in Hangzhou to a purposebuilt facility near Changzhou in Jiangsu province.
Other
In March 2017 the Mulgrave manufacturing facility in Australia was sold realising net proceeds of 9.3m resulting in a gain on disposal net of associated costs of 2.9m.
As part of the sale agreement Renold can remain as a tenant and retain full use of the property for three years until March 2020 at which point the property must be vacated.
Prior year restructuring costs included 0.5m incurred at the Milnrow facility where the business was downsized following the end of a longterm supply agreement offshored by the customer 0.6m of costs related to the relocation of the head office and 1.4m of other STEP 2020 restructuring costs incurred in the year.
Also in the prior year a past service credit of 1.3m arose in Germany following the confirmation that the pension scheme was properly closed to future accrual with effect from 2014.
This was offset by a 0.1m settlement loss relating to the liquidation of the Australian pension scheme.

Accounting Policy The tax charge included in the income statement comprises current tax payable and deferred tax.
The Group is subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions.
The current tax charge represents an estimate of the amounts payable to tax authorities in respect of taxable profits.
It is based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method providing for temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
The amount of deferred tax provided is calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised or taxable profit will be available against which unused tax losses can be utilised before they expire.
Deferred income tax relating to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income and not the income statement.
Similarly income tax is charged or credited to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged directly to equity.
Otherwise income tax is recognised in the income statement.
Deferred tax balances are analysed in Note 17.

This change was substantively enacted in September 2016.
Accordingly deferred tax balances have been revalued to the lower rate of 17% in these financial statements which has resulted in a 0.5m deferred tax charge to the statement of other comprehensive income.
The Groups tax charge in future years will be affected by the profit mix effective tax rates in the different countries where the Group operates and utilisation of tax losses.

Accounting Policy i Initial recognition Goodwill arises on business combinations and represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the Groups share of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree at the acquisition date.
Where the cost is less than the Groups share of the identifiable net assets the difference is immediately recognised in the income statement as a gain from a bargain purchase.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
In respect of equity accounted investments goodwill acquired directly is included in the carrying amount of the investment.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested at least annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.
The cash generating units to which the goodwill has been allocated is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets.
Any impairment charge is recognised immediately in the income statement.

The recoverable amount of each Cash Generating Unit CGU has been determined on a value in use basis.
Value in use is calculated as the net present value of cash flows derived from detailed financial plans for the next two financial years as approved by the Board.
Cash flows beyond this are extrapolated using the longterm country growth rates disclosed below Growth rates CGU discount rates Carrying values % % % % Jeffrey Chain USA 1.6 2.1 16.2 12.4 23.2 20.2 Ace Chains Australia 2.8 2.9 10.3 13.2 0.5 0.5 Renold Chain India 8.1 7.7 30.1 30.5 2.2 1.8 Renold Tooth Chain Germany 1.2  12.8  0.5 0.2 site Stock code RNO FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS Renold AR2017Proof3.
123 672017 30344 PM 2529004 AR 2017 Proof 3 Goodwill continued Key assumptions used in the value in use calculations Sales volumes selling prices and cost changes The Group prepares cash flow forecasts based on the latest management estimates for the next two financial years.
The expected sales prices and volumes reflect managements experience of how sales will develop at this point of the economic cycle.
The expected profit margin reflects managements experience of each CGUs profitability at the forecast level of sales and incorporates the impact of any restructuring that took place during the year ended 31 March 2017.
Cash flows beyond the period of projections are extrapolated using longterm growth rates published by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development for the territory in which the CGU is based.
The discount rates applied to the cash flows of each of the CGUs are based on the risk free rate for longterm bonds issued by the government in the respective market.
This is then adjusted to reflect both the increased risk of investing in equities and the systematic risk of the specific CGU using an average of the betas of comparable companies.
Management believe that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions would cause the carrying values to materially exceed each CGUs recoverable amount.
Provisional fair value adjustment  Renold Tooth Chain During the year the provisional fair values calculated at the Tooth Chain acquisition date have been reassessed resulting in an adjustment to the provisional fair values of inventories 0.2m reduction and provisions 0.2m increase calculated at the date of acquisition.
Furthermore the contingent consideration paid in the year was lower than the provisional amount anticipated at the acquisition date These adjustments have been reflected in goodwill arising upon acquisition resulting in a 0.3m increase.
Intangible assets Accounting Policy i Computer software Computer software that is not integral to an item of plant and equipment is recognised separately as an intangible asset.
Amortisation is charged on a straightline basis so as to charge the cost of software to the income statement over its expected useful life which is between three and seven years.
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programs are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Other intangible assets such as those identified on acquisition by the Group that have finite useful lives are recognised at fair value and measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
The estimated useful lives for the Groups finite life intangible assets are between one and seven years.
Intangible assets are reviewed at least annually to ensure that assets are not carried above their recoverable amounts.
Where some indication of impairment exists calculations are made of the discounted cash flows resulting from continued use of the assets value in use or from their disposal fair value less costs to sell.
Where these values are less than the carrying amount of the assets an impairment loss is charged to the income statement.

Depreciation is calculated on a straightline basis so as to charge the depreciable amount of the respective assets to the income statement over their expected useful lives.
No depreciation has been charged on freehold land.
The useful lives of assets are as follows
Freehold buildings 50 Leasehold properties 50 years or the period of the lease if less General plant and equipment 15 Fixtures 15 Precision cutting and grinding machines 10 Motor vehicles 3 Useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually and where adjustments are required these are made prospectively.
Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable amount it is written down immediately to its recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amounts and are included in operating profit.
Tangible assets held under finance leases which are those where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed to the Group are capitalised in the balance sheet at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset or the present value of the minimum lease payments and are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term.
The corresponding liability to the leasing company net of finance charges is included as an obligation under finance leases in creditors.
The interest element of the lease payment is charged to the income statement on a basis which produces a constant rate of charge over the period of the liability.

Core banking facilities On 13 May 2015 the Group agreed a revision to its existing banking facilities with its current banking partners Svenska Handelsbanken AB and Lloyds Bank plc.
The revised facility replicates the previous 41m MultiCurrency Revolving Facility MCRF but also adds a 20m accordion feature that can be accessed by the Group to fund investment or acquisition opportunities.
The revised facility has been extended to mature in May 2020 whereas the original maturity was in October 2016.
The MCRF is fully committed and available until maturity.
At the year end the undrawn facility was 5.3m 2016 3.4m.
The Group pays interest at LIBOR plus a variable margin in respect of this facility.
The average rate of interest paid in the year was LIBOR plus 1.91% for Sterling denominated facility and LIBOR plus 1.82% for the Euro and US Dollar denominated facility 2016 LIBOR plus 1.79% for Sterling denominated facility and LIBOR plus 1.81% for the Euro and US Dollar denominated facility.
This facility has two primary financial covenants which are tested on a six monthly basis.
The first is net debt as a ratio of rolling annual EBITDA with a maximum ratio of 2.5 times.
The second is interest cover with a minimum ratio of 4.0 times rolling annual EBITDA divided by net financial interest cost.
The Group also benefits from a number of overseas facilities totalling 2.2m.
Secured borrowings Included in Group borrowings are secured borrowings of 32.3m 2016 35.0m.
Security is provided by fixed and floating charges over assets including certain property plant and equipment and inventory primarily in the UK USA France Germany and Australia.
Finance leases The Group has no obligations under finance leases.
Preference Stock At 31 March 2017 there were 580482 units of Preference Stock in issue 2016 580482.
All payments of dividends on the Preference Stock have been paid on the due dates.
The Preference Stock has the following rights a fixed cumulative preferential dividend at the rate of 6% per annum payable half yearly on 1 January and 1 July in each year ii rank both with regard to dividend including any arrears on the commencement of a winding up and return of capital in priority to all other stock or shares in the Company but with no further right to participate in profits or assets iii no right to attend or vote either in person or by proxy at any general meeting of the Company or to have notice of any such meeting unless the dividend on the Preference Stock is in arrears for six calendar months and iv no redemption entitlement and no fixed repayment date.

Onerous lease This provision relates to onerous lease costs in respect of the lease of the Bredbury plant in the UK and the Mulgrave facility in Australia.
The Bredbury lease expires in May 2030.
A lease was agreed in August 2016 to sublet a significant part of the property for a five year term for an annual rent of 0.6m.
0.9m of the provision was utilised in the year leaving a provision of 3.2m in respect of this lease.
In addition as part of the sale agreement of the Mulgrave facility in Australia completed in March 2017 it was agreed that the business could remain in the property for a maximum of three additional years for an annual rent of 0.5m.
This lease was deemed to be onerous and as a result a provision was established in relation to the total lease cost of 1.6m.
This charge was included in the net exceptional gain on the sale of the property of 2.9m see Note 2c.

The first year target resulted in consideration of 0.5m 0.6m becoming payable.
This was paid in April 2017.
The reduction has been adjusted though goodwill see Note 7.
Management expect that the second year target will be met and therefore the amount has been provided in full.
Deferred tax Accounting Policy The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current income tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable authority and taxable entity or where deferred tax relates to different taxable entities the tax authority permits the Group to make a single net payment.

Accelerated capital allowances 0.2  0.1  0.3 During the year the Group has reported an adjusted operating profit of 14.5m 2016 14.2m.
The businesses in all jurisdictions where deferred tax assets have been recognised will more likely than not generate suitable profits based on approved management forecasts from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets amount to 26.2m 2016 21.7m arising from unrecognised losses of 20.7m 2016 14.5m representing losses of 83.2m 2016 52.3m and other timing differences of 5.5m 2016 7.2m.
Based on available evidence it is considered unlikely that these amounts will be recovered within the foreseeable future.
The significant majority of these losses are not subject to time limits.
Pensions
Accounting Policy The Group operates a number of defined benefit plans around the world.
The costs are calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
Any past service costs resulting from enhanced benefits are recognised immediately in the income statement as a normal operating cost.
Administration costs including the Pensions Protection Levy are charged to operating costs.
However plan asset management costs are included in the actual return on plan assets.
Remeasurement gains and losses comprising actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets excluding amounts included in net interest are recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Actuarial gains and losses arise when actual results differ from the assessment outcomes which are used to calculate defined benefit assets and liabilities at a particular point in time.
The defined benefit liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet represents the net total for each plan of the present value of the benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets for funded schemes at the balance sheet date.
If a plan is in surplus the asset recognised is limited to the value of any amount expected to be recoverable by the Group by way of refunds or reduction in future contributions.
Under the Groups UK pension scheme rules any surplus arising on payment of agreed contributions is fully recoverable.
For defined contribution plans the Groups contributions are charged to the income statement in the period in which they fall due.

132 672017 30346 PM 2529004 AR 2017 Proof 3 Pensions continued Background information In a defined benefit plan the members are guaranteed a certain level of benefits that depend on a number of factors such as service salary and inflation.
Defined benefit plans can be supported by an asset fund that will be used to pay member benefits or can be unfunded in which case obligations to members are paid by the sponsoring employer as they fall due.
In a defined benefit plan because the level and duration of the members benefits are uncertain the risk of any increase or decrease in the cost of providing those benefits stays with the employer.
This contrasts with a defined contribution plan where the employers only obligation is to pay the amount agreed in the employment contract into a pension plan.
Any change in the total expected cost of providing defined benefits can produce either funding shortfalls or surpluses.
In the case of an expected funding shortfall the Company is usually required to agree a deficit recovery plan which can vary from country to country.
This is usually a combination of additional contributions to make good the shortfall over an agreed period of time sometimes referred to as a funding plan or a minimum funding requirement and can also include an allowance for future asset returns.
In the case of a surplus mechanisms are available in all of the Renold schemes to return that surplus to or utilise it for the benefit of the Group.
UK Pension Plans The principal UK fund is the Renold Pension Scheme RPS.
The RPS was formed in June 2013 by the merger of three predecessor plans all of which were already closed to future accrual and to new members.
The RPS is a funded defined benefit plan with assets held in separate administered funds.
The Trustees are chaired by an independent professional trustee firm and have access to a range of professional advisers.
The Trustee Board is required to consult the Company in matters such as investment policy and to obtain agreement to any amendments to benefits.
The Company can make proposals to the Trustees on a range of issues but cannot insist on their adoption.
The majority of Trustees are either independent or member nominated with Company nominated Trustees being in the minority.
To mitigate the risk of potential conflicts of interests no Directors of Renold plc are Trustees of the RPS.
The RPS is underpinned by a 25 year asset backed partnership structure the Scottish Limited Partnership SLP.
The partnership holds an intercompany loan from Renold International Holdings Limited the holding company for most of the Groups overseas trading companies.
The capital rights to the assets in the SLP belong to Renold plc except in the event of a corporate insolvency of the pension scheme sponsor Renold plc.
The income rights in the SLP belong to the RPS.
The loan generates interest income that provided an annual cash contribution of 2.7m to the pension fund in the current year with annual increases linked to RPI plus 1.5% and capped at 5%.
The income stream is used to fund deficit repair payments and the first 0.5m of annual administrative expenses with the Company bearing the excess if any arises.
In the event that the RPS becomes fully funded on a buyout basis the income stream will instead accrue to Renold plc.
The SLP was put in place with the expectation that the period to recover the funding shortfall was 25 years from the time of merger in June 2013.
The SLP therefore helps reduce the volatility in shortterm cash funding by following an agreed payment plan over a longer period of time.
The interest in the SLP held by the RPS is not reported as a plan asset in the Groups consolidated financial statements as it is a nontransferable interest issued by the Group.
This arrangement replaced all other existing funding arrangements for the RPS.
The SLP therefore represents the entirety of the committed cash element of the funding plan for the RPS.
The funding plan also assumes an allowance for asset outperformance of 1.0% that is assets are expected to return an amount of 1.0% more than the discount rate applied to the liabilities.
Separately to the SLP but put in place at the same time the Group has also agreed that if adjusted operating profits reach 16.0m in any year following the year ended 31 March 2017 additional annual contributions of 1.0m will become payable monthly in arrears while profits remain above this level.
Prior to the SLP the contributions had been at a higher level.
However the Trustees agreed to lower contributions for longer under the SLP.
The 1.0m increase matches the approximate 1.0m reduction agreed when the SLP was established.
Finally as part of the overall agreement Renold plc is not constrained from paying a dividend other than by normal legal considerations.
Renold has agreed to make additional contributions equal to 25% of the value of any dividend paid in order to accelerate the deficit recovery plan.
The deficit will be reduced as the cash contributions under the scheme are made enhanced or offset by actual performance compared to asset returns and actuarial assumptions.
Following the implementation of the two medically underwritten insured buyins that fully derisked approximately 25% of current pensioner liabilities implemented in the year ended 31 March 2016 the growth assets of the RPS represented over 90% of the remaining invested assets of the scheme.
Following review a revised investment strategy has been adopted by the Trustees with the agreement of the Company which will redress the balance to circa 67% growth assets and 33% protection assets whilst further diversifying the risk with the introduction of multiasset credit MAC and liability driven investments LDI to the portfolio.

This process concluded that contributions to the scheme should continue unchanged and no additional contributions in excess of the previously agreed asset backed funding structure were deemed necessary.
The next triennial valuation date will be 5 April 2019.
Overseas Pension Plans
In Germany in addition to participating in the state backed pension scheme the Group operates an unfunded defined benefit scheme no other Group company operates such a scheme.
Unfunded means that the scheme has no asset backing to pay benefits and instead the Group pays member benefits as they fall due.
The scheme closed to new members on 1 April 1992.
A German court confirmed that the pension scheme was properly closed to future accrual with effect from 31 March 2014.
Following the acquisition of the Tooth Chain business in the year the unfunded defined benefit scheme operated by that business transferred to our German subsidiary.
The IAS 19 liability at the acquisition date was 0.4m.
In aggregate the two 2016 two German pension schemes have a net liability of 25.5m 2016 23.8m.
The change in the net deficit is due to a reduction in the discount rate 1.9% 2016 2.0% and the adverse impact of the change in the Euro foreign exchange rate.
United States of America In the US the Group operates three defined benefit pension schemes in the US Torque Transmission business.
In 2015 one of the three schemes was formally terminated and members benefits secured in full.
The remaining two schemes are closed to new members and one is also closed to future accrual.
Only the hourly paid scheme remains open to future accrual.
Funds that had been earmarked for the terminated scheme are now being used to accelerate making good the deficit in the second fully closed US scheme with a similar intention to terminate and secure member benefits in the next two years.
The US Chain business operates a defined contribution scheme.
In aggregate the two 2016 two defined benefit schemes in the US have combined assets of 11.2m 2016 8.8m and liabilities of 15.0m 2016 13.4m giving a net deficit of 3.8m 2016 4.6m.
The change in the net deficit was due to an increase in the discount rate to 3.8% 2016 3.6% offset by the adverse impact of the change in the US Dollar foreign exchange rate.
Other overseas schemes In aggregate the other overseas defined benefit schemes have combined assets of 2.4m 2016 2.0m and liabilities of 3.0m 2016 2.7m giving a net deficit of 0.6m 2016 net deficit of 0.7m.
Other overseas employees participate in a variety of different pension arrangements of the defined contribution or defined benefit type funded in accordance with local practice.
The pension disclosures in the financial statements are based on the most recent actuarial valuations.
Where material these have been updated to the balance sheet date by qualified independent actuaries.
The disclosures provided are presented on a weighted average basis where appropriate.
Plan assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates.
The weighted average durations for the UK pension scheme is 15 years 2016 15 years and 14 years 2016 14 years for the German schemes.
They can therefore be regarded as mature schemes.
Significant assumptions The principal financial assumptions used to calculate plan liabilities as at 31 March 2017 are presented below.
The assumptions adopted represent the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which due to the timescale covered may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The present values of the plans liabilities are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are thus inherently uncertain.

The inflation assumption used for UK schemes is a blend of RPI and CPI as well as reflecting that members have the option to take a oneoff increase in pension at retirement in exchange for surrendering future increases.
Approximately 25% of members took this option.

In addition to the assumptions shown previously mortality assumptions have a significant bearing on the calculated obligation.
The assumed life expectancy for the RPS members on retirement at age 65 is as follows 2017 2016
Currently aged 45 21.2 21.4 Currently aged 65 20.3 20.4
Currently aged 45 23.4 23.7 Currently aged 65 22.3 22.6 The postretirement mortality tables used for the UK plan are the S2PA series tables published by the UK actuarial profession with a 20% uplift in mortality reflecting scheme specific experience.
The RPS experiences mortality significantly in excess of the national average.
The mortality rates for the RPS are based on average year of birth for both nonpensioners and pensioners with an allowance for future annual improvements in life expectancy.
In Germany the mortality expectations for the scheme are in line with the local national averages as is the case in the United States.

Hedge funds and diversified growth funds hold a range of assets which aim to deliver returns above those of bonds but at lower volatility than equities.
The assets held materially reflect the underlying liabilities in that lower risk assets such as gilts and bonds are deemed to be a match for pensioner liabilities whereas equities are deemed a better match for the liabilities associated with scheme members not yet in retirement.
Liability Driven Investments LDI are a portfolio of assets that are linked to the drivers of movements in pension liabilities such as inflation and interest rates.
These are assets designed to deliver geared movements in the underlying liabilities as they reflect changes to inflation and interest rates.

Sharebased payments Accounting Policy The Group operates equitysettled sharebased compensation plans.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is calculated using a BlackScholes pricing model and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options or performance shares granted.
At each balance sheet date the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates if any in the income statement and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest except for awards where vesting is conditional upon market or nonvesting conditions which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or nonvesting condition is satisfied provided that all other performance or service conditions are satisfied.
The marketbased conditions are linked to the market price of shares in the Company.
Where the terms of an equitysettled award are modified or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award the cost based on the original award terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period.
In addition an expense is recognised over the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modification based on the difference between the fair value of the original award and the fair value of the modified award both as measured on the date of the modification.
No reduction is recognised if this difference is negative.

140 672017 30347 PM 2529004 AR 2017 Proof 3 Financial instruments Accounting Policy The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is desired the hedging relationship is formally designated and documented at its inception.
This documentation identifies the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge the hedging instrument the hedged item or transaction the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration.
Such hedges are expected at inception to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the reporting period for which they were designated.
For the purpose of hedge accounting hedges are classified as Cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction or Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation.
There are no fair value hedges.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken to the income statement.
The treatment of gains and losses arising from revaluing derivatives designated as hedging instruments depends on the nature of the hedging relationship as follows a Cash flow hedges For cash flow hedges the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in other comprehensive income while the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.
Amounts taken to other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects the income statement such as when a forecast sale occurs.
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover or if its designation as a hedge is revoked amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs and are transferred to the income statement or to the initial carrying amount of a nonfinancial asset or liability as above.
If the related transaction is not expected to occur the amount is taken to the income statement.
Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation including a hedge of a monetary item that is accounted for as part of the net investment are accounted for in a way similar to cash flow hedges.
Gains or losses relating to the effective portion are recognised in other comprehensive income while any gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognised in the income statement.
On loss of control of the foreign operation the cumulative value of any such gains or losses recognised directly in other comprehensive income is transferred to the income statement.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not stated at its fair value with changes in its fair value recognised in the income statement.
The Groups 6% cumulative preference stock of 1 each Preference Stock has been classified as a liability.
Dividends payable are included within net finance costs.
