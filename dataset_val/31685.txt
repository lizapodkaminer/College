Chairmans Statement
Sir Michael Heller Turnover for the year to 30 September 2017 was 5.11 million compared with 4.96 million the previous year an increase of 3%.
At the halfyear stage we reported that sales activity had improved modestly compared to the previous year and that continued into the second half in spite of a challenging market.
Adjusted operating profit was 540000 compared with 430000 last year an increase of 26%.
This profit measure which excludes noncash IFRS items and exceptional nontrading costs is reconciled to statutory operating profit in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
As management exercised tight control to maintain overheads at similar levels to the previous year the increase in sales had a significant impact on operating profit.
Statutory pretax profit for the year also increased to 417000 compared with 244000 the prior year an increase of 71%.
Last years result included oneoff property costs of 104000 relating to a property that we have now sold.
Adjusting for that item would result in an increase in statutory pretax profit of 20%.
Contracted recurring revenues which comprise annual software licence fees and periodic hosting charges remained strong at 80% of total revenues 2016 82%.
Revenues delivered through our hosting centre continued to increase and in the year under review represented 61% of total revenues 2016 59%.
RandD cash expenditure for the year was 901000 2016 982000 and was principally focussed on continued enhancements to our key products Quantum VS and Vecta.
As previously reported we sold our remaining surplus freehold property for 1.2 million in December 2016.
The propertys carrying value had previously been adjusted to reflect the expected net sale proceeds which after disposal costs amounted to 1.17 million.
The process that we started some years ago to dispose of six freehold properties which had become surplus to operating requirements has generated more than 7 million of cash which has supported distributions to shareholders in excess of 11 million over the same period.
At the year end our cash balances were 6.4 million compared with 5.4 million last year.
The increase reflects the proceeds from the sale of property referred to above.
Operating cash flows were 580000 2016 818000 and dividends paid amounted to 635000 2016 631000.
Net assets at 30 September 2017 were 6.4 million compared to 3.2 million at 30 September 2016.
This significant increase is principally due to the elimination of the deficit on the defined benefit pension scheme under IAS 19.
Net of deferred tax the position on the scheme has improved by 3.4 million during the year due largely to improved surrender terms for the schemes principal asset.
This matter is explained further in the Chief Executives Statement.
The Directors are proposing to pay a final dividend of 3.0p per share 2016 3.0p giving a total dividend for the year of 5.0p the same as last year.
Total cash dividends paid to shareholders will therefore amount to 635000.
If approved by shareholders the final dividend will be paid on 6 April 2018 to those shareholders on the register at 9 March 2018.
The shares will be exdividend on 8 March 2018.
We announced last year that we are carrying out a strategic review of the business.
As previously reported uncertainty over the pension scheme valuation since March 2017 has impacted on the strategic review process and caused it to take longer than originally expected.
However the process is continuing now that the actuarial valuation of the scheme has been completed.
Should the strategic review process not result in an acceptable offer being made for the Company the Board confirms that it intends to consider returning an amount of cash to shareholders subject to any constraints on distributable reserves and the rules of the Takeover Code.
However it should be noted that the improvement in the Groups net asset position referred to above positively impacts our distributable reserves.
The
Company will update shareholders further when it is in a position to do so.
I would like to thank all our members of staff and my colleagues on the Board for their contribution during the year.
With a strong cashgenerative business model and a debtfree balance sheet I remain confident that the business is well positioned for the future.
Sir Michael Heller
12 December 2017
Turnover for the year to 30 September 2017 was 5.11 million compared with 4.96 million the previous year an increase of 3%.
Net assets at 30 September 2017 were 6.4 million compared to 3.2 million at 30 September 2016.
This significant increase is principally due to the elimination of the deficit on the defined benefit pension scheme under IAS 19.
The Directors are proposing to pay a final dividend of 3.0p per share 2016 3.0p giving a total dividend for the year of 5.0p the same as last year.
Electronic Data Processing PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 3 Governance Notice of meeting Strategic report Financial statements Chief Executives Statement Julian Wassell Revenue for the year was up 3% at 5.11 million compared with 4.96 million the year before.
We saw slightly higher sales activity throughout the year in relation to both of our key products Quantum VS and Vecta and also increased levels of professional services activity for which credit should go to our professional services team.
Because of the high margin nature of the business our gross margin is typically over 90% this increase in turnover had a significant impact on our underlying operating profitability which increased 26% to 540000 from 430000 a year earlier.
Continued careful management of the cost base meant that overheads as used in the calculation of adjusted operating profit were maintained at near identical levels to the previous year.
Whilst an increase in sales of 3% can result in a 26% increase in operating profit we are always mindful that the converse is also true and remain vigilant in controlling the cost base.
In common with many businesses we are conscious that the UK economy faces considerable uncertainty over the coming years.
Most of our customers are directly impacted by Brexit one way or another.
The majority of them import and are affected by the significant exchange rate movements that we have experienced over the last 18 months or so.
Different sectors have varying views of the future with some of those in the Builders Merchants sector for example currently feeling more positive than some of those who are not directly involved in construction.
The fact that we offer our products into a variety of industry verticals within the distribution sector provides our business with a good degree of resilience as we are not overly reliant on any one sector.
However economic uncertainty typically can mean that significant capital expenditure decisions can be delayed or even cancelled as businesses take a wait and see approach.
Our consistent strategy for many years has been to strengthen the relationship we have with our customers by growing the proportion of our revenues delivered through our hosting centre in Milton Keynes.
Last year hit yet another record as 61% of our revenues were delivered using the hosting model.
This was up from 59% last year and in fact we have seen this figure grow for 17 out of the last 18 years.
We continue to manage the migration process from our legacy applications to Quantum VS carefully.
At 30 September 2017 we had signed 48 customers for Quantum VS compared to 40 a year earlier.
The decision to change ERP solution is a major decision for any business and whilst we believe that Quantum VS provides an excellent solution for the majority of the users of our older legacy products the migration process itself inevitably leads to higher levels of customer churn than we have historically seen.
This will continue to be the case.
Some of the users of our legacy products are keen to remain on their current system for the foreseeable future and we are geared to offer a flexible approach to work with them.
This often leads to a new long term 5 year contract which provides them with comfort and us with excellent visibility of revenues and the ability to plan our resources going forwards.
Of course we will seek to promote Quantum VS to them at an appropriate time in the future.
Our combined CRM and Business Intelligence BI product Vecta generated 28% of total revenues during the period under review up from 25% a year earlier.
We have stated previously that in the medium term we would expect to see the proportion of our total revenues represented by Vecta to increase due to the fact that its sales cycle is much shorter than that for an ERP solution such as Quantum VS and this remains the case.
Strategy
Our principal software products Quantum VS and Vecta offer clear business benefits to our customers helping them to generate sales growth or to create efficiencies and reduce costs.
Quantum VS and Vecta are complementary with many of our customers using both.
Quantum VS is a comprehensive ERP application which addresses a focussed number of verticals within the distribution sector including builders and timber merchants suppliers of fixings and fastenings industrial and security products and electrical wholesalers.
As noted above our longterm strategy is to manage the migration of customers from our four legacy applications Merchant Charisma Esprit and The Business Programme to Quantum VS whilst identifying and exploiting new business opportunities in our target vertical markets.
Summary
Revenue for the year was up 3% at 5.11 million compared with 4.96 million the year before.
We saw slightly higher sales activity throughout the year in relation to both of our key products Quantum VS and Vecta.
This increase in turnover had a significant impact on our underlying operating profitability which increased 26% to 540000 from 430000 a year earlier.
Contracted recurring revenues represented 80% of total revenues during the year compared with 82% last year.
Cash balances amounted to 6.4 million at 30 September 2017 up from 5.4 million the previous year.
Last year hit yet another record as 61% of our revenues were delivered using the hosting model.
This was up from 59% last year and in fact we have seen this figure grow for 17 out of the last 18 years.
Electronic Data Processing PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 4 Quantum VS is a comprehensive ERP application which addresses a focussed number of verticals within the distribution sector.
Strategy continued Vecta is an extremely powerful combined CRM and BI product which drives sales growth for businesses in a range of verticals much wider than those addressed by Quantum VS.
Our strategy remains to exploit the space between the major CRM products which typically do not deliver sales analysis as standard and pure BI tools.
We continue to invest in the longterm future of our key products through significant levels of RandD.
During the year to 30 September 2017 our RandD expenditure was 901000 2016 982000.
This represented 18% of total revenues 2016 20%.
Business model All of our software products are supplied under longterm contracts.
In the case of Quantum VS and our legacy products these are typically of five years initial duration in the case of Vecta it is typically three years.
Contracts for ERP applications can be either in the form of traditional onsite licencing arrangements or hosted service level agreements.
In the case of Vecta which is only offered as a cloudbased service new contracts are exclusively hosted service level agreements.
These contracted recurring revenues represented 80% of total revenues during the year compared with 82% last year.
Typically our customer relationships extend well beyond the initial contract period.
The recurring revenue model gives us good visibility of revenues and strong cash flows as charges are mainly invoiced annually in advance.
The remainder of our revenues arise from initial software licence fees initial hosting service charges and the provision of professional services.
We also supply a small amount of lowmargin computer hardware.
Financial review
Revenue for the year was 5.11 million compared with 4.96 million last year an increase of 3%.
Second half revenues were 2.57 million 2016 2.45 million compared with 2.54 million in the first half of the year 2016 2.51 million.
As noted above adjusted operating profit increased 26% to 540000 2016 430000 representing an operating margin of 10.6% 2016 8.7%.
Statutory pretax profit was 417000 2016 244000.
Adjusted operating profit is used by the Board and management to monitor the performance of the business on a daytoday basis and it is the headline profit figure in the management accounts.
It excludes interest receivable any gains and losses on property transactions oneoff exceptional items and a number of noncash items which arise under IFRS including defined benefit pension scheme charges and the capitalisation and amortisation of development costs.
A full reconciliation of adjusted operating profit to statutory operating profit is provided in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
Furthermore as noted in the Remuneration Report adjusted operating profit is the measure on which the Directors bonus is based.
Cash balances amounted to 6.4 million at 30 September 2017 up from 5.4 million the previous year.
This includes operating cash flows of 580000 and 1.2 million cash received from the sale of property.
Other significant cash items were dividends paid of 635000 and capital expenditure of 118000.
RandD expenditure was 901000 2016 982000.
Of this 89000 2016 127000 was capitalised as required by IAS 38.
Amortisation of previously capitalised RandD expenditure amounted to 110000 2016 96000.
Accordingly the RandD charge in the income statement is 922000 2016 951000.
The tax charge for the year was 23000 2016 86000 which represents an effective tax rate of 5.5%.
The main reason for the low effective tax rate this year is a prior year corporation tax adjustment of 71000.
Of
2015 and 2016 accounting periods.
Earnings per share was 3.11p compared to 1.25p last year an increase of 149%.
On a fully diluted basis this amounted to 3.09p 2016 1.24p.
Pension
As a result of the significant increase in the discontinuance surrender value of the defined benefit schemes Grouped Funding policy the value of the pension schemes assets under IAS 19 has increased by approximately 3 million this year.
This factor coupled with actuarial gains of approximately 900000 resulting from updated financial and mortality assumptions has eliminated the deficit of 3.88 million 3.22 million net of deferred tax that was shown in the 2016 balance sheet.
In 2017 the balance sheet shows a small pension surplus under IAS 19 of 240000 156000 net of deferred tax a movement of 4.12 million 3.38 million after deferred tax.
Of this movement net of deferred tax 70000 has been charged in the income statement and 3.45 million has been credited directly to reserves.
Chief Executives Statement continued Julian Wassell Electronic Data Processing PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 5 Governance Notice of meeting Strategic report Financial statements As previously announced the triennial valuation of the scheme as at 31 July 2016 was completed and signed off by the actuary trustees and employer in October 2017.
On a scheme funding basis the deficit at 31 July 2016 was finalised at 70000 representing a funding level of 99%.
The deficit is expected to have been cleared by the 201819 scheme year as a result of the payment of terminal bonuses by the scheme insurer in respect of member retirements that will take place over the next two years.
The formal deficit recovery plan does not therefore require the immediate payment of cash contributions by the Company.
However the Company has agreed with the trustees to make a oneoff contribution of up to a maximum of 118000 payable on or before 31 July 2020 in the event that the terminal bonus payments do not cover the deficit in full.
Net assets Net assets per share increased to 50.7p 2016 25.3p.
The increase is primarily due to the improvement in the position on the defined benefit pension scheme.
Property
As previously reported we sold our last remaining surplus freehold property in December 2016 for 1.2 million.
We had previously written the property down in the balance sheet to reflect the expected net sale proceeds which amounted to 1.17 million after costs.
Following the sale we have achieved expected cash cost savings of around 20000 a year.
Outlook
Balancing the migration of customers from our legacy ERP products to Quantum VS whilst identifying and converting new business opportunities for Quantum VS and Vecta remains our principal focus.
Wider economic factors and uncertainty over Brexit in particular continue to affect business confidence generally and may impact discretionary capital expenditure decisions including replacement of IT systems.
However the strength of our business model built around an 80% recurring revenue base together with continued investment in our sales team and product development should mean we are well placed to deal with the challenges we face over the coming year.
Finally I would like to thank all of my colleagues throughout the business for their hard work and commitment during the year.
Julian Wassell Chief Executive 12 December 2017 Vecta is an extremely powerful combined CRM and BI product which drives sales growth for businesses in a range of verticals.
Key Performance
The following financial KPIs are used by the Board to review the performance of the business Level of software related revenues Revenue from software and services increased by 2.7% in FY17.
Sales of software and services account for 97% of total Group revenues in FY17 with the remainder comprising lowmargin hardware sales and hardware maintenance.
Adjusted operating profit margin Our adjusted operating margin was 10.6% in FY17 compared with 8.7% in FY16.
Adjusted operating margin is calculated using operating profit excluding oneoff property costs certain noncash IFRS adjustments relating to defined benefit pension scheme charges holiday pay accruals and capitalisation amortisation of development costs and other exceptional nontrading items.
A reconciliation of statutory operating profit to adjusted operating profit is shown in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
Level of contracted recurring revenues Recurring revenues represent 80% of total revenues in FY17 compared with 82% in FY16.
Recurring revenues underpin our business model and principally comprise contracted ongoing software licences and hosting fees.
Level and growth of hosted revenues 61% of our revenues were delivered through our hosting centre in FY17 compared with 59% in FY16.
Electronic Data Processing PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 6 Risk Potential impact Mitigation Systems and networks EDPs business operations rely significantly on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its information technology systems and networks.
Our computer network may be vulnerable to unauthorised access viruses and other disruptive problems.
Any damage or interruption to EDPs networks however caused could have a material adverse effect on the delivery of our products and services.
A party that is able to override security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause disruption to our operations.
We continually review and test the security of internal systems and networks and have developed recovery plans in the event of systems disruption.
We use a third party to internally and externally scan our network to identify any potential vulnerability.
Where reliance is placed upon externally provided systems and networks we undertake regular performance ability reviews and ensure that contracts provide for an appropriate level of service maintenance.
Product technology advances The markets in which EDP operates are characterised by evolving technology market practices and industry standards.
Competitors could develop superior products or more costeffective techniques which could render our products uncompetitive or less acceptable to the market.
This could result in the loss of new revenue opportunities the nonrenewal of contracts by existing customers or the failure of users of our legacy applications to migrate to Quantum VS.
We have an ongoing commitment to research and development which allows us to identify and adapt to any technological and market changes that do occur thereby ensuring that our products continue to meet the demands of our customers.
Principal Risks and Uncertainties We operate in a changing economic and technological environment that presents risks many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict.
The key risks and uncertainties facing EDP and the measures taken to mitigate these risks are as follows Electronic Data Processing PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 7 Governance Notice of meeting Strategic report Financial statements Risk Potential impact Mitigation External economic factors As with most other businesses in the UK our operations can be adversely affected by a significant downturn in the economy.
The
UK economy faces considerable uncertainty over the coming years and most of our customers the majority of whom import and are therefore exposed to exchange rate movements are directly impacted by Brexit.
Furthermore the uncertainties caused by Brexit could have a significant impact on discretionary capital expenditure decisions including IT projects.
Restricted availability of finance for businesses and a stagnant or recessionary economy could have an adverse effect on the prospects for EDP as potential customers particularly in the builders and timber merchants sectors may scale back their IT plans in response to funding difficulties andor reduced prospects for their businesses.
We seek to ensure that a significant proportion of our revenues are derived from longterm contracts with our customers that our products appeal to businesses operating in a range of business sectors and that payments for our recurring fees are received annually in advance.
Competitor activity EDP operates in a competitive environment.
New entrants to our marketplace and actions taken by existing competitors could have an impact on our levels of business activity and product pricing in the market generally.
We endeavour to provide excellent customer support together with high quality products at a competitive price in order to develop and protect strong customer relationships.
Key employees In common with all peoplebased businesses our success will to a significant extent be dependent on the experience of the Board and senior management.
The retention of the services of EDPs key employees cannot be guaranteed.
The loss of key employees could have a material adverse effect on EDP.
The failure to retain and develop key technical skills and product knowledge could hinder EDPs future prospects.
We are continually focused on the need to recruit retain reward and motivate staff with the appropriate skills.
Electronic Data Processing PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 8 Environmental information The Groups operations which are principally software development and hosting by their nature have a minimal impact on the environment.
Nevertheless the Group is committed to minimising the impact of its activities on the environment through initiatives such as the provision of fuelefficient cars to company car drivers and encouraging waste recycling at Group locations.
Greenhouse gas emissions During the year ended 30 September 2017 the Group purchased 584000 kWh 2016 590000 kWh of electricity the majority of which was used at the Groups hosting centre in Milton Keynes.
Using the 2017 conversion factor for grid electricity published by Defra this equated to 205 tonnes 2016 243 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emitted.
This equated to approximately 3.2 tonnes 2016 3.6 tonnes per Group employee.
The Group also operates a fleet of cars.
During the year ended 30 September 2017 the total carbon dioxide equivalent emitted by the vehicles calculated from the manufacturers emissions rating for each car was 68 tonnes 2016 79 tonnes.
This equated to an average of 3.0 tonnes per vehicle 2016 3.6 tonnes.
Employee information At the end of the financial year the Group employed 68 people.
This figure includes three Executive and two NonExecutive Directors all of whom are male.
There are five senior managers four of whom are male and one female.

Mr J.
Wassell is not involved in determining his own remuneration.
The NonExecutive Directors serving on the remuneration committee are not involved in determining their own individual remuneration.
Individual Directors remuneration is detailed in the Directors

The remuneration committee held one meeting during the year and was attended by all members.
Nomination committee The nomination committee comprises Sir Michael Heller Mr A.
Heller and Mr J.
Wassell.
The committee is responsible for proposing candidates for appointment to the Board having regard to the balance of skills experience and knowledge of the Company on the Board how the Board works together as a unit and other factors relevant to its effectiveness.
The committee did not formally meet during the year as the current composition of the Board is considered by the committee to be appropriate.
The Board considers the structure of the committee to be appropriate given the size of the Company.
All Directors are subject to reelection at a maximum of every three years.
The Board does not have a formal policy on diversity.
Appointments to the Board are recommended by the nomination committee on the basis of the experience and abilities of the candidate regardless of gender or race.
Going concern The Groups business activities together with the factors likely to affect its future development performance and position along with the financial position of the Group its cash flows and liquidity position are described in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 8.
In addition note 20 to the financial statements includes details of the Groups financial instruments and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable financial resources together with a significant proportion of the Groups revenues being derived from longterm contracts with established customers.
As a consequence the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
After making enquiries the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts.
Viability statement In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the Code the Directors have assessed the future prospects of the Company over a threeyear period from the date of these accounts.
An assessment period of three years was chosen for the following reasons The Groups software licences and hosting agreements for its ERP software are generally for five years in duration.
Other software agreements are generally for three years.
This means that on average the Groups average unexpired software contract duration is typically two to three years.
The industry in which the Company operates in is fast moving and subject to technological change.
In this context an assessment period in excess of three years is considered inappropriate.
The review was based upon the approved budget for the forthcoming year and built in assumptions consistent with the Groups overall strategy on growth rates for the following two years.
The assessment considered amongst other things operating profitability cash generation and dividend cover.
These metrics were subject to sensitivity analysis which involved adjusting on a cumulative basis a number of the key assumptions underlying the forecasts.
As part of the review the Directors performed a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Company.
Based on the results of this review the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the threeyear assessment period.

Internal audit The Board reviews from time to time whether there is a need for an internal audit function and on its last review concluded that due to the size of the Group and the internal controls that are currently in place no specific function is required at the present time.
Investor relations The Group enters into dialogue with both institutional and private shareholders at the AGM and also on an adhoc basis during the year.
All Directors are required to attend the AGM in order among other things to ensure they develop an understanding of the views of the Companys shareholders.
A separate resolution is held for each issue at the AGM.
It is the Directors intention that all shareholders will receive at least 20 working days notice of the AGM.
The Group publishes its annual report and accounts and interim report along with other information on its website at site
The Group complied with the provisions of the Code throughout the period under review other than as detailed below The Groups NonExecutive Directors have not been appointed for specified terms.
The Board considers that because of the requirement for the NonExecutive Directors to stand for reelection at least every three years specified terms are not required.
The Code prescribes that NonExecutive Directors should be appointed for specified terms B.2.3.
The Board is aware that the two NonExecutive Directors are not regarded as independent for the purposes of the Code.
As a result there is no senior independent NonExecutive Director and the Company therefore does not apply Code provisions A.4.1 and A.4.2.
The Board considers that the structure of the Board is appropriate for the size and complexity of the Company.
The Board considers that it is appropriate to operate a continual informal evaluation process given the size and complexity of the Company.
The Code prescribes that the Board should state in the annual report how the performance evaluation of the Board its committees and its individual Directors has been conducted B.6.1.
The audit committee and remuneration committee are both chaired by the NonExecutive Chairman and as a result the Company does not fully comply with Code provisions C.3.1 and D.2.1.
The nomination committee has no independent NonExecutive Directors serving on it and consequently the Company does not comply fully with provision B.2.1.
The Board considers that the structure of the Board committees is appropriate for the size and complexity of the Company.
The NonExecutive Chairman who has served on the Board for over nine years stands for election every three years rather than every year as prescribed by provision B.7.1.
The Board considers this is appropriate given the Companys size and complexity.

The main responsibilities of the audit committee are to monitor the adequacy of the Groups internal financial controls to take primary responsibility for appointing and reappointing auditors to review and monitor the scope results and cost effectiveness of the external audit process to monitor the procedures in place to safeguard the objectivity of the auditor and its independence in relation to nonaudit services to review the key assumptions and estimates or judgements that have been applied by management in the published financial statements and to consider the need for an internal audit function.
The audit committee meets three times during the year.
Meetings are held prior to publication of the annual results and halfyear results.
A meeting is also held just after the year end to review among other things the significant judgements and estimates made by management in preparing the financial statements.
During this meeting the external auditor presents its strategy document.
Both members of the committee along with the Chief Executive and Finance Director attended all meetings.
The external auditor attended two meetings.
The committee has concluded that given the size and complexity of the Group there is no current need for an internal audit function.
The committee has considered the following significant accounting issues and areas of estimation and judgement in relation to these financial statements We considered the accounting policy as presented by the Finance Director in a paper prepared for the committee relating to recognition of revenue and whether the established policy was still appropriate for the business.
We were content that the current policy was still appropriate.
We were satisfied that the Groups internal controls for ensuring that revenues were allocated to the correct period were effective.
We considered the approach taken by management in updating the key assumptions used in the valuation of the Groups defined benefit pension scheme following guidance from the independent scheme actuary and were content that the approach was appropriate.
We considered the processes put in place by management as presented by the Finance Director in a paper prepared for the committee for the identification and recording of expenditure on software development which is capitalised and amortised under IAS 38.
We were satisfied that these processes were appropriate.
The committee has considered the effectiveness and quality of the external audit process.
A key element of this is a review of the auditors formal Audit Strategy Document which is presented to the committee prior to the commencement of the annual audit.
This document highlights to the committee the auditors assessment of audit materiality and the key audit focus areas.
It also includes a formal assessment of the auditors independence.
The Groups auditors KPMG LLP and their legacy predecessors have been in place since 1965.
In line with the audit professions own ethical guidance the audit engagement partner is rotated every five years.
The committee has considered whether it is appropriate to put the external audit contract out to tender.
It has concluded that currently there is no requirement to conduct a tender process.
The committee has also reviewed the procedures that are in place to safeguard the objectivity of the auditor and its independence in relation to nonaudit services.
The auditor is excluded from undertaking a range of work on behalf of the Group which includes tax advisory work appraisal or valuation services management functions litigation support and accounting and remuneration services.

Directors Remuneration Report
Remuneration Committee Chairmans Statement
I am pleased to present the Directors Remuneration Report for the year ended 30 September 2017.
The Directors remuneration policy was approved by shareholders at the Companys Annual General Meeting AGM on 21 March 2017 and became effective immediately.
Of those shareholders who voted by proxy on this resolution some 97% voted in favour of the policy.
The policy will apply until the 2020 AGM unless approval for a change in the policy is sought during this time.
As described in the policy report the remuneration committee concluded that the preexisting arrangements for remunerating the Executive Directors were an appropriate basis for framing the new policy and has been implemented accordingly.
As we will not be proposing a resolution to approve the Directors remuneration policy at the forthcoming AGM and in accordance with The Large and Mediumsized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013 we have not included a separate Directors remuneration policy report within this Remuneration Report.
A copy of the current Directors remuneration policy which can be found on pages 20 to 23 of the Groups 2016 Annual Report and Accounts is on the Companys website site or can be obtained by writing to the Company Secretary.
This year the remuneration committee has awarded the Executive Directors bonuses totalling in aggregate 36000 in respect of the current financial year.
In accordance with the remuneration policy the maximum potential bonus pool has been calculated at 10% of adjusted operating profit.
The allocation of the total bonus amounting to 60% of the maximum potential bonus to the individual Executive Directors is shown on page 17.

In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Groups and of the Parent Companys affairs as at 30 September 2017 and of the Groups profit for the year then ended the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK accounting standards including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework and the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and as regards the Group financial statements Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing UK ISAs UK and applicable law.
Our responsibilities are described below.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion.
Our audit opinion is consistent with our report to the audit committee.
We were appointed as auditor by the Company before 1985.
The period of total uninterrupted engagement is for more than the 22 financial years ended 30 September 2017.
We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under and we remain independent of the Group in accordance with UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities.
No nonaudit services prohibited by that standard were provided.
2 Key audit matters our assessment of risks of material misstatement Key audit matters are those matters that in our professional judgment were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement whether or not due to fraud identified by us including those which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
We summarise below the key audit matters unchanged from 2016 in decreasing order of audit significance in arriving at our audit opinion above together with our key audit procedures to address those matters and as required for public interest entities our results from those procedures.
These matters were addressed and our results are based on procedures undertaken in the context of and solely for the purpose of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon and consequently are incidental to that opinion and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Group and Parent Company Revenue recognition Group revenue 5108000 deferred income 1883000 2016 revenue 4958000 deferred income 2097000 Parent Company revenue 2102000 deferred income 637000 2016 revenue 1980000 deferred income 810000.
Risk vs 2016 Refer to page 15 Audit Committee Report pages 31 to 32 Accounting Policy and page 42 financial disclosures.
The risk  Accounting application The Groups contracts with its customers involve the delivery of multiple services.
Revenue recognition within the Group may require the separate recognition of revenue for each service and as a result there is judgement required over the calculation of the relative fair values for each element of the services.
This includes elements of upfront recognition and the spreading of other revenues over the period of service resulting in significant deferred income balances.
Although the contracts entered into by the Group are of limited complexity and variety there are a large number of transactions to be processed as a result there is a risk that not all revenue is recognized in the appropriate period.
Our response  In this area our audit procedures included Accounting analysis  determining if several performance obligations exist within a contract that result in more than one component of revenue.
This was achieved by assessing a sample of contracts using the guidance in the relevant accounting standard.
This included an assessment of the subjective fair value attributed to each component of revenue within a contract.
Sector experience  considering the appropriateness and consistency of the Groups approach to allocating revenue to each component of a transaction using our sector knowledge and making an assessment of the margin recognised for each different component of revenue.
Tests of detail  testing a sample of revenue transactions to assess if revenue was recorded correctly during the period or deferred for future periods with reference to customer orders contractual documentation and details of supply of services.
Assessing transparency  assessing the appropriateness of the Groups disclosures in respect of amounts recognised as revenue and deferred revenue.
Our results  The results of our testing were satisfactory and we considered the amount of revenue recognised in the year and deferred to be acceptable 2016 acceptable.
Governance Notice of meeting Strategic report Electronic Data Processing PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements 2 Key audit matters our assessment of risks of material misstatement continued Group and Parent Company Defined Benefit Pension Scheme Group and Parent Company net asset 240000 2016 net liability 3883000.
Risk vs 2016 Refer to page 15 Audit Committee Report page 33 Accounting Policy and pages 44 to 47 financial disclosures.
The risk  Subjective valuation  The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme.
The closed scheme has an extremely small number of members in terms of active and deferred members and also those currently receiving pensions.
An assessment of the underlying valuation of the scheme requires significant estimates to be applied and due to the small membership a small change in certain of these estimates could have a material effect on the Groups results and financial position.
Our response  In this area our audit procedures included Benchmarking assumptions  comparing the Groups assumptions to market data as well as with the support of our own actuarial specialist our own assessments in relation to key inputs such as inflation rates discount rates increases in pay increases in pension payments increases for deferred pensioners and in particular mortality rates.
Assessing valuers credentials  evaluating the competence and independence of the external actuary who calculates the IAS 19 valuation with reference to their experience qualifications and credentials.
Tests of detail  comparing the asset valuations used in the IAS 19 valuation to the surrender value provided by the insurer.
Assessing transparency  assessing the adequacy of the Groups disclosures in relation to the assumptions applied in determining the defined benefit liability.
Our results  The results of our testing were satisfactory and we found the net defined benefit asset 2016 liability recognised to be acceptable 2016 acceptable.
Group and Parent Company Capitalised development costs Group and Parent Company costs capitalised 89000 2016 127000.
Risk vs 2016 Refer to page 15 Audit Committee Report page 32 Accounting Policy and page 41 financial disclosures.
The risk  Accounting treatment  The capitalisation criteria are inherently judgmental and there is a risk that qualifying projects may not be identified.
There is also the risk that projects not meeting the relevant criteria are capitalised.
Further there is also a risk that development costs attributable to such projects may be misstated as they relate largely to developers time which is required to be captured and appropriately allocated to specific development projects.
Our response  Our audit procedures included Testing application  analysing current years expensed costs to identify projects that have not been capitalised and obtaining and corroborating for example by reference to publicly available information such as product and upgrade release dates the Groups explanations for why such costs have not been capitalised.
Sector experience  for qualifying projects considering the Groups assessment of their future technical and financial prospects by reference to our knowledge of the Groups business and our experience of the industry.
Reperformance  critically assessing the costs capitalised under such projects by reperforming the Groups calculation of staff costs attributable to qualifying projects with reference to timesheets and payroll data where appropriate.

Governance Notice of meeting Strategic report Electronic Data Processing PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements 6 We have nothing to report on the other matters on which we are required to report by exception Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if in our opinion adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us or the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns or certain disclosures of Directors remuneration specified by law are not made or we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
We have nothing to report in these respects.
7 Respective responsibilities Directors responsibilities As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 20 the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements including being satisfied that they give a true and fair view such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error assessing the Group and Parent Companys ability to continue as a going concern disclosing as applicable matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors responsibilities Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud other irregularities or error and to issue our opinion in an Auditors Report.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs UK will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud other irregularities or error and are considered material if individually or in aggregate they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud or other irregularities is higher than for one resulting from error as they may involve collusion forgery intentional omissions misrepresentations or the override of internal control and may involve any area of law and regulation not just those directly affecting the financial statements.
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRCs website at www. rc. iteauditorsresponsibilities.

There was no impact on the consolidated income statement or the consolidated balance sheet presented.
Governance Notice of meeting Strategic report Electronic Data Processing PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements forming part of the financial statements Reporting entity Electronic Data Processing PLC is a public limited company listed on the London Stock Exchange and incorporated and domiciled in England.
The principal activity of the Company is the provision of computer software solutions.
The address of the Companys registered office is 4th Floor Fountain Precinct Balm Green Sheffield S1 2JA.
Statement of compliance The Groups financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU adopted IFRS as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the year ended 30 September 2017 and applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The principal accounting policies of the Group are set out in note 2.
The Company has elected to prepare its Parent Company financial statements in accordance with FRS 101.
The Company is taking advantage of the exemption in s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and related notes.
Significant accounting policies The significant accounting policies set out below have unless otherwise stated been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Group financial statements.
Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with adopted IFRS and under the historical cost basis except as described elsewhere in note 2.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the accounts of Electronic Data Processing PLC and all its subsidiaries.
Such accounts are all made up to 30 September 2017.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
In assessing control the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights.
The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Functional and presentational currency The financial statements are presented in sterling which is the Groups presentational currency.
The Parent Companys functional currency is sterling.
All financial information presented in sterling has been rounded to the nearest thousand.
Foreign currency Sales to overseas customers which are denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets resulting from sales denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Revenue
The Groups revenues derive from a number of sources which are described below.
All revenue excludes value added tax and any sales between Group companies.
Revenue relating to future periods is deferred.
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
The Groups software revenues derive from its software licensing contracts and software hosting agreements.
Revenue from new software licences which typically run for between three and five years is broken down into two components namely an initial licence fee payable upfront and periodic charges which are payable over the licence term.
Initial licence fee revenue is recognised in full on delivery of the software to the customer following receipt of a noncancellable contract.
The Group considers that at this point its primary contractual obligation the delivery of the current version of the software for use on the customers own computer system has been satisifed.
The Group considers that at this point a significant proportion of the risks and rewards of ownership of the licence have been transferred to the customer.
The periodic charges which reflect the Groups ongoing requirement to maintain and support the software are recognised on a straight line basis as the remaining risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer over the contract term.
32 Electronic Data Processing PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued forming part of the financial statements Significant accounting policies continued Revenue continued The Group provides software hosting services through its standard Service Level Agreements SLA which also typically run for between three and five years.
A new SLA has two separately identified fee components an initial service charge payable by the customer up front and a periodic service charge payable annually quarterly or monthly over the contract term.
In the case of an SLA for the Groups ERP software the initial service charge represents a payment to acquire the software licence along with a charge for the services required to install the software and configure the hosted service on a server allocated to the customer.
This revenue is recognised once a noncancellable SLA is signed and the customer is provided with access to the software on their hosted server.
Periodic service charges are recognised evenly over the contract term reflecting the Groups obligation to support the software and maintain the provision of the hosted service throughout the contract period.
In the case of an SLA for the Groups Vecta hosted service the initial service charge is attributed to the configuration and database preparation services that are provided at the start of the agreement and are deemed to have standalone value to the customer.
This revenue is recognised once a customer is provided with access to their database on the Groups multitenanted Vecta server.
The periodic charges which reflect the Groups obligation to provide the Vecta hosted service throughout the contract period are recognised evenly over time.
Other software related revenues are mainly from the provision of professional services including implementation training and consultancy.
This revenue is recognised when the services have been performed.
Sales of computer equipment are recognised on delivery to customers and equipment maintenance charges are recognised evenly over the period to which they relate.
Exceptional costs Exceptional costs are oneoff items of expenditure which in the opinion of the Directors do not directly relate to the underlying trading performance of the Group.
Property plant and equipment Property plant and equipment is stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Land is not depreciated.
Depreciation is provided so as to write off the cost or deemed cost less the estimated residual value of each asset in equal instalments over its estimated useful life from the time it becomes operational at the following rates Freehold property 1 to 2% Motor vehicles 20 to 33% Fixtures fittings and equipment  15 to 25% Software intellectual property rights Assets are initially carried at cost including any incidental expenses of acquisition.
Following initial recognition they are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Software intellectual property rights are amortised over a period of between three and ten years on a straight line basis and amortised from the time the software is brought into use.
Research and development Expenditure on research activities undertaken with the prospect of gaining new technical knowledge and understanding is recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes.
Development expenditure is capitalised only if development costs can be measured reliably the product or process is technically and commercially feasible future economic benefits are probable and the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete development and to use or sell the asset.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials direct labour and overheads that are directly attributable to preparing the asset for its intended use.
Other development expenditure not meeting these criteria is recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Capitalised development expenditure is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation is based on the cost of an asset less its residual value.
Capitalised software development costs are amortised over a period of between three and seven years on a straight line basis and amortised from the time the asset becomes available for use.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of purchase cost and net realisable value.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables which generally have terms of up to 30 days are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectable amounts.
Provision is made where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect part or all of a debt.
Bad debts are written off as identified.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents at the balance sheet date comprise cash on hand and shortterm deposits net of bank overdrafts.
Investments
Investments at the balance sheet date comprise fixedterm bank deposits which have a maturity at acquisition greater than three months.
Assets held for sale A noncurrent asset is classified as held for sale if at the balance sheet date its carrying value will be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use it is available for immediate sale and that sale is highly probable within one year.
On initial classification as held for sale noncurrent assets are measured at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell with any adjustments taken to the income statement.
The same applies to gains and losses subsequent to remeasurement.
Governance Notice of meeting Strategic report Electronic Data Processing PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements Significant accounting policies continued Leasing transactions Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Deferred income Deferred income represents that portion of licence fees hosting charges and maintenance contracts taken out by customers but which relate to a future period.
Taxes
Tax on the Groups profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of prior years.
Credit is taken in the accounting period for research and development tax credits which have been claimed from HM Revenue and Customs in respect of qualifying research and development costs incurred.
Research and development tax credits are accounted for on an accruals basis depending on the level of certainty regarding acceptance of the claims.
The credit is presented in the income statement as a deduction from the current tax expense to the extent that the entity is entitled to claim the credit in the current reporting period.
Any unused credit would be recognised as a deferred tax asset if it met the general recognition criteria for deferred tax assets i. considered to be more likely than not that it will be recovered.
Deferred tax is provided on the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Employee benefits  pensions The Group operates both defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes.
The premiums relating to defined contribution schemes are charged to the income statement in the period in which they accrue.
The Groups net obligation in respect of its defined benefit pension scheme is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
That benefit is discounted to determine its present value and the fair value of the scheme assets is deducted.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
Remeasurement gains and losses arising from changes in actuarial assumptions plan experience and differences between the expected and actual return on plan assets are recognised in other comprehensive income in the statement of comprehensive income in the year in which they occur.
All other movements in the pension asset or liability are recognised in the income statement for the relevant period.
Sharebased payment transactions The Company operates a share option scheme for certain employees.
The fair value of the share options is calculated at the date of grant using a BlackScholes model.
The fair value is then recognised as an employee expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity.
Equity
The nature and purpose of each reserve included within equity is as follows Share capital The balance classified as share capital includes the nominal value on issue of the Companys equity share capital comprising 5p ordinary shares.
Share premium The balance classified as share premium represents the premium paid on the issue of the Companys equity share capital.
Capital redemption reserve The balance classified as capital redemption reserve represents the nominal value of issued share capital repurchased by the Company.
Treasury shares When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased the amount of the consideration paid which includes directly attributable costs net of any tax effects is recognised as a deduction from equity.
Repurchased shares classified as treasury shares are presented as a deduction from equity.
When treasury shares are sold or reissued subsequently the amount received is recognised as an increase in equity and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is transferred to or from retained earnings.
34 Electronic Data Processing PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued forming part of the financial statements Significant accounting policies continued Significant judgements and estimates Judgements and estimates made by the Directors in the application of these accounting policies may have a significant effect on the financial statements with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year.
The main areas of estimation and accounting judgement are
Employee benefits The calculation of the deficit or surplus on the Groups defined benefit pension scheme is based on a number of actuarial assumptions including discount rate future rate of inflation and future changes in mortality rates.
These assumptions are reviewed regularly by the Directors with the scheme actuary.
Details of the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the key actuarial assumptions are provided in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements.
Judgements
Development costs The Directors review annually the Companys software development projects and assess which of those projects qualify for capitalisation under IAS 38.
This assessment involves a project by project review of all software development undertaken during the year and an assessment is made as to whether each project involves the development of new software products or adds significant new functionality to existing software products in which case the costs are considered for capitalisation.
Costs are only capitalised once management has assessed that the future revenues which will be generated from the new or improved products will be sufficient to justify this accounting treatment.
Revenue recognition The key area of judgement in respect of revenue recognition is in determining which of its software licencing and hosting revenues should be recognised immediately and which should be deferred and recognised over time.
This includes making an assessment of the fair value of the Groups ongoing obligation to provide software and hosting support services arising from its customer contracts when determining how much revenue should be recognised over time.
Similarly the Directors make a judgement as to whether certain services provided under its hosting agreements for instance system configuration and database preparation are separate components for which revenue can be recognised upfront at a point in time when the obligation is deemed to have been fulfilled.
Financial risk management The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments credit risk liquidity risk and market risk.
This note presents material information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks the Groups objectives policies and procedures for measuring and managing risk and the Groups management of capital.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these financial statements.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and overseeing of the Groups risk management framework.
The
Groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Group through its training and management standards and procedures aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers and investments.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer and also the markets in which they operate.
The Group is not exposed through a significant volume of sales transactions with any single customer.
All new customers are reviewed before the Groups standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables on a line by line basis.
The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by only investing surplus cash in recognised UKbased banks.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group is currently debt free and has significant cash resources.
It therefore considers the risk to be low at the present time.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments.
Governance Notice of meeting Strategic report Electronic Data Processing PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements Significant accounting policies continued Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices such as foreign exchange and interest rates will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters while optimising the return.
The Group has a small number of customers based in the US who are invoiced in US dollars along with a small number of Europeanbased customers who are invoiced in euros.
As these revenues represent approximately 2% of total turnover the Group does not enter into any hedging transactions.
All other Group sales to overseas customers are denominated in sterling and therefore they do not present a foreign currency risk.
The Group does not have any significant monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operating unit involved.
As the Group has significant cash deposits changes in interest rates could have a significant impact on the Groups results.
Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base defined as total equity so as to maintain investor creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
New standards not applied The IASB has issued the following standards with an effective date after the date of these financial statements and early adoption has not been applied Effective for accounting periods beginning on or after International Accounting Standards IFRSIAS IFRS 2 amended June 2016 Sharebased Payment 1 January 2018 IFRS 4 amended September 2016 Insurance Contracts 1 January 2018 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2018 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2018 IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019 IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts 1 January 2021 IAS 7 amended January 2016 Statement of Cash Flows 1 January 2017 IAS 12 amended January 2016 Income Taxes 1 January 2017 IAS 28 amended October 2017 Longterm Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures 1 January 2019 Amendments resulting from Annual Improvements to IFRSs 20142016 Cycle 1 January 2018 IFRIC Interpretations IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration 1 January 2018 IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments 1 January 2019 Impact of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 which is applicable to the Company with effect from 1 October 2018 and will therefore be adopted in the financial statements for the year ending 30 September 2019 provides a new framework that replaces the existing revenue recognition guidance under IFRS.
The new standard requires entities to apply a fivestep model to determine when to recognise revenue and at what amount.
The model specifies that revenue should be recognised when or as an entity transfers control of goods or services to a customer at the amount to which an entity expects to be entitled.
Depending on whether certain criteria are met revenue is recognised either over time in a manner that depicts the entitys performance or at a point in time when control of the goods or services is transferred to the customer.
IFRS 15 introduces new and specific guidance on assessing whether revenue from a licence of intellectual property is recognised at a point in time or over time.
The Directors are currently reviewing the Companys standard software licences in accordance with the new guidance to determine whether they provide a right to use its intellectual property where revenue is recognised at a point in time or a right to access its intellectual property where revenue is recognised over time.
IFRS 15 also introduces comprehensive guidance on identifying separate components of a transaction.
The Directors are reviewing the Companys standard hosting agreements in accordance with this guidance to identify the distinct services promised in a hosting contract and to determine the amount of revenue and its timing that should be allocated to each of these services.
The review of the impact of applying IFRS 15 on the Companys reported results is ongoing.
Further information on the impact of the new standard on the timing of recognition of the Groups software licensing and hosting revenues will be provided in the 2018 annual report and accounts.
36 Electronic Data Processing PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued forming part of the financial statements Significant accounting policies continued Impact of other new standards and interpretations The Group has a number of operating leases and the Directors are currently assessing the impact of adopting IFRS 16 Leases on the financial statements.
It is not anticipated that application of the remaining new standards interpretations and amendments to existing standards will have a material effect on the Groups financial statements when first applied.
Segmental analysis The Group has identified its reportable segment based on the financial reports that internally are provided to the Groups chief operating decision maker CODM.
In line with its management structure the Executive Directors collectively make the key operating decisions and review internal monthly management accounts and budgets as part of this process.
Accordingly the Executive Directors collectively are considered to be the CODM.
The information reported regularly to the CODM presents the Group as a single segment supplying software and related services to customers operating in similar markets.
The Groups software products share a common sales development and implementation resource.
Consequently the Group has determined that there is one operating segment and therefore one reportable segment Software.
Segment performance is measured based on segment profit before tax excluding IAS 19 defined benefit pension scheme adjustments and profits or losses on property disposals or revaluations.

Employee benefits  pensions The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
Defined contribution pension schemes The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes the principal scheme being a grouped personal pension scheme through an insurance company.
The pension costs of these arrangements were 73000 2016 75000.
Outstanding contributions at the end of the year were 13000 2016 13000.
Governance Notice of meeting Strategic report Electronic Data Processing PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements Employee benefits  pensions continued Defined benefit pension scheme The Group sponsors the Electronic Data Processing PLC Pension and Life Assurance Scheme which is a funded defined benefit arrangement.
This is a separate trustee administered fund holding the pension scheme assets to meet longterm pension liabilities for the members.
The scheme entitles a retired member to receive an annual pension equal to 160 of final salary for each year of service that the member provided.
The scheme closed to future accrual on 31 August 2014.
The scheme exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as investment risk interest rate risk and longevity risk.
A decrease in corporate bond yields a rise in inflation or an increase in life expectancy would result in an increase to scheme liabilities.
This would detrimentally impact the balance sheet position and may give rise to increased charges in future income statements.
The last full actuarial valuation of the scheme was performed at 31 July 2016 by a professionally qualified actuary.
This scheme funding valuation showed a deficit of 70000 at that date.
The full actuarial valuation of the Scheme was updated on an IAS 19 basis at 30 September 2017 by JLT Benefit Solutions Limited using the following assumptionstel Inflation rate 2.3% 2.1% 2.2% Discount rate 2.6% 2.2% 3.7% Expected return on assets 2.6% 2.2% 3.7% Rate of increase of pensions in payment 5.0% 5.0% 5.0% Rate of increase for deferred pensioners 2.3% 2.1% 2.2% The discount rate assumption has been set to equal a single discount rate which when used to discount the projected benefit cash flows underlying a pension scheme with a 17year duration would give broadly the same result as using a full AA corporate bond yield curve to discount the same cash flows.
The Schemes assets are invested in insurance policies in which the underlying assets comprise wholly of corporate bonds and the expected return on assets is based on the yield available on AArated corporate bonds.
The mortality assumptions adopted at 30 September 2017 are 100% of the standard tables S1PMA males and S1PFA females.
These imply the following life expectancies 2017 2016 Years Years Retiring in 2017 aged 65 years Males 22.1 22.1 Females 23.9 24.4 Retiring in 2037 currently aged 45 years Males 23.5 23.8 Females 25.4 26.3 46 Electronic Data Processing PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued forming part of the financial statements Employee benefits  pensions continued Funding statustel Present value of Scheme obligations 10824 11633 9374 Fair value of Scheme assets 11064 7750 7109 Surplusdeficit 240 3883 2265 The Company has reviewed the guidance provided by IFRIC 14 and has concluded that it is not necessary to make any adjustment to the IAS 19 results in respect of an asset ceiling or Minimum Funding Requirement as at 30 September 2017.

Governance Notice of meeting Strategic report Electronic Data Processing PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements Accounting policies continued Intangible fixed assets continued Research and development Expenditure on research activities undertaken with the prospect of gaining new technical knowledge and understanding is recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes.
Development expenditure is capitalised only if development costs can be measured reliably the product or process is technically and commercially feasible future economic benefits are probable and the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete development and to use or sell the asset.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials direct labour and overheads that are directly attributable to preparing the asset for its intended use.
Other development expenditure not meeting these criteria is recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Capitalised development expenditure is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation is based on the cost of an asset less its residual value.
Capitalised software development costs are amortised over a period of between three and seven years on a straight line basis and amortised from the time the asset becomes available for use.
Stock
Inventories are valued at the lower of purchase cost and net realisable value.
Trade and other debtors Trade debts which generally have terms of up to 30 days are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectable amounts.
Provision is made where there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect part or all of a debt.
Bad debts are written off as identified.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents at the balance sheet date comprise cash on hand and shortterm deposits net of bank overdrafts.
Current asset investments Current asset investments at the balance sheet date comprise fixedterm bank deposits which have a maturity at acquisition greater than three months.
Assets held for sale A noncurrent asset is classified as held for sale if at the balance sheet date its carrying value will be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use it is available for immediate sale and that sale is highly probable within one year.
On initial classification as held for sale noncurrent assets are measured at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell with any adjustments taken to the income statement.
The same applies to gains and losses subsequent to remeasurement.
Leasing transactions Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Deferred income Deferred income represents that portion of licence fees hosting charges and maintenance contracts taken out by customers but which relate to a future period.
Taxes
Tax on the Companys profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of prior years.
Credit is taken in the accounting period for research and development tax credits which have been claimed from HM Revenue and Customs in respect of qualifying research and development costs incurred.
Research and development tax credits are accounted for on an accruals basis depending on the level of certainty regarding acceptance of the claims.
The credit is presented in profit or loss as a deduction from the current tax expense to the extent that the entity is entitled to claim the credit in the current reporting period.
Any unused credit would be recognised as a deferred tax asset if it met the general recognition criteria for deferred tax assets i. to be more likely than not that it will be recovered.
Deferred tax is provided on the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.

The Company operates both defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes.
The premiums relating to defined contribution schemes are charged to the income statement in the period in which they accrue.
The Companys net obligation in respect of its defined benefit pension scheme is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
That benefit is discounted to determine its present value and the fair value of the scheme assets is deducted.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
Remeasurement gains and losses arising from changes in actuarial assumptions plan experience and differences between the expected and actual return on plan assets are recognised in other comprehensive income in the statement of comprehensive income in the year in which they occur.
All other movements in the pension asset or liability are recognised in the income statement for the relevant period.
Equity
The nature and purpose of each reserve included within equity is as follows Share capital The balance classified as share capital includes the nominal value on issue of the Companys equity share capital comprising 5p ordinary shares.
Share premium The balance classified as share premium represents the premium paid on the issue of the Companys equity share capital.
Capital redemption reserve The balance classified as capital redemption reserve represents the nominal value of issued share capital repurchased by the Company.
Treasury shares When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased the amount of the consideration paid which includes directly attributable costs net of any tax effects is recognised as a deduction from equity.
Repurchased shares classified as treasury shares are presented as a deduction from equity.
When treasury shares are sold or reissued subsequently the amount received is recognised as an increase in equity and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is transferred to or from retained earnings.
Significant judgements and estimates Judgements and estimates made by the Directors in the application of these accounting policies may have a significant effect on the financial statements with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year.
The main areas of estimation and accounting judgement are
Employee benefits The calculation of the deficit or surplus on the Groups defined benefit pension scheme is based on a number of actuarial assumptions including discount rate future rate of inflation and future changes in mortality rates.
These assumptions are reviewed regularly by the Directors with the scheme actuary.
Details of the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the key actuarial assumptions are provided in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements.
Judgements
Development costs The Directors review annually the Companys software development projects and assess which of those projects qualify for capitalisation under IAS 38.
This assessment involves a project by project review of all software development undertaken during the year and an assessment is made as to whether each project involves the development of new software products or adds significant new functionality to existing software products in which case the costs are considered for capitalisation.
Costs are only capitalised once management have assessed that the future revenues which will be generated from the new or improved products will be sufficient to justify this accounting treatment.
Revenue recognition The key area of judgement in respect of revenue recognition is in determining which of its software licencing and hosting revenues should be recognised immediately and which should be deferred and recognised over time.
This includes making an assessment of the fair value of the Groups ongoing obligation to provide software and hosting support services arising from its customer contracts when determining how much revenue should be recognised over time.
Similarly the Directors make a judgement as to whether certain services provided under its hosting agreements for instance system configuration and database preparation are separate components for which revenue can be recognised upfront at a point in time when the obligation is deemed to have been fulfilled.
