CHAIRMANS STATEMENT
Financial results Group revenue for the year ended 31 March 2017 increased by 7 per cent. improved on the prior year by 8 per cent to 6.19m 2016 5.73m.
The results over the past year have seen lower than expected performance at a Group level.
The investment in staff training and development and the introduction of a new CRM system will enhance the results going forward but had a direct effect on the Group results to March 2017.
Whilst organic growth in the short to medium term will serve the business well for the business to meet our longterm objectives the Board also continues to focus on identifying suitable businesses to join the Group to enhance profitability add new service lines and geographies.
Strategy
Nakama Groups strategy has continued to concentrate on providing staffing solutions with two highly specialised businesses Nakama within the digital creative media marketing and technology sectors and the UK business within the financial services sector.
The approach focuses on delivering a local regional and global solution.
The business continues to maintain this as fundamental but will look to broaden the service offerings across the Group with an emphasis on providing digital solutions to clients across recruitment outsourcing on site and consultancy through the use of technology.
It is the strategy of the Board and management team to be a leading international specialist within staffing delivering a quality service to our customers and candidates whilst creating a sustainable business for the longterm benefit of all stakeholders.
The management team has stabilized over the past year and is now in a position to focus on delivering value to clients and shareholders going forward.
We continue to look to recruit further excellent driven individuals to meet our client and candidate needs.
There are currently no new offices planned for the next financial year as the Board intends to concentrate on improving the performance of the current operations.
Executives and staff The Group retains a strong team of very knowledgeable and long serving staff and we look forward to continuing to build the Nakama
The Board would like to acknowledge the loyalty and commitment of all the staff to the Group and we are extremely grateful for their efforts.
Again we extend a very warm welcome to all new members of the team.
Outlook
Trading in the first quarter has been in line with expectations.
Whilst the market sectors in which Nakama operates are in high demand the business needs stable local economies in the current trading locations stability in current staff numbers and the continued hiring of new sales staff to deliver against less specialised but much larger competitors.
The Board looks to 2018 as a year in which the Group will seek to grow organically and review other options to grow in terms of net fee income and profit.

Revenue 22519 21043 NFI Net fee income 6193 5739 EBITDA  25 257 Operating lossprofit for the financial year 211 37 Lossprofit for the financial year before tax 270 Net current assets 720 902 Equity 1414 1796 Lossprofit per share 0.25p 0.13p EBITDA  Earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation Group revenue for the year ended 31 March 2017 increased by 7 per cent. improved on the prior year by 8 per cent to 6.19m 2016 5.73m.
The
NFI percentage has increased to 27.5 per cent.
2016 27.3 per cent.
APAC revenue increased to 8.82M from 6.92m last year.
In the same period revenues in the UK decreased from 14.1m to 13.7m mainly due to a slowdown in the contractor market.
EBITDA was 25000 for the year 2016 257000 mainly as a result of a slowdown in the UK market and continued investment into the USA a market entered into for the first time last year.
Although revenue grew in APAC the continued investment in training and technology meant that the region made a loss for the year.
The region has been through a year of restructuring and it is now in a position to grow the bottom line going forward.
The yearend balance sheet showed borrowings increase from 1.2m to 1.5m to help fund the increase in revenue.
This also had the effect of increasing the year end trade receivables to 3.9m 20163.4m.
There was an operating loss for the year of 211000 2016 profit of 37000.
The Directors are not recommending the payment of a dividend for the year but resumption of dividend payments will be kept under review.
The 2017 result shows that we have maintained staff levels at 80 after a period of attrition during the year.
Our clients need to feel confident before making a permanent or contract hire and political events during the last financial year including Brexit and the US presidential election caused a slowdown in decision making in some sectors.
UK operations UK operations continue to see existing markets come under pressure from inhouse recruitment and externally managed service providers.
The UK business was restructured from a service provision and operational standpoint in Q3 last year.
Headcount remained stable but the business did not meet its hiring targets internally.
Over the last year the market has become more heavily brokered and fragmented and the ability to generate value in traditional digital sectors has been eroded.
In response to this Nakama London has continued to increase its capacity to deliver within the expanding data and analytics markets across both corporate and agency clients.
The data and analytics service line is complementary and relevant to the existing client base both within the UK and globally.
Margins and rates are healthy in this sector and senior level candidates and clients are suited to the consultative and proactive approach to recruitment that is at the core of Nakamas delivery.
The business will look to grow its capabilities in this area whilst continuing to look at the implementation of technology to create efficiency and higher margins through the automation of lower value work.

The UK financial services sector experienced a tougher environment with Recruitment Process Outsourcing RPO challenges affecting contract margins within the sector.
Overall there has been an increase in permanent billings with demand for mid and senior level hires.
The UK general insurance market saw increased competition by RPO companies impacting on contract delivery and margins.
The focus for Highams is on the business analystproduct and transformation markets within insurance as that is where we see the growth.
During the year there have been new technology platform programmes and digital distribution activity requiring specialist skills.
Regulatory legislation in insurance wealth management and pensions is a necessary requirement and demand for skills in this area has been steady.
APAC operations Operating conditions across the APAC region remain similar to the previous year.
A mix of economic environments financial periods and local cultures can prove challenging.
We continue to address this by ensuring that businesses focus on servicing high value verticals in their current markets.
All businesses have continued to drive retained services and consultancy offerings relevant to their markets.
We have a key focus on training and development so that the right skills are developed along with an onboarding and talent attraction programme to ensure that the business attracts and retains the right talent in an increasingly competitive market.
External competition is increasing and it is still Nakamas key objective to invest in and build a strong management team to enable us to continue to pursue a consistent and clear strategy in multiple markets in line with the Groups vision.
The APAC offices have again experienced an increase in turnover.
This has yielded a 27% increase in revenue to 8.82m compared to 6.92m last year.
However investment in training and technology in the region during the year in order to future proof the business meant that the region made a loss this year of 20000 compared to a profit of 189000 last year.
The economic outlook in APAC is stable and the economy is in growth mode.
Hiring restrictions in the Australian markets due to changes in legislation will put pressure on salaries and attracting consultants to the business.
It is likely to have an ongoing effect on the permanent hiring outlook within Australia. analytics data digital and transformation.
Traditional non digital businesses have taken or started to undertake wholesale reviews of where to position themselves.
There has been an appetite for the range of human resource consultancy services that Nakama is starting to provide in the region and we see this as an essential differentiator of Nakamas product offering going forward.
Projects are being adopted by organisations across many industries which are driving demand for digital skills a high proportion of which are not in the local market.
Clients are focusing on a customer first digital strategy involving service and product design the strengthening of their data and big data and analytics functions and we are continuing to see clients evolve their digital customer acquisition strategies.
The business has seen demand from the traditional consultancies that are now pursuing digital strategies to compete with the traditional advertising networks.
In the new gig economy talent is increasingly more mobile than ever before and businesses are continuing to adapt to having more flexible staffing solutions.
This is evident in the Asian markets where the contracting market has started to move from low value low skill to high value high skill within our sectors.
The client base across our APAC businesses has seen the business become more involved with corporate clients whilst continuing to service the advertising and digital agency businesses.

4 04082017 101225 25474.04  4 August 2017 1012 AM  Proof 7 We continue to leverage our global networks to deliver against these demands.
We see a natural cap on the Australian market due to its size and location but we still feel that the market has a high level of growth over the next financial year specifically around the range of onsite and consultancy services Nakama is providing.
The Asia businesses have continued to add revenue despite a mixed year where we saw changes and challenges in the South East Asia market.
They have also been key in the introduction of new business across the wider region.
Singapore focuses on the South East Asian corridor into Malaysia and Thailand with Hong Kong continuing to build market share and experiencing high demand from China and the wider region.
The businesses benefit from a collaborative approach to business development and creating opportunity throughout the region based on this approach.
We see the growth of both these business units as essential to our strategy within the region.
All the APAC businesses continue to have a healthy balance of repeat business based on the areas of specialisation new service lines and expertise within the local and increasingly global markets.
The market continues to be competitive the businesses have seen a higher than expected turnover of staff this year in our South East Asia market and one of the Australian businesses and finding good quality candidates is difficult.
The business has addressed this by refocusing its internal talent acquisition strategy and approach across all regions.
The business does benefit from having global operations and is focused on a sector that is in high demand which has been beneficial to attracting staff from a variety of industries and locations.
The factors to success in APAC continue to remain similar to last year increased competition a highly mobile workforce that is increasingly looking for change overcoming language barriers restrictions on hiring staff in regions due to changes in legislation and financial constraints have the potential to force business costs to unsustainable levels and prevent businesses being able to hire.
Retaining high performing staff is critical and ensuring the business creates high performing staff in all regions is a key area of focus.
The skillsets the business is looking to attract to deliver on the group strategy will add value to the group as a whole both regionally and globally.
We maintain our outlook that a strong understanding of local and global technology digital and consultancy markets and our ability to work across these from a local regional and global perspective is essential in achieving the growth we seek and delivering to our shareholders.

REPORT
The directors present their strategic report together with the audited financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017.
Business model The Group provides recruitment services and solutions to its specialist niche market clients in global geographical locations where there is both growing demand and a skills shortage.
Recruitment services include permanent staff placements and contract staff placed on a fixed term assignment.
The UK is represented by two UK offices the Nakama brand operating from London and the Highams brand operating from Caterham.
We work closely together to explore opportunities to crosssell services into our respective client bases.
APAC is represented by two Nakama offices in Australia one in Hong Kong and an office in Singapore.
We serve digital media markets across a broad spectrum of clients ranging from corporates to digital marketing agencies.
Last year we opened an office in New York in order to increase the global footprint of the Group.
Strategy
At Nakama were in the business of people solutions and consultancy.
And OUR VISION is to be the best people business on the planet.
OUR WHY  ultimately its people who transform improve and grow business.
OUR HOW  Specialisation Technology Network  all with the right people.
OUR WHAT Recruitment  permanent and contract
Outsourcing and RPO Project Management Research and insights Consultancy  change management people development EVP etc.
Software solutions  apps. talent payroll etc.
Education training and learning We aim to target those sectors where we can secure profitable business and where we can differentiate ourselves from our competitors by providing a bespoke and specialist quality service and can deliver incremental value to our clients to assist them in managing their businesses.
Our increasing ability to crosssell our service to our international clients is also key to our strategic ambition to become The Global Specialist Recruitment Business.
The Groups target market remains the same but the scope of its geographical spread has expanded over the years The group is also keenly focused on the implementation and investment of technology services to create higher margins through increased efficiency across the group and the potential of reselling these solutions to future clients.
A focus on core partnerships globally over the next 12 months will also position the business into a higher value margin market.
By sourcing candidates through our global network we can track specialists by using real time data.
We have been able to focus our efforts on building Talent Communities through recommendations referrals local advertising and highly specialised peer groups.
Each
Nakama office has a local and regional talent pool which in aggregate combines to create an international talent pool.
We have the ability to build self generating communities in this way.
We have a number of social media channels and forums that we use to identify local talent looking to relocate internationally.
These avenues are typically established in line with the specialisation for which we are recruiting across local regions and via our global footprint.
Linkedin Twitter Facebook and Instagram are a few of the channels we currently utilise.
This approach gives operational staff a full view of the businesses we are involved with and access to global client and talent lists.
As such we will continue to focus on hiring and developing our salesforce to enable them to perform in their local markets.
Our vision for the long term is to continue building head count and gaining critical mass in our current markets and to expand and establish more international offices.
By doing so we believe we will be well placed to leverage off our niche specialisations and our international footprint to better drive Group profitability.

Staff costs as a percentage of NFI has increased slightly as a result of an investment in training and development.

Key financial risks of the Group Details of the Groups financial instruments are given in note 20 to the Group financial statements.
Principal risks and uncertainties of the Group The Board continuously monitors the key risks and uncertainties that may impact the business and the ability to deliver our strategy.
These are identified below
The business has undergone a review over the past 12 months with a key focus on better performance and an increase in the skills of the staff.
This has been across all regions of the business.
In a service company it is essential to maintain client relationships and build new business.
It is important that high quality staff are recruited and retained.
It is however of equal importance that all staff contribute to the profitability of the business.
The use of appropriate incentives focused training and a challenging and supportive environment all work to this end.
As opportunities grow we offer the potential for staff to relocate to any of our offices and experience different cultures and to enhance their position in the Group.
We recognise that staff retention is vital to our operation especially in our sector.
We continue to recruit new staff both experienced and nonexperienced to ensure that we mitigate any reliance on key individuals and nurture our own sales consultants.
Office locations Nakama has offices in the UK 2 Australia 2 Hong Kong Singapore and New York.
It is essential that we examine each of our locations for risks of performance and the operations management of these offices ensuring we are aware of local laws and culture and can secure licences for the employment of our own staff and those of our placements at clients.
We continue to recruit new staff to increase the number of consultants to ensure that we are not reliant on key individuals.
Competition
There are many competing recruitment organisations and Recruitment Process Outsourcing RPO companies.
The changing social media world also creates competition companies now having moved towards inhouse recruitment models continue to drive down margins in sectors that have become more commoditised.
Nakama has continued to refine the business focus on highly specialised digital and technology sectors and continue to work with internal recruiters and staffing teams as the specialist agency to support the specific skills needed with its speed of delivery.
Nakama maintains and enhances its niche market approach in order to continue to differentiate itself from its competitors.
Competition remains robust and was previously mainly from local SME based businesses but we have now seen more traditional IT businesses compete in the digital space.
Competitors are now starting to look closely at the markets we operate in.
We have seen a small increase in competition which operates along some of Nakamas service lines within our markets.
It is also the case that we have seen some traditional competitors in local markets cease trading due to lack of scale and reach.
Our ability to remain specialised within the digital technology creative and marketing industry locally and globally continues to provide a significant competitive advantage.
Online recruitingother competition This is an increasingly competitive space and whilst we have seen new service offerings enter the market we have not seen much impact to date.
We differentiate ourselves by being highly specialised delivering a solution to clients issues globally.
We have a reputation for providing quality onsite and embedded solutions industry expertise and for being a valued partner.
Not only are the local and global recruitment markets becoming increasingly saturated with agencies but also internal teams are taking on the recruitment process.
Businesses operating with a transactional recruitment approach of simply sending CVs to a job are increasingly unable to compete.
The demand for speed of service high quality and the delivery of niche talent is more important than ever.
Both clients and candidates demand more and will engage with recruitment partners who really understand their business and requirements and offer a premium service.
Clients
Clients may choose not to continue to use Nakamas services if our service fails to meet the required standards.
It is therefore essential to harness technology to deliver rapid solutions.
We are committed to ensuring the delivery of high standards and to retaining our excellent relationship with clients.
Candidates
Nakamas ability to work in niche high demand sectors has continued to provide a key reason for candidates to want to be represented by the
The quality of support services around payroll job registration job search and information will be a key factor to retaining and increasing Nakamas talent pools globally.
Nakama continues to increase its networks and knowledge about their niche business and technical areas by developing a network of clients contractors and applicants relevant to that niche.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2017 Nature of operations and general information Nakama Group includes Nakama a global recruitment consultancy for the digital technology and interactive media industry and also Highams a technology and business information recruitment consultancy for the insurance and investment management industry.
Nakama Group plc a public limited company is the Groups ultimate parent company.
It is registered in England and Wales.
The address of Nakama Group plcs registered office which is also its principal place of business is Quadrant House 3345 Croydon Road Caterham Surrey CR3 6PB.
The details of subsidiary undertakings are listed in note 5 to the Company Financial Statements.
Nakama Group plcs shares are listed on the London Stock Exchanges Alternative Investment Market AIM.
Nakama Group plcs consolidated full year financial statements are presented in British pounds  which is also the functional currency of the ultimate parent company.
Accounting policies Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the EU and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies preparing their accounts under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
The principal accounting policies of the group are set out below.
The accounting policies that have been applied in the opening statement of financial position have also been applied throughout all periods presented in these financial statements.
The areas where significant judgements and estimates have been made in preparing the financial statements and their effect are disclosed in note 3.
Going concern The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
As at 31 March 2017 the Group had net assets of 1414000 2016 1796000 and made a loss for the year of 352000 2016 loss of 70000.
In considering the appropriateness of the going concern assumption the Directors have taken into consideration Monthly operating and cash flow forecasts and Facilities available to the Group.
The Group has funding arrangements with its principal bankers linked to receivables which are on a revolving basis.
The cash flow forecasts are based on historical results taking in to account a small level of growth for those subsidiaries that are in their early years of trading.
The current economic conditions and competition in the market create uncertainty over the level of placements and the forecasts take account for possible changes in trading performance but with regular income on contractor payments all the funding arrangements in place give us the opportunity to grow the contract base within the headroom of the facility adjusting where required.
The Directors are therefore confident that the Group will be able to continue as a going concern.
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 March 2017.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Company controls a subsidiary if all three of the following elements are present power over the subsidiary exposure to variable returns from the subsidiary and the ability of the investor to use its power to affect those variable returns.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Business combinations Business combinations of subsidiaries are dealt with by the purchase method.
The equity method involves the recognition at fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities including contingent liabilities of the subsidiary at the acquisition date regardless of whether or not they were recorded in the financial statements of the subsidiary prior to acquisition.
On initial recognition the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary are included in the consolidated statement of financial position at their fair values which are also used as the basis for subsequent measurement in accordance with the Group accounting policies.
Goodwill is stated after separating out identifiable intangible assets.
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Direct costs of acquisition are recognised immediately as an expense.

Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable for services provided during the accounting period net of trade discounts and value added tax.
Revenue in respect of contract placements is recognised in the period in which the contractor undertakes the work.
Revenue in respect of permanent placements is recognised in the period in which a candidate commences employment.
A provision is made against any potential rebates that may become due on permanent placements should the employee leave within a specified period of time.
These provisions are reversed once this period has expired.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents any excess of the cost of a business combination over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired for acquisitions after 31 March 2006 together with goodwill recognised on transition to IFRS on 1 April 2006.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Other intangible assets Computer software included at cost is amortised on a straight line basis over its useful economic life of two years.
Intangible assets are recognised on business combinations if they are separable from the acquired entity or give rise to other contractuallegal rights.
The amounts ascribed to such intangibles are arrived at by using appropriate valuation techniques.
Identified intangible assets comprise of customer relationships and candidate database which are amortised over a six and fiveyear period respectively.
Property plant and equipment Property plant and equipment are stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual value of property plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives at the following rates Leasehold improvements  over remaining period of lease on a straightline basis Computer equipment  50% per annum on a straightline basis Furniture fittings and office equipment  25% per annum on a straightline basis Impairment testing of goodwill other intangible assets and property plant and equipment Impairment tests on intangible assets with indefinite useful economic lives are undertaken annually on 31 March.
Other nonfinancial assets are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount the asset is written down immediately to its recoverable amount.
Leased assets Rentals under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straightline basis over the lease term.
All of the Groups current leases are operating leases.
Taxation
Current tax is the tax currently payable based on taxable profit for the year.
Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the tax authorities.
The tax rates and the tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the statement of financial position differs to its tax base except for differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill and the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit.
Deferred tax assets are recognised in the statement of financial position only where it is probable that suitable taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised.
Deferred taxation is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset is realised or the liability is settled based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the statement of financial position date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of unsettled monetary assets and liabilities are recognised immediately in the income statement.
On consolidation the results of overseas operations are translated into sterling at rates approximating to those ruling when the transactions took place.
All assets and liabilities of overseas operations are translated at rates of exchange ruling on the statement of financial position date.
Exchange differences arising from this policy are recognised directly in the currency reserve via other comprehensive income.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption in IFRS 1 and has deemed cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations to be nil at the date of transition to IFRS.
The gain or loss on disposal of these operations excludes translation differences that arose before the date of transition to IFRS and includes later translation differences.
Pension costs The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme.
The pension cost expensed to the income statement represents contributions payable by the Group to the pension scheme in the period.
Financial assets All of the Groups financial assets are categorised as loans and receivables.
The Groups financial assets comprise trade receivables cash and cash equivalents.
Trade and other receivables are measured initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit and loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired such as significant financial difficulties on the part of the counterparty or default or significant delay in payment that the Group will be unable to collect all of the amounts due under the terms receivable the amount of such a provision being the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future expected cash flows associated with the impaired receivable.
For trade receivables which are reported net such provisions are recorded in a separate allowance account with the loss being recognised within administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
On confirmation that the trade receivable will not be collectable the gross carrying value of the asset is written off against the associated provision.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are obligations to pay cash or other financial assets and are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Groups financial liabilities comprise trade payables other payables and an interest bearing confidential invoice discounting facility.
All financial liabilities are measured initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and  for the purpose of the statement of cash flows  bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts are shown within loans and borrowings in the current liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial position.
Employee share benefit trust The cost of the Companys shares held by the employee share benefit trust is deducted from equity in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Any gain or loss received by the employee share benefit trust on disposal of the shares it holds is also recognised directly in equity.
Other
Any shares held by the employee share benefit trust are treated as cancelled for the purposes of calculating earnings per share.
Share based payments Where share options are awarded to employees the fair value of the options at the date of grant is charged to the income statement over the vesting period.
Nonmarket vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each statement of financial position date so that ultimately the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of options that eventually vest.
Market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the options granted.
As long as all other vesting conditions are satisfied a charge is made irrespective of whether the market vesting conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms and conditions of options are modified before they vest the increase in the fair value of the options measured immediately before and after the modification is also charged to the income statement over the remaining vesting period.

New standards interpretations and amendments effective from 1 April 2016 The new standards interpretations and amendments effective from 1 April 2016 have not had a material effect to the financial statements.
Standards and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not yet been adopted by the Group The amendments and interpretations to published standards that have an effective date for accounting periods on or after 31 March 2017 or later periods have not been adopted early by the Group and assessment of the impact of these standards is currently under review.
International Accounting Standards IASIFRS Effective date IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 16 Leases Critical accounting judgements and estimates In preparing the financial statements it is necessary for the Directors to make estimates and judgements about the future.
The key assumption made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements this year concerns the consideration of deferred tax asset.
The Group has again made profits before depreciation and amortisation and is able to relieve some of its losses in determining its current tax payable for the year which is why it is anticipated there will be no current tax liability.
Furthermore because the Directors are confident of continued profitability it is still considered appropriate to recognise a deferred tax asset for the future relief of the Groups remaining losses with the amount recognised based on formalised budgets.
However the actual amount of losses that will be relieved in future will be driven by the Groups actual profitability including periods beyond those for which formal budgets are prepared and therefore the amount of the deferred tax asset recognised this year may be greater or smaller than the actual benefit accruing to the Group.
Details of the Groups provided and unprovided deferred tax position are shown in notes 9 and 18.
The Group is required to test on an annual basis whether goodwill has suffered any impairment see note 12.
The recoverable amount is determined based on value in use calculations.
The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows and the choice of a discount rate in order to calculate the present value of the cash flows.
Actual outcomes may vary.
Operating segments Operating segments are reported on a geographical basis.
The Group has three main reportable segments based on the location revenue is derived from Asia Pacific  This segment includes Australia Hong Kong and Singapore.
UK  The UK segment includes candidates placed in the UK and Europe.

The Goodwill arose on the acquisition of Nakama Group in October 2011.
The business formed part of the Group with effect from the date of acquisition of Nakama offices in London Australia and Hong Kong.
The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to the cash generating units CGUs as follows
2017 and 2016 Nakama London 255 Nakama Hong Kong 28 Nakama Sydney 168 Nakama Melbourne 36 The Group is required to test on an annual basis whether goodwill has suffered any impairment.
Impairment tests are undertaken annually on 31 March using value in use calculations for each CGU.
The value in use calculations are based on cash flow projections from formally approved budgets covering a five year period plus a terminal value.
The key assumptions within the calculations are considered to be revenue growth and the discount rate.
The average revenue growth rate is 32% in the next financial year 2016 30% and 5% per annum thereafter 2016 6%.
The large revenue growth rate in the next financial year is based on historical staff performance a more focused strategy new business from new hires and a more diversified portfolio of offerings.
The discount rate used in the impairment review was 12% 2016 12%.
The recoverable amount calculated for all CGUs exceeds the carrying amounts by 6223000 2016 2447001.
If any one of the following changes were made to the above key assumptions the carrying amount and recoverable amount would be equal If the revenue growth rate for the first year reduced by 33.05% to 107.1% for Nakama Melbourne If the revenue growth rate for the first year of 5.5% reduced to 3.7% for Nakama London NAKAMA GROUP PLC STOCK CODE NAK ANNUAL REPORT and FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017 Nakama Group AR 2017 Proof 7.

Financial risk management objectives and policies Financial instruments The Group uses various financial instruments these include cash and cash equivalents and various items such as trade receivables trade payables that arise directly from its operations and an invoice discounting arrangement.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Companys operations.
The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are interest rate risk liquidity risk credit risk and currency risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profit bank borrowings and invoice discounting.
The Group borrows in Pounds Sterling and Australian Dollars through the invoice discounting facility.
Cash deposits are noninterest bearing unless placed on money markets at overnight rates.
The overdraft balances are offset against cash deposits in accordance with the facility and is managed such that no interest cost is incurred.
The invoice discounting facilities are charged at 1.5% above the UK base rate for Sterling and Euro borrowing and 1% above base on the Australian facility.
The Group is therefore exposed to changes in interest rates primarily through its invoice discounting facility.
Liquidity risk The Group manages its liquidity needs by carefully monitoring cash outflows due in daytoday business.
Liquidity needs are monitored in various time bands including on a daytoday and weektoweek basis as well as on a monthly basis.
As at 31 March 2017 all of the Groups financial liabilities are contractually due within six months of the statement of financial position date.
The majority of working capital is provided through the invoice discounting facility additional draw down of these payments are directly related to the trade receivables.
The Groups liquidity needs are assessed periodically.
Capital management policies and procedures The Groups capital management objectives are to ensure the Groups ability to continue as a going concern and to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing its offerings commensurately with the level of risk.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the carrying amount of equity less cash and cash equivalents as presented on the face of the statement of financial position.
Capital for the reporting years under review is summarised on the next page.
Although Nakama Group plc is not constrained by any externally imposed capital requirements its goal is to maximise its capital to overall financing structure ratio.

The change in the capital to overall financing ratio this year is due to the loss sustained in the year and the increased usage of the invoice financing facility.
Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash deposits and trade receivables.
Risks associated with cash deposits are low as they are held at banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The principal credit risk lies with trade receivables.
In order to manage credit risk the directors set limits for customers based on a combination of payment history and third party credit references.
Credit limits are reviewed on a regular basis in conjunction with debt ageing and collection history.
The Group has historically not suffered from significant bad debt problems.
The Groups principal bankers are HSBC Bank plc the Groups invoice discounting facility is also held with HSBC Commercial Finance.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2017 Principal accounting policies Basis of preparation The parent company financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention.
The particular accounting policies adopted are described below.
Application of FRS 100 and 101 The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 100 Application of Financial Reporting Requirements FRS 100 and Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101.
Disclosure exemptions adopted In preparing these financial statements the Company has taken advantage of all disclosure exemptions conferred by FRS 101 therefore these financial statements do not include certain comparative information as otherwise required by EU endorsed IFRS certain disclosures regarding the Companys capital a statement of cash flows the effect of future accounting standards not yet adopted the disclosure of the remuneration of key management personnel and disclosure of related party transactions with wholly owned members of Nakama Group plc group of companies.
In addition and in accordance with FRS 101 further disclosure exemptions have been adopted because equivalent disclosures are included in the Companys consolidated financial statements.
These financial statements do not include certain disclosures in respect of share based payments financial instruments and fair value measurement other than certain disclosures required as a result of recording financial instruments at fair value.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost net of depreciation and provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets at rates calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset over its expected useful life as follows Leasehold improvements over period of lease Computer equipment 50% on cost per annum Furniture fittings and office equipment  25% on cost per annum Motor vehicles 25% on written down value per annum
Investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
Leased assets Rentals payable under operating leases being leases which do not result in the transfer to the Company of substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets are charged to the profit and loss on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Current taxation Current taxation represents corporation tax payable on the taxable profits for the year or prior periods and is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the statement of financial position differs from its tax base except for differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit and NAKAMA GROUP PLC STOCK CODE NAK ANNUAL REPORT and FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017 Nakama Group AR 2017 Proof 7.

Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the difference can be utilised.
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilitiesassets are settledrecovered.
Share based payments Where share options are awarded to employees the fair value of the options at the date of grant is charged to the profit and loss over the vesting period.
Nonmarket vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each statement of financial position date so that ultimately the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of options that eventually vest.
Market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the options granted.
As long as all other vesting conditions are satisfied a charge is made irrespective of whether the market vesting conditions are satisfied.
The cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to achieve a market vesting condition.
Where the terms and conditions of options are modified before they vest the increase in the fair value of the options measured immediately before and after the modification is also charged to the profit and loss over the remaining vesting period.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the time of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the statement of financial position date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date or if appropriate at the forward contract rate.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the profit and loss.
Financial guarantee contracts Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts and guarantees the indebtedness of other companies within the Group the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such.
In this respect the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time that it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Critical accounting judgements and estimates In preparing the financial statements it is necessary for the Directors to make estimates and judgements about the future.
The key assumptions made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements this year concern the value of the investmens and intercompany balances in the financial statements.
The Group is required to consider on an annual basis whether there are indications of impairments over investments and whether the intercompany receivables are recoverable.
For the investments the Directors considered there to be indications of impairment as some of the subsidiaries are loss making and as such have performed an impairment review.
The recoverable amount is determined based on value in use calculations.
The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows and the choice of a discount rate in order to calculate the present value of the cash flows.
For the receivables the budgets for the next five years are reviewed.
Directors remuneration Directors remuneration has been disclosed within the directors remuneration report and note 7 of the Group financial statements.
