5 27042018 2029 6 Sportech PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Business Model and Strategy In some cases this might be through the expansion of the Venues network in Connecticut where there are 16 existing sites with a licence to expand to 24 and through the expansion of the intrastate web and mobile parimutuel betting channels in Connecticut.
The Group seeks to broaden the product offering and become a betting operator able to offer the full suite of gaming products as regulation develops in an omnichannel environment including at venues where bets can be placed watching sport eating and drinking.
The Group has an international focus with the majority of operations in USA Connecticut New Jersey Georgia Canada Toronto Ireland and United Kingdom Bristol.
The majority of the Groups underlying earnings are now in USD followed by GBP.
The Group does not hedge against its USD earnings but will report translation differences.
The Groups strategy is to focus on fully regulated sports betting opportunities.
In the past these have been primarily parimutuel in nature.
The Group is now pursuing opportunities to leverage existing gaming licences technologies and customer relationships to achieve longterm tangible shareholder returns.

The Divisions proprietary Quantum System software which is extensively used by many of the worlds tote operators and its Global Quantum Data and Operations Centre keystone of a global service delivery network together form the foundation from which Sportech pursues key initiatives including international expansion growth in global commingling and the extension of digital technologies crucial to longterm reduction in capital and operational costs.
Included within Racing and Digital is the nascent Bump 5050 business.
Acquired in June 2014 Bump supplies instadia and beginning in 2017 online electronic lotteries to some of North Americas best known major league sports teams and entertainment venues.
Bump 5050 strategy calls for continued aggressive customer acquisition activities and leveraging of online and mobile platforms to drive organic growth and reach new markets of nonsports customers.

Chairmans Statement
2017 was a year of significant achievement for Sportech PLC.
Following a positive litigation ruling and the sale of our core UK business the Group repaid 60 million of debt and returned 75 million to shareholders whilst having sufficient cash to facilitate immediate growth prospects during the year.
Your Board has also undergone some change during the year and Im delighted to have welcomed Richard Cooper and Giles Vardey who bring leading gaming and business experience and Andrew Gaughan now CEO to the PLC Board.
These appointments bring significant incremental expertise and skills to the
The Board wishes to acknowledge Directors who departed the Board in 2017 Roger Withers who had served as Chairman Ian Penrose Chief Executive and Mickey Kalifa CFO.
In March 2017 the Group announced a conditional agreement to sell the Football Pools business which was subsequently passed by shareholders in April 2017.
The Football Pools represented the mainstay of the Groups EBITDA and in particular the bulk of the UK earnings stream.
The sale completed in June 2017 and now the Groups earnings are around 80% denominated in USD with GBP representing around 10% Euros 8% and CAD 2%.
The Board anticipates further growth in USD contributions going forward and the Board will be evaluating whether the reporting currency for the Group should become the US dollar.
The current Board recognises stakeholder concern regarding previous investment venture returns and a track record of impairing investments which unfortunately continued in 2017 as the book valuations of various historic investments have yet again had to be revalued downwards.
Given an absence of an investment strategy in early 2017 to provide tangible growth opportunities the Board elected to return capital to shareholders thus de risking investor capital.
Indeed the Group made two significant returns of capital to shareholders during the year.
This was the first time in its recent history that capital has been returned to shareholders.
21 million was returned in March 2017 via a Tender Offer and following a required Court approved capital reduction a further 54 million was returned by way of a special dividend in December 2017.
Sportech Front end 27 April.
8 27042018 2030 9 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Following the sale of the Football Pools and significant capital returns to shareholders it became inevitable that having a UKbased executive management team was not an appropriate structure for the Group going forward.
Following the announced decisions by UKbased senior executives to leave the now USfocused Group a cost reduction exercise commenced to streamline the UK cost base. significantly going forward.
At all times during this process consent has been sought and been given by the regulatory authorities where change in management is a condition precedent.
The Group continues to enjoy excellent relationships with these regulators.
Formal Sale Process In October 2017 after a number of unsolicited external approaches the Board decided that it would consider formal offers for the Group and commenced a Formal Sale Process.
The Board and senior management invested considerable time over many months in diligently managing this initiative meeting numerous interested parties and presenting the business capabilities and potential.
However the Board together with its advisors concluded that none of those approaches were likely to result in an offer for all or a material part of the Group that the Board would be able to recommend to shareholders and the termination of this process was therefore announced on 14 March 2018.
Strategic Review The Strategic Review announced on 18 September 2017 concluded that Sportech has significant potential for longterm value creation through a combination of growing its core businesses diversification and benefitting from the possible liberalisation of sports betting in a number of US states.
Following the departure of the previous senior executives Richard Cooper a NonExecutive Director and Chair of the Audit Committee and I commenced a thorough review of the financial and contractual affairs of the Group.
The Group views exceptional items as simply that items that are exceptional in nature and size the de minimis being the materiality threshold applied by the auditors and which if to recur are not therefore exceptional or separately reported items which we understand to be the preferred usage of the FRC.
Sportech Front end 27 April.
9 27042018 2030 10 Sportech PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 A number of provisions have been made for onerous contracts or potential bad debts as this process unfolded.
Some of the significant project and investment cessations have been as follows In January 2010 the Group announced a joint venture JV launching a sports gaming business in India.
3.1 million was invested in that JV up to 31 December 2016 which by that date had all been expensed.
The JV was almost dormant in 2017 and by February 2018 the JV was terminated as minimal revenues were recognised and the JV had ongoing costs with limited potential for returns.
In December 2013 the Group announced plans to build a proposed 10000 sq. t.
Norco Southern California.
This site had not been developed currently lies vacant and during 2017 a further provision of 1.2 million was made for the onerous lease and other associated liabilities.
Alternative use options are currently being reviewed.
In October 2015 the Group opened its first branded sports bar Striders restaurant and betting facility in downtown San Diego California.
This operation was a joint venture with local operators.
The venue has not been as successful as the previous executive team had originally forecasted and the Group is in dispute with its partners and accordingly a provision of 1.3 million has been made for onerous contracts.
The Board are reviewing its options in relation to this investment.
Additionally the Group undertook a review of noncore assets and in the Netherlands following the award of a new fiveyear licence in June 2017 to provide the exclusive right to conduct tote betting on horseracing the Board decided to revisit the potential sale of that business.
I am pleased to report that in March 2018 we executed a sale and purchase agreement subject to certain regulatory conditions and anticipate completing on this disposal in H1 2018.
This business has been included in these accounts as an asset held for sale.
The Board are further examining the value of surplus realestate in North America to assess all options to extract further value for shareholders.
The Group owns two freehold sites in Connecticut a nineacre site in New Haven and a sevenacre site adjacent to the airport in Bradley.
However the Group does operate a significant venue onsite at each of these locations which therefore restricts its flexibility.

10 27042018 2030 11 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Regulatory framework and US Sports Betting The possibility of the US market moving towards a broader regulation of sports gaming continues at pace with a number of states preparing to enact legislation if the US Supreme Court permits.
Furthermore the governing bodies of certain significant US sports have lobbied hard for an openingup of legislation.
Through the Groups existing regulatory commercial and customer network the Board believe there are significant opportunities to leverage these relationships and as a result of this significant time has been invested in assessing the optimal platform for Sportechs B2C and B2B businesses to capitalise on this potential momentous change.
The Board anticipates announcing the launch of a Sportsbook utilising a reputable thirdparty vendor in H12018.
Shoreline Star LLC Agreement As part of the acquisition of the US racing business from Scientific Games in 2010 the Group acquired a contract with Shoreline Star LLC Shoreline.
This contract provides a share of profits to Shoreline from new forms of gaming within the US state of Connecticut for 25 years after the commencement of legalised new forms of gaming.
The dominant clause of this contact reads Under the terms of the amended contract Shoreline Star shall now receive approximately 50% of profits after tax from these new forms of gaming for a 25 year period with a ratchet downwards commencing after five years following commencement.
Any payments under this revised contract will only occur after Sportech fully recover any capital investment from additional cash flows generated.
The downward ratchet provides for a reduction in profit share paid to Shoreline Star LLC from 50% to end year five then 40% to end year ten and 30% for remaining fifteen years.
I raise this now purely to ensure shareholders are fully aware of this material contract when assessing the potential net returns to Sportech PLC from the advent of US Sports Betting or other forms of enhanced gaming that benefit the Group within the State of

11 27042018 2030 12 Sportech PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Outlook and Trading Update
Q12018 revenue growth in Venues has been higher than in Q12017 but below our expectations.
The Stamford location continues to build market positioning and financial momentum but the pre opening business plan was overly optimistic and the actual and now anticipated timeline for the business to reach revenues and profits commensurate with targeted initial investment returns will take well into 2019.
However in order to address certain opportunities we are at an advanced stage of recruiting experienced FandB and Group Sales expertise to build that side of the business aggressively going forward and to bring it in line with revenues and profit levels that this high quality and welllocated sports and wagering barrestaurant should be producing.
The output and results of these actions is unlikely to have a material impact until Q3Q4 of 2018 due to the management recruiting and rebuilding of local awareness for the facility.
Wagering revenues softness in the Venues business is primarily from our digital platform and at Stamford.
This is being addressed through a renewed digital focused marketing plan that is concentrated on combating outofstate digital Advanced Deposit Wagering ADW operators that have recruited and taken our Connecticut resident customers into their own ADW digital platforms all based in Oregon.
This business and revenue recapture and digital development will be further augmented and supported through the anticipated gaming bill SB 276 coming into force and effect late this spring for which the Group has led the lobby with our Connecticut General Assembly and Department of Consumer Protection regulatory offices.
The gaming
Chairmans Statement continued
Sportech Front end 27 April.
12 27042018 2030 13 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements bill in essence seeks to explicitly make illegal the taking of wagers from Connecticut residents within Connecticut unless being taken by the authorised parimutuel wagering operator which of course is Sportech Venues.
The Group will be aggressively enlisting the cease and desist actions of the Connecticut Attorney Generals office in upholding this law when it comes into force.
The Group will combine an aggressive marketing advertising and customer rebate programme that messages and focuses around taking back customers from the businesses operating illegally from outside the State of Connecticut.
Racing and Digital The component revenue parts of the Racing and Digital businesses including onetime sales core contracted and recurring tote services across all regions digital B2B services and Bump 5050 are broadly trading in line with our expectations.
Costs across all the businesses are broadly in line with managements expectations and our sales pipeline remains a key focus for the year.
It will now be the key variant in achieving or exceeding our internal revenue and profits expectations for 2018.
Cash position Net of customer balances the Groups cash position at 31 March was 12 million.
The initial net proceeds of the sale of the Venues business in the Netherlands are expected to be 2.6 million receivable in JuneJuly 2018.
This is both an exciting and challenging time for the Group as it continues to navigate through certain historic issues and present a transparent and realistic overview of the Company.
The Board and core management led by Andrew Gaughan the new CEO remain focused on executing a strategy to capitalise on the significant potential a US Supreme Court repeal of the Professional and Amateur Sports Act PASPA could deliver.
The senior management team remain resolute in its proactive campaign with the Connecticut General Assembly and associated stakeholders in positioning Sportech as the obvious licensee to conduct sports betting within that state.
The Group is well advanced in securing a Sportsbook partner in anticipation of regulatory easing and the Board assures shareholders that the core management team continues to provide testimony evidence and insight to the political debate on this critical topic.
In addition the senior management team have commenced discussions with their business clients and others across the US in preparing them for the opportunities and challenges ahead.

The Group emerged from this period leaner and more invigorated executing strategies that include the continued expansion of our international footprint in Racing and Digital and the ongoing development of the Bump 5050 product focused on the charitable foundations of tierone professional sports teams.
We are also pursuing further deployment of online and mobile platforms to drive growth and reduce operational costs and diversification into new forms of gaming including sports wagering as and when regulations permit both in the Venues business and in the US Racing and Digital business.

14 27042018 2030 15 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Despite missing our 2017 international sales targets the Racing and Digital divisions core recurring tote technology service and Bump 5050 revenues have progressed well providing a clear indication of longer term sustained earnings growth and value creation emanating from the technology and business investments already made.
The sales anticipated in 2017 that did not come to fruition have not yet been closed and continue to be considered realistic opportunities.
Some of these have been rolled into our 2018 pipeline including multiple projects in Asia and Europe such as our recently announced Quantum System upgrade sale to Royal Sabah Turf Club of Malaysia.
After four years of strong sales revenues with annual average sales exceeding USD6.5million and contribution margins of 45% 2017 is considered an unusually low sales year.
However continued strong growth in recurring commingling service revenues helped offset this onetime relatively soft year in sales.
Developments
In 2017 key technology advances in the core Quantum System software were realised and the global commingling business grew significantly through highvalue connections between the UK Asia Europe and North America facilitated by the global network of Quantum Data and Operations
These are Sportechs proprietary products and centres.
The capacity of the Quantum Systemsupported global pools and bet types was significantly expanded to include exotic complex parlays of particular interest to customers in Asia and the popular French pools offered by ZEturf and PMU.
The North American footprint was strengthened executing 13 longterm contract extensions with existing customers and we further expanded the global footprint to include four new customers including Dansk Hestevddelb ApS the joint operating company for horseracing and operator of all nine racetracks in Denmark.
This is in addition to the longstanding contract we have with Danske Spil AS the national lottery in Denmark.
Racing and Digital also continued to enhance and promote its digital technologies rollingout key updates to the G4 whitelabel betting website product and deploying the Digital Link mobile app along with the selfservice BetJet SL 2.5 betting terminals at Ascot racecourse in the UK under our contract with Betfred.
Looking forward I see additional opportunities in both the North American and international markets some of which have already come to fruition.
Since the start of the year important new contracts and contract extensions have been signed in the tote services global commingling and digital services businesses.
Additional commingling agreements have already been completed with new customers in Europe Norsk Rikstoto the foundation that supervises pari mutuel betting on horseracing in Norway and OPAP the holder of exclusive rights to numerical lotteries and sports betting in Greece.
These commingling contracts leverage the Quantum System software and European hosting and operations services to further expand the global commingling footprint and the menu of hosted pools and bet types.
A new tenyear USD10 million agreement with Camarero Racetrack has been signed covering both Tote and Digital Services and including the provision of a new G4 wagering website and Digital Link app to the exclusive operator of horseracing in Puerto Rico.
Longterm Tote customer Parx Racing once again selected Sportech for Tote services under a contract extension and also became a new Digital Services customer beginning in 2018 under a new fiveyear USD4.1 million contract using the G4 website and Digital Link mobile products.
Parx Racing has a wellestablished intrastate account betting operation in Pennsylvania and this contract is a significant endorsement of Sportechs digital technology platforms.
In North America I am reexamining our Digital Services business with a focus on improving profitability and cash generation.
We intend to push our digital technologies into racetrack and OTB operations in order to reduce capital and operational costs through the encouragement of bring your own device mobile apps and websites.
New products will be added to the Quantum System software including additional lottery products currently offered by LEIDSA a Sportech customer in the Dominican Republic which would be suitable for deployment by other small private lottery operators particularly in Latin America and Asia.

These additions helped bring the total number of Bump 5050 customers to 68 representing foundations from 16 different professional and collegiate sports leagues.
In 2017 Bump 5050 helped their customer foundations raise just under US11 million.
This year Bump 5050 launched a new online and mobile raffle program to supplement instadia play and used this new platform to help the Tampa Bay Lightning Foundation reach a jackpot record of US270000 during the NHL AllStar event.

Bobby Vs Stamford featuring 200 high definition TVs multi functional party spaces an indoor golf simulator and a designated betting area with VIP spaces and state oftheart betting and viewing carrels in the heart of Stamfords downtown district.
Performance to date has been below the original expectations set by previous management and we are reviewing growth initiatives for this venue on both the wagering and food and beverage sides including a comprehensive and aggressive plan for Group sales and food and beverage management and more proactive deployment of mobile betting with Sportechs Digital Link.
The local management team successfully lobbied the Connecticut legislature for permission to open an additional six venues over and above the 18 we were already permitted to open which will allow expansion and to eventually diversify into sports betting should the laws and regulations be adjusted to permit it.
There remains illegal competition from unlicensed internet betting operators who accept wagers from Connecticut residents despite being issued cease and desist letters by the States Attorney Generals office.
In 2017 and into 2018 we are pursuing new remedies available to us including increased legal protections for Connecticuts only licensed and taxed operator.
Despite thissite achieved an 11% increase in 2017 from online and mobile handle versus prior year.
Regardless of the outcome of any remedial actions at the state level the Board is taking a much more aggressive and proactive stance with regard to promotion and marketing of its digital channels.
Sportech holds a distinct advantage in terms of both technology and access to bricks and mortar crossselling and these advantages will be fully exploited to drive customer acquisition and to increase betting by customers who may hold multiple accounts.
The Venues division capitalises on its operational expertise to offer turnkey managed venue packages to licensed operators.
In 2017 Venues extended key managed venue contracts with the Mohegan Sun Casino in Connecticut along with two other racebooks in Louisiana and the Caribbean.
Corporate Management Structuring and Focus With a shift in the senior management presence from the UK to North America management operations from the Groups existing London base will be relocating to the existing operations centres in Toronto and the US where both I and a new CFO will be located.
This shift will not only allow reduced corporate overhead costs but will also place senior corporate management in closer proximity to global technology and operational focal points and the consumerfacing business while maintaining key bases of operation and secondary business offices at existing locations in Bristol UK Ireland and
Further financial focus will characterise senior management of Sportech going forward with a renewed and vigorous focus on billing debt collection and working capital improvements within the business and a stricter financial evaluation of new business opportunities capital investments and partnerships.
2017 was a year of material change for Sportech and 2018 is shaping up to be one of significant opportunity.
Global recurring service revenues in our B2B businesses provide a clear indication of growth resulting from several years of technology and operational investment.
New contracts and sales opportunities in the 2018 pipeline speak to the efficacy of our technology and business strategy.
The
Bump 5050 growth trajectory of the past four years is on pace to continue with new sales platforms and opportunities in new markets.
The Venues business now has room for meaningful strategic expansion and the tools to more aggressively compete in Connecticuts digital marketplace.
Finally both our Venues and our Racing and Digital divisions are well positioned to act quickly and decisively on sports wagering if and when the regulations allow it.
I am pleased to be leading Sportech and enthusiastic about what the future holds for its shareholders customers and employees.
Indeed at this juncture I would like to thank all staff across the Group for their hard work and commitment.

These items are discussed in further detail below.
Adjusted operating expenses gross of capitalised software rose by 2949k at constant currency 7.6% of which an additional 739k arose from the recognition of bad debts and the bulk of the remaining increase arising from staff 1026k and property 663k.

Other staff cost increases chiefly arose in venues where extra staff were taken on for the running of the expanded Bobby Vs sports bar in Stamford Connecticut.
Significant savings were made in the corporate function with a downsizing of both staff and office premises.

Those shares were originally acquired as part of the Groups disposal of SportechNYX Gaming LLC in 2015 at which point the share price was CAD 4.06.
Those shares have been subsequently revalued as available for sale financial assets and losses realised when shares are disposed of.
This resulted in a loss of 1603k which we have disclosed as a separate item.
A marktomarket loss of 746k was recognised in 2016 and shown within exceptional items.
Owing to the magnitude of the loss and the fact that the asset has been disposed of we believe it is more instructive for the readers to show the loss this year and the marktomarket revaluation last year as a separate reported item.

This was accompanied by a strategic review and Formal Sales Process under the Takeover Code following a series of initial approaches made to the Company.
The costs of honouring the contracts of those departing executives along with some other staff in senior positions represents the majority of the costs of restructuring and redundancy.
680k of these costs were paid after the year end.
Note b The Group had a number of contractual arrangements in the State of California none of which was profitable and included realestate leases for a considerable duration with no benefit to the Group.
These have been provided for in full with certain other items also written off.
Note c Transaction costs relate to those incurred in the Groups Football Pools disposal.
This disposal was completed in H117 with additional disposal costs incurred during the year of 3248k.
Those 2017 costs have been presented as part of the loss on disposal of Football Pools as shown in note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Note d Given the political nature of lobbying the costs of presenting the case for liberalising sports betting and gambling in Connecticut along with costs incurred in obtaining a licence in New Jersey have been disclosed separately.
Note e A new incentive plan was introduced in the year the Value Creation Plan VCP as approved by shareholders on 24 May 2017.
The substantial cost of designing this scheme and implementing it is disclosed as a separate item.

Further receipts net of costs were recognised during the year representing primarily recovery of legal and advisory costs awarded by the Court to the defendants.
Note 8  Share based payments 000s 2017 Reported Accelerated charge for departing executives and directors 3765 Normalised charges 666 87 4431 87 Under IFRS charges arise from events at the date of grant whether the options ultimately lapse or not.
There was a charge accelerated by the departure of the former CEO and CFO along with one other nonBoard executive.
The modelling of the overall cost of the VCP was done by a bigfour accounting firm other than the auditors.
The option plan adopted by shareholders earlier in 2017 the VCP was essentially a 20% capital growth pool over a 8% compound hurdle to the exdiv share price.
The starting point was a cumdiv price of 97.8 pence.
Black Scholes modelling was used.
The departing executives had between them 52% of that 7 million pool.
Together with other outstanding PSP awards an accelerated charge of 3765k has been recognised in 2017.
It is noncash in nature.
Note 9  Depreciation and amortisation Tangible and intangible fixed assets are depreciatedamortised over their useful lives as disclosed in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Both charges have reduced from prior year primarily due to impairment charges made to certain assets in 2016.
However in 2017 the Group incurred further costs of 5238k in the construction and fitout of the new Stamford Venue 2016 2451k and the depreciation of these tangible fixed assets amounted to 200k during the year.
Note 10  Amortisation of acquired intangibles Intangible assets acquired on the acquisitions of eBet Datatote and Bump relate primarily to customer relationships the most material of which reached the end of its useful life in 2016.
All those acquired intangible assets are fully amortised as at December 2017.
Note 11  Asset impairments 000s 2017 Reported Impairment of PPE 874 5089 Impairment of goodwill  1843 Impairment of intangible assets 12040 14220 Site preparation and construction costs in the town of Norco California were incurred by the Group in previous years when a new venue build was anticipated.
The Group is evaluating its involvement in California and accordingly the capitalised costs 874k in respect of those sites have been impaired.
Sportech Annual Report Pt4 Sportech Annual Report Pt4 Page 25 In 2016 goodwill relating to the eBet business within Racing and Digital was fully impaired.
There is no goodwill held on the balance sheet at December 2017 given that the disposal of the Football Pools during the year see note 16 eliminated the goodwill held for that asset.
The Group is obligated to conduct an impairment review of its business units each year based on events that existed on the balance sheet date and not on events regarding legislation or liberalisation which might occur after the balance sheet date.
Accordingly the softer level of betting transactions in the Venues business has led to a downgrading of its accounting value and an impairment charge has been taken of 12040k.
Impairments
1093k against Venues assets.
Note 12  Loss on disposal of investments As disclosed in note 6 the Group has recognised a loss of 1603k in respect of a disposal of its investments in NYX Gaming Group Limited 2016 746k.
Note 13  Joint ventures Following the decision to exit from its business interests in California the Board considers there to be insufficient certainty around the recoverable value of the Groups investment in its joint venture sports bar Striders in San Diego and a provision has been made against the entire investment 1.2 million.

Note 15  Taxation The Group has recognised a net tax credit of 230k due primarily to losses made in the US which can be carriedforward for up to 20 years and relieved against future profits.
The gross losses provided for as a deferred tax asset at 31 December 2017 were 19.5 million 2016 11.8 million.
It is anticipated that the Group will recover those tax losses within ten years.
The approximate tax base cost of the individual divisions and therefore the one on which any capital gain would be assessed in the case of a partial breakup of the Group is shown below Racing and Digital 10 million approximately 7.1 million Venues 20 million approximately 14.3 million US rates of capital gains tax range from 25% to 35%.

The Group continue to believe that the maximum contingent amount will be due.
This is discounted and accrues over the relevant period to May 2020.

The Group has a significant number of terminals that are deployed on customer sites many of which are older models.
There is a requirement therefore for the Group to hold a proportional amount of spare parts for the terminals that are being used by customers.
A review of inventory led the Board to conclude that given certain spare parts had not been utilised for a considerable period of time 126k should be recognised as obsolete and provided against increasing the total inventory provision to 310k.

Financial Review continued
Sportech Annual Report Pt4 Sportech Annual Report Pt4 Page 30 Note 24  Defined benefit pension liabilities The Group retains the legacy obligation for the Football Pools pension scheme in which all 63 members are retired.
There is in an IAS19R surplus of 9k at December 2017 for this scheme.
The Group is actively trying to secure a buyout for the scheme not least as the actuarial and trustee fees each year of running this scheme amount to around 80k.
Payments into the scheme during the year totalled 305k 2016 112k with a oneoff increase in the payments being made to fully fund the schemes liabilities.
In addition the Groups US employees are enrolled in pension schemes which have a deficit of 1546k.
The US legal obligation is to fund these schemes no less than 85% of the liability.
The payments made to the US schemes in the year was 223k 2016 205k.
US law requires that any actuarial deficit as measured in any one year is funded to not less than 85% in the subsequent financial year.
Thus there will be an accelerated cash funding of these schemes required in 2018 of around 0.6 million.

A further amount of 487k has been received by the Group in H118 relating to the costs awarded.
This amount is shown within other receivables on the balance sheet.
Note 26  Taxation liabilities and items subject to challenge Following the successful Spot the Ball VAT reclaim the Group is aware that HMRC are closely examining all the Groups tax affairs.
The Board after taking professional advice believe that the liabilities recorded in these financial statements are correct and whilst they are open to challenge the Groups position will be defended robustly.
In order to progress an appeal the Group is making one against HMRC for VAT on head office costs going back a number of years.
The Group has made an in escrow payment to HMRC of 1.3 million in Q12018.
The Board having taken professional advice on this matter believe this is fully recoverable.
Sportech Annual Report Pt4 Sportech Annual Report Pt4 Page 32 Note 27  Contingent liabilities and litigation The Group is engaged in certain disputes in the ordinary course of business which could potentially lead to outflows greater than those provided for on the balance sheet.
The maximum possible exposure considered to exist in view of advice received from the Groups professional advisors is up to 0.5 million.
Management are of the view that the risk of those outflows arising is not probable and accordingly they have been disclosed as contingent items rather than recognised as liabilities in the financial statements.

Corporate Governance Sportech Annual Report Pt5 Sportech Annual Report Pt5 Page 34 35 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Measuring risk The Groups risk management strategy is to consider risks arising from each area of the business through a topdown and bottomup approach.
This is achieved by the communication through the Group of a risk appetite statement.
The Board established and approved a risk appetite statement in 2015 which has been distributed to the management teams of the operating segments.
This statement which has been reviewed by the Board during the year provides guidance on the Groups appetite for risk across business areas and supports the management teams in determining the appropriate balance of risk and return within their businesses.
The management teams of each business units assess risk and formally update their businessspecific risk registers.
Risks are measured in relation to their mitigated likelihood and their prospective impact were they to arise in accordance with the following risks matrix The Board formally reviews a Group principal risk register annually.
Principal risks to the Group are considered to be those risks identified by the operating segments as having an overall rating of eight or higher or an impact of four despite the low level of mitigated likelihood.
The table below shows the Boards assessment of the most significant risks to Sportech PLC as a group the potential impact of such risks and the mitigating activities that the Group carries out to reduce the likelihood and impact of such risks.

Sportech Annual Report Pt5 Sportech Annual Report Pt5 Page 36 37 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements The Board has assessed the prospects of the Group over a longer period than the 12 months required by the going concern requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code the Code.
This longerterm assessment process supports the Boards statements on both viability as set out below and going concern made on page 71.
The Board conducted this review for a period up to December 2020 which was selected for the following reasons i.
The Groups strategic review process generally covers a threeyear period. ii.
The Groups operations are underpinned by largely stable businesses and mediumterm contracts allowing for sufficient certainty to forecast results for this length of time.
The most recent strategic review completed 13 March 2018 considered the Groups cash flows earnings leverage and other key financial ratios over the period.
These metrics were subject to sensitivity analysis which involved flexing a number of the main assumptions underlying the forecast both individually and in unison.
The assumptions included the impact of the potential occurrence of the Groups principal risks and the effectiveness of available mitigating actions other than the impact of a loss of a key licence or severe technology failure.
These were not included within the forecasts as it is the Boards opinion that the likelihood of those risks occurring is minimal.
Based on the results of this analysis the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment.
Viability Statement Sportech Annual Report Pt5 Sportech Annual Report Pt5 Page 37 The Group endeavours to act responsibly for all its stakeholders including not only its shareholders employees and its customers but the wider public and the environment.
The Groups divisions hold licences to permit the provision of businesstobusiness services for pari mutuel betting on horse and greyhound racing in over 30 jurisdictions in the Americas and Europe.
Licences for businesstoconsumer activity for the same products are held in Connecticut California and The Netherlands and for a wider range of gambling products in the UK.
The Group General Counsel and local legal counsel ensure the Group meets its policy of maintaining the highest standards of compliance and integrity.
The
Group also employs security and compliance staff whose primary role is to ensure that our customers are treated fairly that our advertising is compliant with advertising standards and codes that the young and vulnerable are prevented from accessing our products and that abuse and illegal behaviour are identified and stopped.
All gaming products are subject to age restrictions and age verification software is used by the Group where appropriate.
Whilst the Company and a number of its subsidiaries are incorporated in the UK the bulk of the operations are based in North America where standards and regulation are different to the EU.
The Group therefore has to balance all its obligations under all the jurisdictions it operates in which imposes strains on its cost base which we aim to mitigate through efficiencies wherever possible.
Environment
The Group recognises its responsibility to achieve good environmental practice and continues to strive to improve its environmental impact.
The nature of its business results in the principal environmental impact arising from energy and paper consumption.
Wherever possible waste consumable materials are recycled or disposed of in a manner most suitable to reduce any impact on the natural environment.
The
Groups business practices encourage the use of technology to facilitate information data collection and dissemination which has led to reduced demand for paper resources.
All employees are encouraged to participate in the implementation of this policy and suppliers of consumable products are encouraged to be environmentally friendly wherever practical.
The Company has an obligation under the UK Companies Act 2006 to report on greenhouse gas emissions.
In 2017 an increase in intensity of 13% is seen as the new Stamford venue has opened and remains in its trading infancy.
As the popularity of the venue grows and the Groups oneoff sales move back towards normalised levels this intensity will reduce.
The Group remains focused on supporting good causes in the communities where our customers live and our businesses operate and identifying further opportunities to continue this support.
Through its Bump 5050 subsidiary the Group has raised just under 11m for sports foundations in the US and Canada in 2017 including those associated with Dallas Cowboys Atlanta Braves and Vegas Golden Knights.
Employees
The Board is acutely aware of the vital contribution of employees to the future success of the business.
It recognises the importance of providing employees with information on matters of concern to them enabling employees to improve their performance and make an active contribution to the achievement of the Groups business objectives.
This is accomplished through formal and informal briefings and meetings.

The Company did not have a Senior Independent Director throughout the period.
Notwithstanding the above the Board is comfortable that it has achieved and continues to achieve good governance as a result of the experience of the Chairman and the appointment of Richard Cooper as a new Independent Nonexecutive Director on 24 May 2017 and the additional appointment of Giles Vardey as an Independent Director on 17 November 2017.
The Company confirms that Richard Cooper former CFO of FTSE250 company GVC Holdings PLC has the recent relevant financial expertise required to effectively challenge and review accounting judgements and reporting.
With this and the extensive corporate experience of Richard McGuire and Giles Vardey in mind the Company is comfortable that the Committees have continued to function to a high standard throughout and robustly challenge management and the preparation of the financial statements.
The search for a further new Independent Non executive Director is being undertaken and the Board has been mindful of its responsibility to appoint an individual who achieves the appropriate balance of skills experience independence and knowledge of the Company to enable them to discharge their respective duties and responsibilities effectively.
Further to this the Board anticipates announcing the appointment of a further Independent Nonexecutive Director to the Board imminently.
The Chairman is no longer a member of the Audit or Remuneration Committees although chairs the Nominations Committee.
As announced on Tuesday 24 April 2018 the Company has identified a suitable CFO candidate and is conducting final appraisals before announcing their appointment in due course.
Conflicts of Interest The Board has a procedure in place to deal with a situation where a Director has a conflict of interest as required by the Companies Act 2006.
As part of this process the members of the Board prepare a list of other positions held and all other conflict situations that may need authorising either in relation to the Director concerned or his or her connected persons.
The Board considers each Directors situation and decides whether to approve any conflict situations taking into consideration what is in the best interests of the Company and whether the Directors ability to act in accordance with his or her wider duties is affected.
Each Director is required to notify the Company Secretary of any potential or actual conflict situations that will need to be authorised by the
Authorisations given by the Board are reviewed annually.

Audit Committee The Audit Committee currently comprises two independent Nonexecutives Richard Cooper as the Chairman and Giles Vardey.
During the period before the appointment of Giles Vardey Richard McGuire also was a member of the Committee.
The Committee is scheduled to meet at least three times a year.
The Committees main responsibilities include reviewing the Annual Report and Accounts and Interim Report including considering significant financial reporting issues and judgements that they contain.
The
Committee reviews and challenges where necessary the consistency and changes to accounting policies methods used to account for significant and unusual transactions whether the Company has followed appropriate accounting standards and the clarity of disclosure in the Companys financial statements.
Further to this the Committee has delegated from the Board the responsibility for review of the effectiveness of internal controls the Companys whistleblowing procedures and the need for an internal audit function as well as the scope extent and effectiveness of such a function.
The Group acknowledges that DTR 7.1.1A had been breached following the revision to the Rule for the period beginning 1 January 2017 in relation to the majority of members of the Audit Committee being independent.
Following the appointment of Giles Vardey that breach was rectified.
Members of the senior finance team are invited to attend the Committee as appropriate.
Financial reporting The primary role of the Committee in relation to financial reporting is the review with both management and the external Auditor of the appropriateness of the halfyear and annual financial statements concentrating on amongst other matters consistency of the Annual Report as a whole and ensuring it presents a fair balanced and understandable picture of the Company as well as providing shareholders with the information necessary to assess the Companys performance business model and strategy the quality and acceptability of accounting policies and practices the clarity of the disclosures and compliance with financial reporting standards and relevant financial and governance reporting requirements material areas in which significant judgements have been applied or there has been discussion with the external Auditors and any correspondence from regulators in relation to financial reporting.
The Committee considered internal reports from the senior finance staff together with the external Auditors report in their halfyear review and annual audit in reviewing the Groups financial reporting function.
The primary areas of judgement considered by the Committee in relation to the 2017 financial statements were the assumptions underlying impairment testing of the Groups intangible assets the exposure to tax liabilities and the carrying value of contingent consideration receivable from NYX In order to be comfortable with the consistency fairness and accuracy of these financial statements the following was undertaken in relation to these key areas of judgement detailed review and discussion of models used for impairment testing and scenario analysis In testing assets for impairment the key assumptions underpinning their valueinuse are discount rates and growth rates applied to projected earnings.
These assumptions are inherently judgemental.
The
Committee considers those judgements in light of regular updates received on business plans and performance against targets and has challenged management as to their rational for recognising impairments in the current year.
In addition the Committee considers findings of the work of the Auditors in this area.
In reviewing the exposure to potential tax liabilities the Audit Committee review the key assumptions and liaise with its external advisors to understand the range of possible outcomes given change in particular judgements.
Correspondence from tax Sportech PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Corporate Governance Report continued Sportech Annual Report Pt5 Sportech Annual Report Pt5 Page 42 43 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements authorities if any is also reviewed.
The reasonableness of managements judgement is also considered in the light of the work of the Auditors.
In assessing the carrying value of the contingent consideration receivable from NYX the Committee receives updates from executive management on the development of the North American online gaming market and the pertinent regulatory and commercial issues.
External audit The Committee is responsible for the relationship with the external Auditors.
The Committee considers the nature and extent of nonaudit services provided by the Auditors in order to seek to balance the maintenance of objectivity access to applicable technical expertise and value for money.
To help avoid the objectivity and independence of the external Auditors becoming compromised the Committee has a formal policy governing the engagement of the external Auditor to provide nonaudit services.
This policy precludes PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP from providing certain services such as internal audit work or accounting services and as of 1 January 2017 tax advice and any advisory service which ultimately has an impact material in size on the treatment of items in the financial statements.
The Group complies with the new ethical standards which also require that fees for nonaudit services do not exceed 70% of the average of the audit fee for the prior three years prospectively from 1 January 2017.
For all other services the Board must approve spend on discrete projects in excess of 10k.
The Committee is regularly updated on the spend to date with the external Auditors and also with other financial advisers.
The Auditors are also subject to professional standards that safeguard the integrity of their auditing role.
The Committee remains confident that the objectivity and independence of the external Auditors are not in any way impaired by reason of the audit and nonaudit services which they provide to the Group.
Moreover the Committee is satisfied that such work is best handled by them either because of their knowledge of the Group or because they have been awarded it through a competitive tendering process.
In addition the independence of the Auditors is safeguarded by the use of separate teams for individual assignments such as acquisition due diligence and the audit being subject to internal PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP quality control procedures.
A breakdown of nonaudit fees charged by the Auditors is disclosed in note 7 in the Notes to the financial statements.
A significant proportion of the nonaudit fees charged by the Auditors in 2017 relates to work undertaken in respect of corporate activity.
It was concluded by the Committee that it was in the interest of the Company to purchase these services on a single tender basis from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP due to the cumulative historical knowledge already gained the timing of the work the tiein to the financial statements and confidentiality.
Effectiveness
The effectiveness of the external audit process is dependent on appropriate audit risk identification and at the start of the audit cycle the Company receives from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP a detailed audit plan Audit Strategy Memorandum identifying their assessment of these key risks.
For 2017 the significant and elevated risks identified were in relation to impairment of intangible assets uncertain tax positions carrying value of contingent consideration in relation to NYX.
The Committee has time with the external Auditors without management present at each meeting to provide additional opportunity for open dialogue and feedback.
Matters typically discussed include the Auditors assessment of business risks and management activity thereon the transparency and openness of interactions with management confirmation that there has been no restriction in scope placed on them by management independence of their audit and how they have exercised professional scepticism.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee also has regular discussions with the external audit partner outside the formal Committee process.
Appointment and reappointment The Committee considers the reappointment of the external Auditors including the rotation of the audit partner each year and also assesses their independence on an ongoing basis.
The external Auditors are required to rotate the audit partner responsible for the Group audit every five years.
The current lead audit partner Nigel Reynolds has performed the role since 2014.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have been the Companys external Auditors for more than 20 years Sportech Annual Report Pt5 Sportech Annual Report Pt5 Page 43 although a competitive tender process was conducted in 2006.
As part of the Committees review of the objectivity and effectiveness of the audit process an assessment was made not to put the audit engagement out to tender in 2017.
The Committee will continue to assess the appropriate time at which an audit tender process should be conducted and continues to assess the effectiveness independence and value for money of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.
Transitional arrangements in the new ethical standards allow for the Auditor to remain in place for no longer than six years from 16 June 2014 and as such PricewaterhouseCoopers will be allowed to remain as the Groups Auditor until post signing of the 31 December 2019 financial statements at which point the Group will be required to rotate its Auditor.
The Audit Committee provided the Board with its recommendation to the shareholders on the reappointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as external Auditors for the year ending 31 December 2017 and as a result in accordance with Section 489 of the Companies Act 2006 a resolution proposing the reappointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our Auditors will be put to shareholders at the impending AGM.
There are no contractual obligations restricting the Committees choice of external Auditors and we do not indemnify our external
The Committee will keep the appointment of the external Auditors under annual review.
Internal control and internal audit The Board is responsible for the Groups system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness.
This responsibility has been delegated to the Audit
On this basis there is an ongoing process for identifying evaluating and managing significant risks faced by the Group.
Such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Controls are monitored by management review.
Data consolidated into the Groups financial statements is reconciled to the underlying financial systems.
A review of the consolidated data is undertaken by management to ensure that the true position and results of the Group are reflected through compliance with approved accounting policies and the appropriate accounting for nonroutine transactions.
The Group performs an annual strategy and budgeting process and the Board approves the annual Group budget as part of its normal responsibilities.
The Group results are reported monthly to the Board.
Regular reforecasts are undertaken and are produced for the Board whenever significant financial trends are identified in the periods between the quarterly assessments.
The Audit Committee reviews the effectiveness of the internal control environment of the Group excluding that of the Groups joint ventures.
It receives reports from the external Auditors which include recommendations for improvement.
The Audit Committees role in this area is confined to a high level review of the arrangements for internal control.
Significant risk issues are referred to the Board for consideration.
The principal risks facing the Group and the mitigating actions taken by the Board and management are included on pages 35 and 36 of the Strategic report.
To manage lowerlevel risks a risk management programme is in place supported by a business control and risk selfassessment process and a business continuity plan.
The risk management programme places responsibility on managers to identify risks facing each business unit and for implementing procedures to mitigate these risks.
The risk appraisal process is regularly reviewed by the Board and accords with the UK Corporate Governance Guidance.
The Audit Committee and Board have reviewed the effectiveness of the internal controls of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2017 and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report and Accounts.
This review covered controls in areas of finance operations risk management and compliance.
The Group does not have an internal audit function.
The Audit Committee has considered the use of an internal audit function during the year but considers that due to the size and nature of the Group there is not a requirement for such an internal function.
The central Group Finance function continues to undertake certain work of an internal audit nature and reports its findings to the Audit Committee.
The
Committee will continue to assess the need for specific internal audit reviews and an ongoing internal audit strategy during the coming months.
Whistleblowing policy The Company is committed to providing a safe and confidential avenue for all employees within the Group to raise concerns about serious wrongdoings.
The Company also acknowledges the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code in this regard Sportech PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Corporate Governance Report continued Sportech Annual Report Pt5 Sportech Annual Report Pt5 Page 44 45 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements which states that the Audit Committee should review arrangements by which staff of the Group may in confidence raise concerns about possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other matters.
Further to this an appropriate policy so as to encourage and enable staff to raise any such concerns is in place and has been throughout the year.
No instances of serious wrongdoing have been reported to the Audit Committee during the period.
Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee of the Board currently comprises the Nonexecutive Directors.
It is Chaired by Giles Vardey.
The purpose of the Committee is to ensure that the remuneration of Executive Directors and senior Executives together with their terms and conditions of employment is sufficient to recruit and retain individuals of the calibre required to ensure profitable growth of the business.
The Remuneration report is set out on pages 47 to 69.
Nominations Committee The Nomination Committee currently comprises the Nonexecutive Directors and is Chaired by Richard McGuire the Chairman of the Company.
Objectives
The Committees main objectives are to lead the process for any new appointments to the Board whether Executive or Nonexecutive and make recommendations to the Board in relation to the same evaluate the balance of skills knowledge and experience on the Board consider any matters relating to the continuation in office of any Director at any time review Committee memberships and formulate plans for succession.
Activities
The Nomination Committees activities are underpinned by the principle that all appointments should be made on merit against objective criteria and with due regard to the benefits of diversity on the Board.
Accordingly the Committee prepares a description of the role and capabilities required for a particular appointment.
Notably during the year under review the Committee recommended to the
Independent Nonexecutive Director and Chairman of the Audit Committee the appointment of Giles Vardey as an Independent Nonexecutive Director and Chairman of the Remuneration Committee the appointment of Andrew Gaughan as CEO with effect from 14 March 2018 The Committee in its recommendations to the Board acknowledges that diversity extends beyond the boardroom and supports management in their efforts to build a diverse organisation throughout the Group.
Out of a workforce of approximately 560 employees 32% are female and out of 21 members of senior management 33% are female.
The Committee endorses the Companys policy to attract and develop a highly qualified and diverse workforce to ensure that all selection decisions are based on merit and that all recruitment activities are fair and nondiscriminatory.
Although at present there are no female Board members the Committee acknowledges the importance of diversity including gender to the effective functioning of the Board.
Furthermore the Board acknowledges the recommendations of the Davies Report and supports the principle of improving in particular gender imbalance both at a Board level and throughout its businesses.
Subject to securing suitable candidates when recruiting additional Directors andor filling vacancies that arise when Directors do not seek re election we will seek to appoint new Directors who fit the skills criteria and gender balance that is in line with the Companys policy.
We continue to focus on encouraging diversity of business skills and experience recognising that Directors with diverse skill sets capabilities and experience gained from different geographic and cultural backgrounds enhance the Board.
Investors
There is regular dialogue with shareholders through a planned programme of investor relations which includes formal presentations of the Groups results by members of the Board.
Meetings also take place with institutional investors and analysts on a regular basis and there is regular communication with shareholders through the Annual and Interim Reports and Sportechs corporate website site.
They are also available at other times outside close periods to enter into dialogue with these shareholders.
All shareholders have the opportunity to question the Board at the AGM both formally and informally.
The Nonexecutive Directors have taken steps to develop an Sportech Annual Report Pt5 Sportech Annual Report Pt5 Page 45 understanding of the views of the major shareholders about the Company through facetoface contact and analyst and broker briefings.
All resolutions at the 2017 AGM held on 24 May 2017 were voted by way of a manual poll.
This follows best practice and allows the Company to count all votes rather than just those of shareholders attending the meeting.
As recommended by the Code all resolutions were voted separately and the voting results which included all votes cast for against and those withheld together with all proxies lodged prior to the meeting were indicated at the meeting and the final results were released to the London Stock Exchange as soon as practicable after the meeting.
The announcement was also made available on the Companys corporate website.
As in previous years the proxy form and the announcement of the voting results made it clear that a vote withheld is not a vote in law and will not be counted in the calculation of the proportion of the votes for or against the resolution.
The Board recognises the high level of withholding of votes and abstentions in relation to the Auditors remuneration resolution 6 and reappointment resolution 5 respectively at the 2017 AGM.
The appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as external Auditors is subject to regular review by the Audit Committee and it is the belief of the Committee as stated in the Audit Committee report that the effectiveness independence and value for money of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as external Auditors remains appropriate.
Sportech PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Corporate Governance Report continued Sportech Annual Report Pt5 Sportech Annual Report Pt5 Page 46 47 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Letter from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Dear Shareholder On behalf of the Board I am pleased to present for the first time as Sportechs Remuneration Committee chair the Directors Remuneration Report.
This report comprises an annual report on remuneration which describes how the shareholder approved Directors remuneration policy was implemented for the year ended 31 December 2017 and how we intend for the policy to apply for the year ending 31 December 2018.
This report together with this annual statement will be put to an advisory shareholder vote at the 2018 AGM.
Our approach to remuneration is governed by our directors remuneration policy which along with a new longterm incentive arrangement the Value Creation Plan VCP received binding shareholder approval at the General Meeting on 24 May 2017 and came into formal effect from that date.
The current intention is for the policy to operate over the three year period to 2020 and shareholders will not therefore be asked to approve any revisions at the 2018 AGM.
However to ensure clarity and transparency we have republished our directors remuneration policy report herewith pages 49 to 58.
Performance and remuneration for Our FY2017 performancerelated bonus was subject to adjusted Group EBITDA targets alongside a number of strategic objectives aligned with the KPIs of the business.
The threshold level of EBITDA was not met and no bonus was therefore payable for this element.
However as set out in detail in the Strategic report the Company delivered against a number of strategically important objectives during the year under review including for example concluding the sale of the Football Pools realising in the process around 80 million cash net of tax for the Group.
Executive Directors were thus achieved in full or in part and overall bonuses earned were 40% of maximum for Ian Penrose former Chief Executive Officer 43% of maximum for Mickey Kalifa former Chief Financial Officer and 4% of maximum for Andrew Gaughan formerly President of Sportech Racing and Digital and since March 2018 Group
With regards to our longerterm performance the FY2015 Performance Share Plan PSP awards which were granted on 9 March 2015 were subject to earnings per share 50% of the award and relative total shareholder return 50% of the award targets measured over a threeyear performance period.
Earnings per share failed to meet the stretching threshold target and so that part of the award lapsed.
However total shareholder return exceeded the upper quartile of the FTSE Small Cap Index excluding investment trusts over the performance period and therefore that part of the award vested in full.
As a result 50% of the award overall will vest.
Implementation of remuneration policy for 2018 The remuneration package for our executive directors will continue to be made up of base salary plus pension contributions and benefits and subject to stretching performance conditions an annual bonus paid in cash.
The current Executive Directors received oneoff awards under the VCP in 2017 and it is not currently intended that any further longterm incentive plan awards will be made to them as a result.
Within this framework we will be taking the following approach to the implementation of the remuneration policy for the year ending 31 December Salary  Andrew Gaughan was promoted to the position of Chief Executive Officer on 14 March 2018 from his previous position as President  Sportech Racing and Digital.
Andrews salary on appointment to the Board on 25 January 2017 in his position as President Sportech Racing and Digital was set at CAD400000 and his salary was increased from this level on his promotion to Chief Executive Officer by 25% to CAD500000.
Bonus  The maximum annual bonus will remain at 100% of salary for the Chief Executive Officer and 75% of salary for other executive directors.
The majority of the bonus will be based on financial performance measures and the minority on strategic objectives aligned with the KPIs of the business.
Longterm incentives  The VCP was introduced in 2017 to replace the PSP.
Awards under the VCP were first made in 2017 and it is intended that these awards will be oneoff in nature to cover the fiveyear vesting period of Report of the Remuneration Committee Sportech Annual Report Pt5 Sportech Annual Report Pt5 Page 47 Sportech PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Report of the Remuneration Committee continued the plan.
The Committee retains the right to make further awards from the shareholder approved pool and limits to personnel identified as key to delivering incremental value or executing a strategy to deliver tangible returns to shareholders.
The VCP is an uncapped arrangement and the Board is aware that potentially therefore the plan could pay out at significant levels however very significant value will only accrue to participants in the event of truly exceptional sustained long term performance.
Enhancing shareholder alignment  In addition to ensuring that the short and longterm performance measures and targets we set are closely linked to the achievement of the Companys key strategic and business objectives pay is subject to recovery and withholding provisions the VCP is measured over a fiveyear period and significant share ownership guidelines apply  all features intended to enhance the alignment of interest between executive directors and shareholders and to contribute to an appropriate level of risk mitigation.
The Board is satisfied that the policy continues to provide a good balance between potential rewards to executive directors on the one hand and on the other measures and targets which are appropriately stretching and that are aligned with the delivery of the overall longterm success of the Company.
Changes to the Board Chief Executive Officer Ian Penrose stepped down from the Board and left the employment of the Company on 31 December 2017 and Chief Financial Officer Mickey Kalifa also stepped down from the Board on 18 September 2017 and left the employment of the Company on 31 October 2017.
Details of their leaving arrangements can be found on the company website site Andrew Gaughan was promoted to Chief Executive Officer in March 2018 and his salary and incentive package on his promotion are set out above.
Richard McGuire was appointed temporarily to the position of Executive Chairman on 4 December 2017 from his previous position as Nonexecutive Chairman in relation to significant additional work undertaken following the announcement that Ian Penrose and Mickey Kalifa would be leaving Sportech and to lead the Strategic Review and Formal Sale Process.
Richard reverted to his Nonexecutive Chairman role on 14 March 2018.
His fixed remuneration arrangements on becoming Executive Chairman remained the same i. an annual fee of 120000.
On behalf of the Committee I thank shareholders for their support last year and hope you will be able to support the advisory vote on our directors remuneration report at the 2018 AGM.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has audited the contents of the Report to the extent required by the
Directors Remuneration Policy This part of the Directors Remuneration report sets out the key parts of the directors remuneration policy which was approved by shareholders in a binding vote at the General Meeting held on 24 May 2017.
The policy took formal effect from the date of approval and is currently intended to apply until the 2020 AGM.
A full version of the original shareholder approved policy can be found in the notice of General Meeting at http siteinvestorsshareholder informationmeetingsandvoting.
The primary objective of the remuneration policy is to promote the longterm success of the Company.
In working towards the fulfilment of this objective the Committee aims to i establish a competitive remuneration policy for the Executive Directors and ii align Senior Executives remuneration with the interests of shareholders and other stakeholders including customers and employees.
In connection with this the Committee aims to ensure that the remuneration packages offered to Executive Directors and Senior Executives are competitive and attract retain and motivate Executives of the right calibre reflect their responsibility and experience within the business incorporate a significant element of performancerelated pay linked to the achievement of challenging performance criteria that are aligned with the Groups strategy and with increasing shareholder value but remain appropriate given the Groups risk profile provide a total remuneration offering at target levels of performance that is competitive in the relevant market incentivise performance beyond target levels to be achieved by offering a significant proportion of remuneration to be delivered through incentive related pay create a strong alignment between the interests of senior management and the sustained delivery of shareholder value take due account of the principles set out in the Code take due account of pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group provide the foundation for overall reward and remuneration structures at senior management levels and provide an appropriate balance between non performancerelated and performancerelated pay.
The Committee reviews the remuneration policy and in particular performancerelated pay scheme structures on an annual basis to ensure that it continues to operate within the agreed risk framework of the Group.
The Committee ensures that an effective system of control and risk management is in place with regards to remuneration which includes access to the Audit Committee to discuss matters of operational and financial risk.
The Committee is satisfied that the policy does not encourage or reward for undue risk taking.
The Committee ensures that performancerelated pay structures will not raise environmental social or governance ESG risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
More generally regarding the overall remuneration structure there is no restriction on the Committee which prevents it from taking into account corporate governance on ESG matters.
Remuneration for Executive Directors The main component parts of the remuneration packages for Executive Directors are detailed in the table on pages 50 to 54 which should be read in conjunction with the recruitmentpromotion policy on page 57 and the Detailed remuneration policy for 2017 section of the Annual report on remuneration which starts on this page.

Sportech Annual Report Pt5 Sportech Annual Report Pt5 Page 54 55 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Choice of performance measures The choice of the performance metrics applicable to the annual bonus scheme reflects the Committees belief that any incentive compensation should be appropriately challenging and tied to both the delivery of targets relating to key financial measures that support the Companys strategic objectives and individual andor strategic performance measures intended to ensure that Executive Directors are incentivised to deliver across a range of objectives for which they are accountable.
The Committee has retained some flexibility on the specific measures which will be used to ensure that any measures are fully aligned with the strategic imperatives prevailing at the time they are set.
The performance condition applicable to the VCP award has been selected by the Committee on the basis that share price is the best indicator of how the market values the efficiency with which the management team uses the available capital so it implicitly recognises only those activities that are valueenhancing.
In addition the Committee considers the Plan provides stronger alignment between Executives and shareholders since the participants will share directly in the growth of the Company albeit only for meeting stretching targets a simple and transparent incentive focused on the achievement of high levels of growth in shareholder value and a genuinely longterm fiveyear performance period single measurement which ensures performance is sustained.
The Committee operates the annual bonus plan and longterm incentive plans per their respective rules and consistent with normal market practice the Listing Rules and HMRC rules where relevant including flexibility in a number of regards.
These include timing of awards and payments the size of an award within the limits noted in the Policy Table and when and how much should vest who receives an award or payment dealing with a change of control or restructuring of the Group determining whether a participant is a goodbad leaver for incentive plan purposes and whether and what proportion of awards vest any adjustments required to awards in certain circumstances for example rights issues corporate restructuring events and special dividends and the weightings measures and targets for the annual bonus plan and LTIP from year to year.
The Committee retains the discretion to adjust the targets andor set different measures and alter weightings for the annual bonus plan and to adjust targets for the LTIP if events occur e. materially less difficult to satisfy.
Existing awards The Committee intends to honour any commitments including outstanding LTIP awards other than the awards granted in March 2017 which lapsed as a condition of participation in the VCP during 2017 on the terms applicable at the time each such commitment was made.
Policy on contracts of service It is the Committees policy for the notice periods of Executive Directors to be twelve months or less.
In the event of termination the Committees policy is that payments on termination should reflect the specific circumstances prevailing.
In general it would be the Committees policy to make a payment in lieu of notice where necessary limited to base salary and benefits.
To the extent that an individual might otherwise seek to bring a claim against the Company in relation to the termination of their employment e.
Committee retains the right to make an appropriate payment in settlement of such potential or actual claims.
Sportech Annual Report Pt5 Sportech Annual Report Pt5 Page 55 Sportech PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Report of the Remuneration Committee continued Payments in connection with any statutory entitlements for example in relation to redundancy may be made as required.
In connection with the foregoing the Committee reserves the right to award to an Executive Director a bonus in respect of the period of the year in which notice of termination had not been served and in certain exceptional circumstances in respect of any period following receipt of notice of resignation that the individual remained in employment subject to the appropriate performance measures being achieved.
The determination of any share incentive vesting would be subject to the rules of the relevant plan but in general where an individual is a good leaver e.
Committee decides the award should continue to the original vesting date and remain subject to the appropriate performance measures being achieved and time pro rating unless the Committee decides it is inappropriate to apply time pro rating.
The Committee would intend to apply the above policy for any new appointment which may include the ability to make phased payments with mitigation.
Copies of the Executive Directors service contracts are available for inspection on request to the Company Secretary.
The Nonexecutive Directors have letters of appointment which provide for notice by either party giving to the other not less than three months notice in writing.
The Company may also terminate by making a payment in lieu of notice.
Policy on external appointments Sportech PLC recognises that its Directors are likely to be invited to become Nonexecutive Directors of other companies and that such exposure can broaden experience and knowledge which will benefit the
Executive Directors are therefore allowed to accept Nonexecutive appointments and retain any fees earned with the Boards prior permission if these are not likely to lead to conflicts of interest.
Other employees pay The Committee does not consult with employees directly on matters of Executive remuneration.
However the Committee is aware of the disconnect which can be created if Executive Director remuneration is set in isolation.
The Committee therefore regularly interacts with the senior operational executives and monitors pay trends and conditions across the workforce.
In particular the Committee is made aware of general salary increases general benefit provision and the proposed level of annual bonuses.
Salary increases will ordinarily be in percentage of salary terms in line with those of the wider workforce.
The Committee is also responsible for reviewing the participants of the LTIPs the VCP and participation levels in the all employee plans.
Sportech Annual Report Pt5 Sportech Annual Report Pt5 Page 56 57 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Policy on Executive Director recruitmentspromotions In relation to an external executive recruitment or an internal promotion the Committee will follow the principles outlined in the table below Element of remuneration Policy Base salary Salary levels will be set based on the particular experience knowledge and skill of the individual market rates for comparable positions in companies of a similar size and complexity and internal Company relativities.
Where considered appropriate the Committee may wish to set the initial salary below the market rate but with the view to make a series of planned phased increases potentially above those of the wider workforce as a percentage of salary to achieve the desired market positioning over time.
Any increases would be subject to the individuals continued development and performance in the role.
Benefits A new appointment would be offered the same benefits package or equivalent in line with local market practice as that provided to current Executive Directors.
Where considered necessary the Committee may be required to pay certain relocation expenses legal fees and other costs incurred by the individual in relation to their appointment.
Pension A defined contribution or cash supplement or equivalent in line with local market practice at up to the level provided to current Executive Directors may be provided.
Annual bonus The Committee would envisage the annual bonus for any new appointment operating as set out in the Policy Table for current Executive Directors.
However the Committee may consider it necessary depending on timing and the nature of the appointment to set different tailored performance measures for the initial bonus year.
Longterm incentives A new Executive Director may be entitled to participate in the VCP albeit potentially with different performance awards and depending on the timing of the appointment.
An award may be made shortly after an appointment.
For internal promotions existing awards will continue over their original vesting period and remain subject to their terms as at the date of grant.
Buyout awards To facilitate an external recruitment it may be necessary to buy out remuneration which would be forfeited on the appointee leaving their previous employer.
When determining the quantum and structure of any buyout awards the Committee will where possible use a consistent basis taking into account the form of remuneration cash or shares timing horizons and the application of any performance criteria.
Any buyout awards will be addition to the limits set out above.
Buyout awards if used will be granted using the Companys existing share plans to the extent possible although awards may also be granted outside of these schemes if necessary and as permitted under the Listing Rules.
Sportech Annual Report Pt5 Sportech Annual Report Pt5 Page 57 Sportech PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Report of the Remuneration Committee continued The fee structure and quantum for NonExecutive Director appointments will be based on the prevailing NonExecutive Director fee policy.
Shareholder engagement The Committee is mindful of the concerns of shareholders and stakeholders and considers an open and constructive dialogue with investors to be vitally important to establishing a successful remuneration policy which is considered fair by both Executives and shareholders.
The Committee will consult with major investors whenever material changes to the policy are proposed.
The Committee also welcomes investor feedback and will consider views raised at the AGM and during regular meetings throughout the year and this plus any additional feedback received from time to time is considered as part of the Committees annual review of remuneration policy.
The Committee also closely monitors developments in institutional investors best practice expectations.

The sustainable financial based proportion of the potential bonus which represents a majority of Andrews bonus entitlement is operated with a range set around an agreed budgeted objective.
Strategic and personal objectives are designed to protect and enhance the Companys position across key geographical regions and enhance shareholder value.
The objectives themselves are considered commercially sensitive and will therefore be disclosed on a retrospective basis in next years annual report on remuneration as long as such targets are no longer considered commercially sensitive at that point.
This bonus is wholly payable in cash.
Recovery provisions may be applied in the event of material misconduct andor an error in the calculation of the bonus payable.

LongTerm Incentive Plan and Value Creation Plan LTIP and VCP The VCP was introduced in 2017 to replace the Performance Share Plan PSP.
It is currently intended that no further awards will be made to executive directors under the PSP.
Awards under the VCP were first made in 2017 and it is intended that these awards will be oneoff in nature to cover the fiveyear vesting period of the plan.
The
Committee retains the right to make further awards from the shareholder approved pool and limits to personnel identified as key to delivering incremental value or executing a strategy to deliver tangible returns.

In connection with the awards to the Executive Directors the primary performance metric was the Companys relative TSR performance subject to the application of a general financial performance modifier to ensure that financial performance is taken into account when determining the vesting of such awards.
The PSP awards granted during 2017 were surrendered in full in exchange for eligibility to receive awards under the VCP as detailed below.
LongTerm Incentive Plans LTIPs Awards vested in relation to performance ending 2017 Awards granted in March 2015 reached the end of their performance periods or were substantially complete in the year under review.
This includes 50% of awards subject to relative TSR performance period measured to 9 March 2018 and 50% of awards subject to Earnings per Share EPS performance period ended 31 December 2017.
Summary details of the full conditions applying to the 2015 awards are included as a footnote to the PSP table on page 64.
The assessment of the TSR measure was made independently by New Bridge Street who advised that TSR over the threeyear performance period to 9 March 2018 was 68.5% which resulted in the Company being ranked above the upper quartile position on a relative basis.
As a result 100% of this part of the award will be eligible to vest.
The increase in adjusted EPS during the threeyear period to 31 December 2017 was below the threshold target level and therefore no part of this award will be eligible to vest.
Sportech Annual Report Pt5 Sportech Annual Report Pt5 Page 62 63 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements The performance period for the 2017 Award comprises the five years commencing on 1 January 2017.
The VCP provides Participants including the Executive Directors with a pool of ordinary shares with a value equal to 20% of any cumulative shareholder value created above a compound hurdle rate of 8% per annum.
However in the event of a change of control that results in accelerated vesting in 2017 or 2018 or in the case of an Executive Director being deemed a Good Leaver as defined in the VCP rules in 2017 or 2018 the compound hurdle rates for vesting will be 12% and 10% respectively.
The Chief Executive Chief Financial Officer and President Sportech Racing and Digital share 50% of this pool.
This will be measured from a base ordinary share price of 95 pence being the base level of the 2017 LTIP award as at the start of the Performance Period.
The Committee will have the discretion to settle up to 50% of Awards in cash.
A clawback provision is in place whereby the Committee may require a Participant to transfer to the Company all or some of the ordinary shares acquired or pay certain amounts to the Company in the period of two years following the vesting of an Award where the Committee determines that one or more of the following trigger events have occurred the discovery of a material misstatement resulting in an adjustment in the audited consolidated accounts of the Company or the audited accounts of any Group company andor action or conduct of a Participant which in the reasonable opinion of the Committee amounts to fraud or gross misconduct.

Disclosure of information to Auditors So far as each Director is aware at the date of the approval of the financial statements there is no relevant audit information of which the Companys Auditors are unaware.
Each Director has taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a Director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Group and Companys Auditors are aware of that information.
The Auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have indicated their willingness to continue in office and a resolution that they be reappointed will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.

Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing these financial statements the Directors are required to select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union have been followed subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Company will continue in business.

On behalf of the Board Richard Cooper Company Secretary 23 April 2018 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Sportech Annual Report Pt5 Sportech Annual Report Pt5 Page 73 Sportech PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Independent Auditors Report to the Members of Sportech PLC Report on the audit of the financial statements
In our opinion Sportech PLCs group financial statements and company financial statements the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Groups and of the companys affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the Groups loss and the Groups and the companys cash flows for the year then ended have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as regards the companys financial statements as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and as regards the group financial statements Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements included within the Annual Report and accounts 2017 the Annual Report which comprise the group and company Balance Sheets as at 31 December 2017 the Income Statement and Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year then ended the group and company statements of Cash Flows for the year then ended the group and company Statements of Changes in Equity for the year then ended and the accounting policies and the notes to the financial statements.
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.
Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing UK ISAs UK and applicable law.
Our responsibilities under ISAs UK are further described in the Auditors responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK which includes the FRCs Ethical Standard as applicable to listed public interest entities and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief we declare that nonaudit services prohibited by the FRCs Ethical Standard were not provided to the group or the parent company.
Other than those disclosed in note 7 to the financial statements we have provided no nonaudit services to the group or the parent company in the period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017.
Sportech Annual Report Pt5 Sportech Annual Report Pt5 Page 74 Our audit approach
Overall Group materiality 230000 2016 590000 based on 0.35% of revenue 2016 based on 2.5% of adjusted EBITDA being earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation as adjusted for exceptional items impairment of assets and share option charges.
Overall company materiality 430000 2016 417000 based on 0.5% of Net assets Our audit focussed on the reporting packs for the key reporting units being Sportech PLC the parent company Sportech Pools Limited formerly The Football Pools Limited Sportech Racing LLC Sportech Venues Inc and Racing Technology Ireland Limited.
The components where we performed audit procedures accounted for 86% of Group revenue and 80% of Group adjusted EBITDA.
Intangible asset impairment Group Provision for uncertain tax provisions Group Recoverability of contingent consideration Group The scope of our audit As part of designing our audit we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements.
In particular we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.
We gained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the group and the industry in which it operates and considered the risk of acts by the group which were contrary to applicable laws and regulations including fraud.
We designed audit procedures at group and significant component level to respond to the risk recognising that the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by for example forgery or intentional misrepresentations or through collusion.
We focussed on laws and regulations that could give rise to a material misstatement in the group and parent company financial statements including but not limited to the Companies Act 2006 the Listing Rules Pensions legislation US Gaming Regulations and UK and US tax legislation.
Our tests included but were not limited to review of the financial statement disclosures to underlying supporting documentation review of correspondence with regulators review of correspondence with legal and tax advisors and enquiries of management.
There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above and the further removed noncompliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements the less likely we would become aware of it.
We did not identify any key audit matters relating to irregularities including fraud.
As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls including testing journals and evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
Key audit matters Audit scope
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Sportech Annual Report Pt5 Sportech Annual Report Pt5 Page 75 Sportech PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Independent Auditors Report to the Members of Sportech PLC continued Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that in the auditors professional judgement were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement whether or not due to fraud identified by the auditors including those which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter We evaluated and challenged the Directors future cash flow forecasts together with the process by which they were drawn up and the key assumptions made and tested the underlying valueinuse calculation.
We noted no material inconsistencies between the forecasts and our understanding of the Boards approved future plans for the business gained from other areas of our audit.
We evaluated the key assumptions over the net handle generated by the land based venues in 2017 and beyond by reference to the trend in total handle in recent years after removing the impact of one off events.
We have evaluated the growth assumptions adopted by the directors in respect of online handle via reference to historic growth rates.
We have also assessed the reasonableness of the directors forecasts for the profitability of the Bobby Vs Stamford venue with reference to the current performance of the venue and other more established venues.
The directors assumptions are supported by information currently available.
In addition we have evaluated the discount rate used within the impairment review to assess whether it is appropriate.
This was done primarily by comparison to the weighted average cost of capital of other comparable companies within the same industry or with a similar business model.
The discount rate was found to be supportable.
Whilst inherent uncertainty exists around many of the key assumptions used by the directors in the impairment review our procedures indicated that the key assumptions were supportable and reasonable within the context of the evidence we obtained.
We did not identify any material inconsistencies in the directors estimation techniques and forecasting in these areas.
Intangible asset impairment Refer to page 42 Audit Committee Report page 92 Significant Accounting Policies and page 112 notes Intangible assets associated with the gaming licence held within Sportech Venues Inc.
Venues have a carrying value of 5.6m following the recognition of a 12.0m impairment in the year.
In arriving at the remaining carrying value the directors have assumed that the level of net handle the total value of bets taken generated by the land based venues will continue its recent decline falling by 2% per year on average from 2018 onwards.
Further they have assumed the level of net handle in respect of internet gambling in Connecticut will grow on average 5% between 2018 and 2022 then at a rate of 2% into perpetuity.
Finally the directors have made assumptions in respect of the growth in profitability of the newly opened Bobby Vs Stamford venue both in respect of the level of handle generated and the food and beverage sales which are set out in detail within note 13.
We focussed on these areas due to the judgments and estimates involved.
Sportech Annual Report Pt5 Sportech Annual Report Pt5 Page 76 Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter Uncertain tax provisions Furthermore we performed sensitivity analysis to assess whether reasonably possible changes to key assumptions could result in a further impairment.
We determined that while the directors assumptions are not inappropriate reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions would be likely to lead to a material further impairment.
We have determined that the directors disclosure see note 13 appropriately reflects this fact and is consistent with the requirements of accounting standards.
We have evaluated the directors conclusions surrounding whether a provision is required in respect of these uncertain tax provisions and where applicable the judgements adopted in determining the quantum of the provision and related disclosures.
Football Pools disposal In respect of the calculation of tax on disposal of the Football Pools division we obtained managements intangible asset valuation model and assessed the appropriateness of the methodology and assumptions adopted in determining the valuation to be assigned to each of the intangibles disposed of.
We also evaluated the judgements adopted by the directors in determining the period in which those intangibles arose in the context of our understanding of the Group.
We performed sensitivity analysis to assess the potential incremental tax liability should different assumptions be adopted.
We determined that while the directors assumptions are supportable there were alterative judgements which could result in a materially different tax charge and hence agree that the directors disclosures see note 26 adequately reflect this.
Spot the ball income In respect of the taxation of the Spot the ball income we have understood the relevant tax legislation recalculated the tax payable based on the assumptions adopted by management reviewed correspondence with HMRC and consulted with tax specialists to assess the appropriateness of the position taken by management.
On balance we consider the judgement taken to be supportable.
Refer to page 42 Audit Committee Report page 92 Significant Accounting Policies and pages 109 and 129 notes.
Over recent years the business has experienced a number of one off transactions that have significant tax implications.
These include the disposal of the Football Pools division and the gain arising from the successful Spot the Ball claim.
Football Pools disposal The disposal of the Football Pools division was structured as a share sale of three companies and sales of the core business trade and assets of other companies which remain in the Group.
The total tax charge resulting from the sale of the Football Pools division has been estimated by management as 6.4m see note 10.
Where certain intangible assets are disposed of by the Group the quantum of the tax liability which crystallises is subject to management judgement both in respect of the allocation of the consideration to the assets disposed of the value of those assets and the periods in which those assets arose.
Spot the ball income The tax in respect of the net Spot the Ball exceptional income recognised in the prior year was provided at 20% being the UK tax rate enacted for the year ending 31 December 2016.
It is possible that capital losses can be offset against the gain to reduce the tax on this gain.
A judgement therefore exists as to whether a provision is required for the 4.6m which could be reduced to nil should the conclusion be reached that it is appropriate to treat the gain as a capital gain.
The directors have determined that is appropriate to provide for this amount in full on the basis of probability.
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Sportech Annual Report Pt5 Sportech Annual Report Pt5 Page 77 Sportech PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Independent Auditors Report to the Members of Sportech PLC continued Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter We determined that there were no key audit matters applicable to the company to communicate in our report.
How we tailored the audit scope We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole taking into account the structure of the group and the company the accounting processes and controls and the industry in which they operate.
The Group is managed divisionally with the three operating divisions being Football Pools until its sale in June 2017 Racing and Digital and Venues with the head office function incurring certain central costs on behalf of the Group.
The Groups accounting structure includes a local finance function in each of these divisions.
These functions maintain their own localised accounting records and controls distinct from those at the head office level.
HMRC VAT challenge In respect of the VAT claim we have reviewed the advice that the directors have received from their external tax and legal advisors and evaluated the supporting calculations which have been prepared by management in reaching their conclusion that no provision is required.
Whilst the future outcome of the appeal against HMRC is uncertain we determined that the directors judgement in respect of this item is reasonable.
Further we have confirmed that the contingent liability in respect of this item is appropriately disclosed see note 26.
HMRC VAT challenge In addition during 2017 Sportech PLC has received a challenge from HMRC in respect of the value of economic activities that they provide to their trading subsidiaries including the exempt Football Pools business.
Assessments have been received totalling 1.3m for the period ended 31 December 2015.
The directors have determined on the basis of legal and tax advice that no provision is required in respect of this assessment or for any subsequent periods.
Together these create a number of material tax judgements and we have therefore focussed on the assumptions adopted by management in determining the appropriate provisions required as at the 31 December 2017.
We have evaluated the directors conclusions surrounding the likelihood of this contingent amount being received.
This has focussed on the likelihood of NYX obtaining the additional three new customers within the remaining two and a half years for the consideration to be payable.
During our assessment we have considered a number of factors which are relevant to NYX acquiring new customers in the remaining period.
These factors include the passage of gambling deregulation through certain states within the USA in the year the number of credible competitors to NYX in those states and the pre existing relationships NYX has with a number of potential customers which increase the likelihood of a new customer being acquired.
We verified these factors through external research over the regulatory and competitive environment in the USA in this industry.
Whilst there is an inherent amount of uncertainty within the directors assumptions in respect of this item we have concluded that at this time the directors judgement is reasonable.
Recoverability of contingent consideration receivable Refer to page 42 Audit Committee Report page 92 Significant Accounting Policies and page 127 notes.
In May 2015 the Group disposed of its 50% investment in Sportech  NYX Gaming LLC.
Included within the consideration receivable by the Group for the sale was an amount which is contingent on the buyer NYX Gaming Group limited NYX acquiring three new customers in the five years subsequent to the disposal.
The directors assumed and continue to assume that the conditions for receipt of these amounts will be met within the requisite period and that the consideration will be received.
As such this amount 1.5m continues to be included within trade and other receivables as at 31 December 2017.
Given the judgement over the likelihood of this amount being received we have focussed on the directors assumptions in respect of this consideration.
Sportech Annual Report Pt5 Sportech Annual Report Pt5 Page 78 The directors operate the Group divisionally and so we have scoped our audit at a reporting level.
The Group comprises 19 reporting units.
We performed full scope audits over five reporting units being Sportech PLC the Parent Company Sportech Pools Limited formerly The Football Pools Limited Sportech Racing LLC Sportech Venues Inc and Racing Technology Ireland Limited which we regarded as being financially significant components of the Group given their contribution to the Groups revenue and adjusted EBITDA.
The entities that were subject to audit work accounted for 86% of the Groups revenue from continuing operations and 80% of the Groups adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations.
Additionally we performed work in another eight reporting units on specific balances that we regarded to be significant to the consolidated financial statements.
We have performed sufficient testing over divisional and head office finance functions to obtain evidence over the components in scope for our Group audit.
Furthermore we have performed procedures over the Groups consolidation of these entities and significant consolidation entries.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality.
We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality.
These together with qualitative considerations helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows Group financial statements Company financial statements Overall materiality 230000 2016 590000.
430000 2016 417000.
How we determined it 0.35% of revenue.
0.5% of Net assets.
Rationale for benchmark applied Net assets is considered to be appropriate as it is not a profit oriented company.
The main source of income is dividend income provided by other Group companies.
The company holds all investments in subsidiaries and therefore net assets is deemed a generally accepted auditing benchmark.
In considering an appropriate benchmark on which to base our determination of materiality we took into account that the Group has undergone significant changes during the year most notably with the sale of the Football Pools business which represented a significant proportion of the Groups adjusted EBITDA.
Given the significant downsizing of the Group the Groups cost base during the year ending 31 December 2017 was not representative of a Group of a similar size.
The Group has undergone a cost reduction exercise in the year such that the underlying cost base will be reduced going forward.
We therefore consider revenue the most appropriate benchmark on which to base our materiality.
Applying our professional judgement based on the scale of the business we determined an overall materiality of 230000 which represents 0.35% of revenue.
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Sportech Annual Report Pt5 Sportech Annual Report Pt5 Page 79 Sportech PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Independent Auditors Report to the Members of Sportech PLC continued For each component in the scope of our group audit we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality.
The range of materiality allocated across components was between 68000 and 215000.
Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above 10000 Group audit 2016 30000 and 21000 Company audit 2016 21000 as well as misstatements below those amounts that in our view warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern In accordance with ISAs UK we report as follows Reporting obligation Outcome Reporting on other information The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors report thereon.
The directors are responsible for the other information.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and accordingly we do not express an audit opinion or except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report any form of assurance thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements our responsibility is to read the other information and in doing so consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information.
If based on the work we have performed we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report Directors Report and Corporate Governance Statement we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit the Companies Act 2006 CA06 ISAs UK and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority FCA require us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below required by ISAs UK unless otherwise stated.
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to.
However because not all future events or conditions can be predicted this statement is not a guarantee as to the groups and companys ability to continue as a going concern.
We are required to report if we have anything material to add or draw attention to in respect of the directors statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements and the directors identification of any material uncertainties to the groups and the companys ability to continue as a going concern over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
We have nothing to report.
We are required to report if the directors statement relating to Going Concern in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R3 is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.

We have nothing to report having performed a review of the directors statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group and statement in relation to the longerterm viability of the Group.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors Responsibilities set out on page 72 the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements the directors are responsible for assessing the groups and the companys ability to continue as a going concern disclosing as applicable matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the company or to cease operations or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditors report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs UK will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if individually or in the aggregate they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

The Companys registered office is Collins House Rutland Square Edinburgh Midlothian Scotland EH1 2AA.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 comprise the Company its subsidiaries joint ventures and associates together referred to as the Group.
The principal activities of the Group are parimutuel betting both B2B and B2C and supply of wagering technology solutions.
Going concern As discussed in the Directors report on page 71 the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the period to 30 June 2019.
Accordingly they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Basis of accounting These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs and International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee IFRIC interpretations as adopted by the European Union IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRSs.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments and available for sale financial assets to fair value in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments Recognition and measurement.
The Groups accounting policies have been set by management and approved by the Audit Committee.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount event or actions actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
Amounts presented in the financial statements have been rounded to the nearest 1000.
Critical judgements and estimates Critical judgements and estimates have been made in the following areas Carrying value of Sportech Venues intangible assets To determine whether an impairment of the intangible assets held by the Sportech Venues division has occurred the key assumptions the Group uses in estimating future cash flows for valueinuse measures are success of newlybuilt venues in growing both its handle and FandB earnings rates of industry handle growthdecline impacting the retail and online product discount rates which appropriately reflect the risks associated with those specific cashgenerating units
These assumptions and the judgements of management that are based on them are subject to change as new information becomes available.
Economic conditions and government policy changes can also impact on the assumption and discount rates applied which are reviewed annually.
Further details are disclosed within note 13 of the Annual Report.
Consolidated Financial Statements continued Sportech Annual Report Pt6 Sportech Annual Report Pt6 Page 92 93 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Carrying value of contingent consideration receivable An element of the consideration received on the disposal of SportechNYX Gaming LLC is contingent upon NYX Gaming Group Limited NYX customers going live on their Real Money Wagering Platform.
Judgement is therefore applied by management as to the likelihood that customers will golive on this platform and the number of customers who do so see note 25.
Changes to market conditions including regulatory change and competition from other online gaming suppliers are the key assumptions used in making these judgements.
Management are confident that the assumptions applied represent the best estimate of the amount receivable by the Group for future customer acquisitions made by NYX.
Tax
The Groups activities in recent periods have resulted in material tax liabilities crystallising.
The ultimate tax liability due in all instances is subject to a degree of judgment.
The judgments which are made are done so in good faith with the aim of always paying the correct amount of tax at the appropriate time.
Management work diligently with the Groups external financial advisors in quantifying the anticipated accurate and fair tax liability which arises from material oneoff events such as the Spot the Ball legal case and the disposal of the Football
Critical judgments include the valuation of assets disposed of in the Football Pools deal the period in which those assets arose and the valuation of management supplies provided by the Executive management team to its subsidiaries.
The use of capital losses to offset the Spot the Ball gain is also a critical judgment and the uncertainty of this results in a provision of 4.6m of corporation tax continuing to be carried in respect of this.
Further detail is provided in notes 9 10 and 26.
A summary of more important Group accounting policies follows.
These policies have been applied consistently to all the years presented.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control.
Control of an entity is deemed to exist when the Group is exposed to or has rights to variable returns through its power over that entity.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets given equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange.
The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement.
Contingent consideration is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date and remeasured at each balance sheet date until settlement.
The revaluation amount is debitedcredited to the income statement in the period in which the estimated fair value is increaseddecreased.
Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred.
Identifiable
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Transactions between subsidiaries are performed on an armslength basis.
Intercompany transactions balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated but considered an impairment indicator of the asset transferred.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Sportech Annual Report Pt6 Sportech Annual Report Pt6 Page 93 b Equity accounted investees The Group equity accounts for any investees which are considered to be either a joint venture or an associate.
A joint venture is an entity which is jointly controlled by the Group and one or more venturers under a contractual agreement.
An associate is an entity in which the Group has no control nor joint control but bears significant influence over that entity.
In both cases the Group holds its interest in the entity on a longterm basis.
The Groups share of postacquisition profits and losses made by the investee is recognised in the income statement and its share of postacquisition movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income.
The cumulative postacquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment.
When the Groups share of losses in an equityaccounted investee equals or exceeds its interest in that entity including any other unsecured receivables the Group does not recognise further losses unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its equity accounted investees are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in that entity.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
The accounting policies of the investee have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Revenue
Revenue from external customers net of VAT excise duties returns rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group represents the value of entry fees net of winnings paid receivable in respect of Football Pools recognised on the date of the event the value of stakes net of winnings paid received in relation to betting activities recognised on the date of the event the value of goods and services sold to external customers is recognised when the goods and services are consumed the sale of terminals and systems recognised when significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred which is when title passes to the customer generally being at the point of customer acceptance.
Sales which involve significant customisation are recognised on a percentage of completion basis in accordance with IAS 11 and the value of services delivered under service contracts generally based on either a percentage of amounts wagered or on a predetermined fixed amount depending on contract terms.
Although the value of entry fees net of winnings paid and the value of bets net of winnings paid is reported as revenue both meet the definition of a gain under IAS 39 Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement.
Under multiple element arrangements revenue is allocated to the various elements based on fair value determined by the price charged when the same element is sold separately and revenue is recognised on the separate components of the contract in accordance with the appropriate revenue recognition policy for that item or service.
Deferred income Deferred income includes the value of stakes placed prior to the end of the financial period in respect of competitions and sporting events held subsequent to the end of the financial period and income received in advance of a service or product being delivered.
Sportech PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements continued Sportech Annual Report Pt6 Sportech Annual Report Pt6 Page 94 95 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Segmental reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decisionmaker.
The chief operating decisionmaker who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments has been identified as the Executive Committee which makes strategic and operational decisions.
The Group has identified its business segments as follows Sportech Racing and Digital provision of parimutuel wagering services and systems worldwide principally to the horseracing industry Sportech Venues offtrack betting venue management and Corporate costs central costs relating to the Company in its capacity as the holding company of the
Taxation
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
In this case the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.
Deferred income tax is provided in full using the liability method on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
However the deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
Sportech Annual Report Pt6 Sportech Annual Report Pt6 Page 95 g Foreign currencies Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling  which is the Companys functional currency and the Groups presentation currency.
Transactions and balances Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement except where deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges.
Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the income statement within finance income or costs.
All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the income statement within operating profit.
Group companies The results and financial position of all the Group entities none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions and all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Property plant and equipment Property plant and equipment are carried at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable in bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use and any associated borrowing costs.
Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until the asset is completed.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset as appropriate only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised.
All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within administrative expenses in the income statement.
Assets in the course of construction are capitalised when first brought into use and depreciated from this date.
Sportech PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements continued Sportech Annual Report Pt6 Sportech Annual Report Pt6 Page 96 97 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Depreciation is provided on a straightline basis to write off the cost of property plant and equipment down to residual value over their anticipated useful lives at the following annual rates Long leasehold and owned land Not depreciated Long leasehold and owned buildings 4.0% to 5.0% Short leasehold land and buildings Over the period of the lease Plant equipment and other fixtures and fittings 10.0% to 33.3% Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until they are ready for use.
The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at each balance sheet date.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the fair value of consideration given over the fair value of the separately identifiable net assets acquired.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs 4 January 2005 has been frozen at the previous UK GAAP net book value at the date of transition subject to being tested for impairment annually at the year end date.
Goodwill is allocated to specific CGUs for the purpose of impairment testing.
The allocation is made to the CGU that is expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible fixed assets Intangible fixed assets are held at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment.
Amortisation is charged on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the intangible fixed asset.
Software
Externally acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software.
These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives or contractual period if shorter six to ten years.
Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group are recognised as intangible assets when the following criteria are met it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use management intends to complete the software product it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits adequate technical financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the software product are available and the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured.
Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software product include the software development employee costs and an appropriate proportion of relevant overhead.
Other development expenditure that does not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.
Software development costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives which do not exceed 15 years.
Licences
Licences acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Licences that have a finite useful life are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is calculated using the straightline method to allocate cost of licences over their estimated useful lives of 15 to 20 years.
Licences with an infinite life licences granted in perpetuity are held at cost or fair value at acquisition date and tested annually for impairment.
Sportech Annual Report Pt6 Sportech Annual Report Pt6 Page 97 l Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are carried at historic cost less any impairment.
Annual impairment reviews are performed.
Impairment reviews Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to an annual review for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and valueinuse.
For the purpose of assessing impairments assets are grouped at the lowest levels at which there are separately identifiable cash flows.
Any impairment losses are recognised in the income statement in the year in which they occur.
Any impairment loss recognised on goodwill is not reversed.
All other individual assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
With the exception of goodwill all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist at each reporting date.
Pension obligation The Group operates various pension schemes.
The schemes are generally funded through payments to insurance companies or Trustee administered funds determined by periodic actuarial calculations.
The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that is not a defined contribution plan.
Typically defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement usually dependent on one or more factors such as age years of service and compensation.
The asset or liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the defined benefit pension plan is the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement.
For defined contribution plans the Group pays contributions to privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory contractual or voluntary basis.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available.
Sportech PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements continued Sportech Annual Report Pt6 Sportech Annual Report Pt6 Page 98 99 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to interest rate and exchange rate movements.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet initially at fair value when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Subsequent measurement depends on the designation of the instrument in accordance with IAS 39.
Available for sale financial assets Financial assets which do not meet the criteria of being loans and receivables fair value through profit and loss or held to maturity financial assets are classified as available for sale financial assets in accordance with IAS 39.
Those assets are remeasured to their fair value at the reporting date with any gainslosses recognised within other comprehensive income.
An available for sale financial asset reserve holds all unrealised gainslosses within equity on the balance sheet.
Gainslosses on available for sale financial assets are realised at the point that the asset is disposed of by the
Sharebased payments The fair value of employee options awarded under the Value Creation Plan is calculated using the BlackScholes model.
The fair value of employee PSP awards is valued using a stochastic Monte Carlo valuation model.
In accordance with IFRS 2 Sharebased Payment the resulting cost is charged to the income statement over the vesting period of the optionsawards.
The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the optionsawards granted including any market performance conditions which are those that are based on Sportech PLCs share price and excluding the impact of any service and nonmarket performance vesting conditions being profitability and the individual remaining an employee over a specified time period.
At each balance sheet date the Company revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates if any in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The charge in relation to employees who provide services to subsidiary companies is recharged to those subsidiaries.
Where the charge is not required to be settled in cash the Companys investment in that subsidiary is increased by the value of the charge and a corresponding increase in equity is recognised in the subsidiary.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents shown on the balance sheet represent cash in hand cash in vaults and cash held in current accounts both owned by the Group and held on behalf of customers.
Any bank overdrafts used by the Group are shown within trade and other payables.
Positive cash balances and overdrafts are only offset within cash and cash equivalents to the extent that they form part of a cashpooling arrangement implemented by the Group where the balances will be settled on a net basis.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the balance sheet date.
Exceptional items The Group defines exceptional items as those items which by their nature or size would distort the comparability of the Groups results from year to year.
Sportech Annual Report Pt6 Sportech Annual Report Pt6 Page 99 t Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less provision for impairment being the difference between the assets carrying amounts and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate.
Individually significant receivables are considered for impairment when they are past due or when other objective evidence is received that a specific customer will default or delinquency in payment will arise.
Any subsequent recovery of amounts written off is credited to the income statement.
Trade payables Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined using the first in first out method.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business.
Provisions
Provisions for onerous contracts onerous leases legal claims and dilapidations are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses where the Group has no contractual obligation to deliver the service or product.
Provisions payable over a period greater than 12 months are discounted using an appropriate market riskfree discount rate.
Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases net of any incentives received from the lessor are charged to the income statement on a straightline basis over the period of the lease.
Share capital Ordinary shares are classed as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the value of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds in the share premium account where the shares were issued at a premium or where issued at par or where the issue costs exceed the premium on the issue to retained earnings.

Sportech PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements continued Sportech Annual Report Pt6 Sportech Annual Report Pt6 Page 100 101 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Adjusted Performance Measures The Executive Committee assesses the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of adjusted EBITDA which excludes the effects of nonrecurring expenditure such as exceptional items and asset impairment charges.
The share option expense is also excluded.
Interest is not allocated to segments as the Groups cash position is controlled by the central finance team.
This measure provides the most reliable indicator of underlying performance of each of the trading divisions.
This is considered the most reliable indicator as it is the closest approximation to cash generated by underlying trade excluding the impact of oneoff items of a material nature and working capital movements.
Adjusted EBITDA is not an IFRS measure nevertheless it is widely used by both the analyst community to compare with other gaming companies and by management to assess underlying performance.

Sportech Annual Report Pt6 Sportech Annual Report Pt6 Page 101 Sportech PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements continued Adjusted profit is also an adjusted performance measure used by the Group.
This uses adjusted EBITDA as defined above as managements view of the closest proxy to cash generation for underlying divisional performance and deducting share option charges depreciation amortisation of intangible assets other than those which arise in the acquisition of businesses and finance charges.
This provides an adjusted profit before tax measure which is then taxed by applying an estimated adjusted tax measure.
The adjusted tax charge excludes the tax impact of income statement items not included in adjusted profit before tax.

Certain adjustments in respect of prior years are UK debtcap adjustments that are made within the UK corporation tax Group.
This Group includes Sportech PLC and other companies whose results have been presented as discontinued operations in the year see note 10.
The net cash impact of those adjustments on the Groups corporation tax liability is nil.
US deferred tax assets have been revalued downwards to allow for the reduction in the federal US tax rate from 34% to 21% thus impacting the future cash benefit the Group will receive from carrying its US tax losses.
Deferred tax assets of 383k have not been recognised in respect of the investment made by the Group in SandS Venues California LLC.
Tax losses are only realisable in the event of a sale of this investment at a profit.
Management have insufficient certainty that this will occur and so those items have not been recognised as deferred tax assets.
As the Groups year end is after the substantive enactment date 15 September 2016 of the Finance Act 2016 these financial statements account for the change in the UK Corporation Tax rate from 19% to 17% for financial years beginning 1 April 2020.
Therefore the rate at which UK deferred tax is calculated has changed.
Deferred tax in the UK is provided at a blended rate depending on when the deferred tax is expected to unwind.
As disclosed in the 2016 financial statements tax on the net Spot the Ball exceptional income was provided for at 20%.
It is possible that capital losses of 23.0m could be used to offset the gain to reduce the tax on this gain by 4.6m.
The entire tax liability other than this 4.6m has now been paid.
The 4.6m remains provided for in current tax liabilities in the year end financial statements as an uncertain tax position.
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Sportech Annual Report Pt6 Sportech Annual Report Pt6 Page 109 Sportech PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements continued Discontinued operations The disposal of the Football Pools business completed in June 2017 and the Board considered its Venues business in the Netherlands Sportech Racing BV and subsidiaries to be an asset held for sale with a sale being considered probable within 12 months from the reporting date.
Accordingly both those divisions are reported as discontinued operations in the 2017 financial statements.
A reconciliation of the net loss on discontinued operations is shown below.

Where certain intangible assets are disposed of by the Group a tax liability crystallises the quantum of which is subject to management judgment.
That judgment includes consideration of the assets which are disposed of the value of those assets and the period in which those assets arose.
The total tax charge which arises in the period includes 6395k which is directly attributable to the sale of those assets see note 26.
This was paid in full in 2017.
Note that the net gainloss on disposal in relation to the Venues business in the Netherlands is not recognised until the sale is completed which is anticipated to occur within 2018.
Further detail on this prospective disposal can be found in note 19.
It is anticipated that a net gain on disposal will be recognised in the 2018 financial statements for this business of approximately 0.9m with further potential upside available as disclosed in note 19.

Amortisation and impairment charges for continuing operations have been included within operating costs.
It was identified during the period that items with a cost of 221k were presented within property plant and equipment but were of an intangible nature.
Those items have been transferred to software.
Impairment  Licences The Group holds a licence in perpetuity to offer parimutuel offtrack betting in the State of Connecticut in the US for its Venues division.
This asset has a book value in USD at the reporting date prior to any impairment that may be considered necessary of 23644k.
Given this licence is in perpetuity the book value of the asset is not amortised and the useful economic life allocated to the asset is indefinite.
Sportech Annual Report Pt6 Sportech Annual Report Pt6 Page 112 As required by IAS 36 an impairment test has been carried out as at 31 December 2017.
In testing for impairment other assets used solely to generate cash flows in the CGU are also included totalling 20158k 2016 14130k.
The recoverable amount of the asset has been determined based on a valueinuse calculation.
In calculating valuein use future opportunity value must be ignored.
Therefore although management consider there to be upside opportunity in its Venues division particularly in light of potential repeal of PASPA regulation to legalise sports betting and the appetite in the State of Connecticut to ensure this is taken advantage of locally the assumptions that are used in calculating valueinuse have been brought down since that performed in 2016.
This reflects the continuing underlying decline of core handle and other uncertainties.
Note that in previous reporting periods expected sale proceeds from surplus assets within the Venues division were included.
Those are now excluded given the lack of certainty of securing a sale of this asset in the shortterm despite the passage of time and the asset being marketed locally.
The key assumptions made were as follows EBITDA forecasts assume yearonyear handle decline in the core operating business of 2% and flat earnings on its core FandB venues excluding new venues and online compound annual handle growth for the online channel of 5% for Y15 compound annual handle growth at Bobby Vs venue in Stamford of 10% in Y23 and 5% in Y45 growth in FandB revenues in Stamford of 20% in Y2 and 15% in Y3 cash flows beyond the fifth year were extrapolated using a 2% rate of decline for the core business venues reflecting the industry handle rates 0% for food and beverage 2% growth in the online business and 2% growth for earnings from its new Bobby Vs venue in Stamford capital expenditure was included in the cash flows at managements best estimate of industry norm for reinvestment in retail outlets of the kind under review and a post tax discount rate of 9.1% 2016 9.1% was used representing a marketbased weighted average cost of capital appropriate for the Sportech Venues CGU.
This equates to a pre tax discount rate of 12.7% 2016 14.7%.
Following the impairment review the recoverable amount of those assets was deemed to be 27727k and accordingly an impairment of 16075k 12040k was charged to the income statement within administrative expenses 2016 1361k 1093k.
Management consider that the calculated recoverable amount is most sensitive to changes in the following reasonable downside assumptions.
Changes to the assumptions below all other variables held constant would cause further indicated impairments.
Resulting impairment Core business handle decline of 3% rather than 2% into perpetuity compound handle growth at Bobby Vs in Stamford of 5% rather than 10% FandB growth projections reduced by 50% each year 7470 Federal tax rate of 34% used as consistent to those in previous periods pre recent US tax reform 2798 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Sportech Annual Report Pt6 Sportech Annual Report Pt6 Page 113 Sportech PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements continued

Certain assets have been transferred into alternative sub categories within property plant and equipment following a detailed review of the asset registers.
This has no impact on the net position other than the items reclassified from intangible assets as stated in note 13 of the Annual Report.
Sportech Annual Report Pt6 Sportech Annual Report Pt6 Page 114 Impairment charges The Group has decided that it will not continue with its ventures in California and will exit this territory in 2018.
As a result assets capitalised which relate to its Californian ventures will generate no future economic benefit to the Group.
The Group owned certain items used to fit out its venue in San Diego and also incurred demolition and initial construction costs for a prospective new site at Norco in California.
Those items have been impaired in full to reflect that future profits will not be generated from their use.
The Group retained 80% control of the Norco site included within assets in the course of construction which have been impaired and so 20% of this write off 142k is therefore attributable to noncontrolling interests.
The items used in fitting out the sports bar in San Diego were 100% owned by the Group.

Impairments  SandS Venues The SandS Venues joint venture relates to one particular sports bar operated in San Diego California branded
Striders commenced trading in February 2016.
The venture has not been profitable and the Groups share of cumulative losses to 31 December 2017 were 513k.
Management reached a decision to exit from its interests in California with trade at Striders anticipated to cease in H118.
Accordingly the deemed future economic benefit to the Group from holding its investment in Striders is nil and the net investment has been impaired in full.

The Directors do not consider there will be sufficient future profits against which these losses can be offset due to the low profit generation in these particular business units.
The reduction in the deferred tax assets not recognised from unutilised trading losses is due predominantly to a disposal of losses within UK Lottery Management Limited during the year which previously formed part of the Groups Football Pools division.
Deferred tax assets are recognised on losses and foreign tax credits carried forward when it is probable that future taxable profits will be generated against which the losses and credits can be utilised.

Provisions for obsolescence held against inventories at 31 December 2017 amounted to 310k 2016 The provision for obsolete inventories has increased in the year as a result of spare parts which have not been utilised for a period of time.
Those spare parts must be held by the Group for terminals that are in use at customer sites.
Asset held for sale At 31 December 2017 the Board were of the view that the most probable route of realising future economic benefit through its Venues business in The Netherlands Sportech Racing BV and its subsidiaries was through a sale rather than continuing to operate it as part of the Sportech Group.
On 31 March 2018 the Group agreed to dispose of this business to RBP Luxembourg SA Ze Turf on a cash freedebtfree basis for initial consideration of 2.8m.
The deal was structured as a locked box mechanism with an effective date of 31 December 2017 and so the net cashdebt adjustments are known to the Group being an increase in the purchase price received of 233k.
Earn out consideration could also be earned by the Group of up to 450k contingent upon certain activities of this business being completed by 31 December 2018.
In accordance with IFRS 5 this business has been treated as an asset held for sale.
As at the balance sheet date the sale was deemed to be probable and the disposal of Sportech Racing BV will signal a departure from a major geographic location in which the Group previously operated.
Accordingly it has also been treated as a discontinued operation in these financial statements.

Other provisions include provisions for obligations to reinstate property to its original condition at the start of the lease term.
As disclosed in note 4 management have decided to exit from its interest in California.
In this territory the Group has a number of committed financial obligations which have become onerous contracts.
The amounts provided include committed costs at the leased sites in Norco and San Diego discounted at 2.5% totaling 1866k 1676k plus other onerous contract costs of 132k 98k and further obligations estimated at 1000k 740k.
The Norco lease ends in October 2023 and the San Diego lease ends in August 2024.
The
Group is a joint and severally liable guarantor for both leases with its JV partner.
In the absence of funding receipts from the Groups JV partner 100% of the future lease liability has been provided for.
As part of the Groups annual review of its provisions it was identified that certain provisions for onerous contracts and dilapidations were no longer required.
Those provisions totalling 261k did not arise during the period of Sportechs ownership.
Accordingly the gain from releasing those provisions have been shown within exceptional items rather than included in adjusted EBITDA.
The release of those provisions is noncash.
It was also identified that certain amounts held in other provisions were more reasonably classified as provisions for doubtful debts and have been reclassified as such therefore during the year with net nil impact to the income statement.
Financial liabilities 2017 2016 Deferred and contingent consideration due within one year recognised within Current liabilities 175 196 Noncurrent liabilities  82 Deferred and contingent consideration outstanding at the balance sheet date represents amounts due for the acquisition of Bump.

For employees in Ireland of which there are 15 the Group contributes between 7.5% and 12.5% of salary dependent on length of service into a defined contribution scheme.
For employees in France and Turkey of which there are one and seven respectively all pensions cover is provided through employer and employee social security contributions.
Defined benefit schemes In disposing of certain business assets with the Football Pools division in 2017 the defined benefit pension scheme was retained by Sportech.
The scheme was formed on 6 April 2001 and is governed by a Definitive Trust Deed and Rules.
It is a Registered Pension Scheme under Chapter 2 of Part 4 of the Finance Act 2004.
The scheme is contracted out of the State Second Pension Scheme and is not open to new members.
The assets of this scheme are held in an independent Trustee administered fund.
The US defined benefit scheme is administered by an insurance company in the US and provides retirement benefits to employees who are members of a collective bargaining unit represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
Benefits are based on value times credited service.

Both the pension schemes hold a low proportion of equities which reduces volatility and risk.
As the plans mature the Group intends to continue to reduce the level of investment risk by investing more in assets that better match the liabilities.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans bond holdings.
Inflation risks Some of the Groups pension obligations are linked to salary inflation and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
The majority of the plans assets are either unaffected by fixed interest bonds or loosely correlated with equities inflation meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
Life expectancy Most of the plans obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans liabilities.
Financial instruments Financial risk management policies and objectives The key financial risks borne by the Group and the policy of managing those risks are outlined below Liquidity risk The Group has been subject to a transformational period with the win on its Spot the Ball case and the disposal of its Football Pools division.
This has materially changed the liquidity risk that the Group is exposed to which was previously monitored with reference to covenants on borrowing facilities.
The Group has now cancelled its borrowing facilities and operates instead in a cash surplus position.
During the year the Group distributed its surplus cash back to shareholders in two tranches the first was a share buyback in March of 21.2m the second was a special dividend.
In quantifying the extent of those distributions the Board reviewed detailed cash flow forecasts which reviewed a period consistent with the Groups view on longterm strategy.
The forecasts included downside sensitivities thus providing material headroom from the Groups strategic plan to manage the Groups liquidity risk.
In managing shortterm divisional liquidity risks cash flow forecasting is performed on a weekly basis in the operating entities and is aggregated by Group finance.
This weekly forecasting recognises committed shortterm Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Sportech Annual Report Pt6 Sportech Annual Report Pt6 Page 125 Sportech PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements continued payables of the Group which are monitored and managed through regular discussions with suppliers.
Group
Finance monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups liquidity requirements to ensure each operating entity has sufficient cash to meet operational needs.
Cash surpluses are managed centrally by Group finance and cash swept uppushed down as cash surplusesrequirements arise.
Credit risk The Groups main exposure to credit risk is in accounts receivable in the Sportech Racing and Digital segment.
Credit risk in these entities is managed locally by assessing the creditworthiness of each new customer before agreeing payment and delivery terms.
Amounts held in cash for the Sportech Venues division are held in highly secure environments.
Foreign exchange risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures primarily with respect to the Euro and US Dollar.
Foreign exchange risk arises from transactions undertaken in foreign currencies the translation of foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities and from the translation into Sterling of the results and net assets of overseas operations.
The Group continually monitors the foreign currency risks and takes steps where practical to ensure that the net exposure is kept to an acceptable level.
In doing so the Group considers whether use of foreign exchange forward contracts would be appropriate in fixing the economic impact of forecasted profitability.
As at 31 December 2017 there were no outstanding commitments on foreign exchange forward contracts 2016 none.
During the year the Group did enter into a number of forward contracts for the settlement of US Dollars at contracted rates in order to hedge the earnings reported by the Group in its GBP denominated financial statements.
A net gain of 42k was recognised in respect of these forward contracts in 2017 2016 nil within operating costs.
With the disposal of the Groups primary UK business in the year the source of its revenues are now predominantly US Dollars.
A longterm strategy of managing its foreign exchange risk may involve a transition in its reporting currency from GBP to US Dollars.
This is under consideration by management and may result in a change in financial statement currency presentation in future periods.
The average rate for the US Dollar and Euro in both the current and previous reporting period are as outlined below.
2017 2016 Average Closing Average Closing US Dollars 1.30 1.35 1.34 1.23 If the exchange rates in 2017 were comparable to those in 2016 loss after tax would have been 25355k and the net assets would have been 55188k at 31 December 2017.
Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders benefits for other stakeholders and to achieve an efficient capital structure to minimise the cost of capital.
Sportech Annual Report Pt6 Sportech Annual Report Pt6 Page 126 Historically the Group monitored its capital risk based on its leverage ratio however with no debt there is a need to revise such a metric.
An appropriate metric in considering capital risk management and the ability of the Group to return cash to shareholders whilst operating within its means would be its implied liquidity per share defined as below 2017 2016 Implied liquidity per share 000 000 Current assets 32529 57988 Current liabilities 24442 49787 Net current assets 8087 8201 Noncurrent trade and other receivables 2443 2577 Noncurrent liabilities 3060 2281 Net position 7470 8497 less inventories held 2652 2504 Implied liquidity 4818 5993 Implied liquidity per share 2.6p 2.9p Management continue to monitor its implied liquidity per share in considering its most appropriate longterm strategy for either returns to shareholders or reinvestment in capital to drive further growth and potential returns.
Financial assets and liabilities At each reporting date the Group had the following categories of financial assets and liabilities 2017 2016 Loans and receivables 10309 13504 Available for sale financial assets 1546 2843 Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost 15945 28525 Available for sale financial assets 2017 2016 Noncurrent assets  Available for sale financial assets Contingent consideration receivable from disposal of SportechNYX Gaming LLC 1546 1582 Current assets  Available for sale financial assets Shares held in NYX Gaming Group Limited  1261 The Groups available for sale financial assets and hedging instruments are carried at fair value.
Alternative valuation methods used in applying the relevant fair values are summarised below level 1  quoted prices adjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 2  inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly that is as prices or indirectly that is derived from prices and level 3  inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data that is unobservable inputs.
Contingent consideration receivable from disposal of SportechNYX Gaming LLC In 2015 the Group disposed of its joint venture with NYX Gaming Group SportechNYX Gaming LLC for consideration which is partly contingent on future events.
The contingent consideration is C1.0m for each customer that NYX successfully sign up to its Real Money Live wagering platform before May 2020 up to a maximum of C3.0m.
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Sportech Annual Report Pt6 Sportech Annual Report Pt6 Page 127 Sportech PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements continued The fair value of contingent consideration is included in level 3.
Management observe market activity including industry growth and pace of regulatory change in determining the probability that the contingent consideration will be received.
It continues to be managements belief that NYX will sign up at least three new customers to the relevant platform and therefore the maximum amount of contingent consideration receivable has been recognised.
This has been discounted at 9% with interest unwinding on this discount within other finance charges.
The amount recognised as at 31 December 2017 is CAD 2618k 1546k within noncurrent trade and other receivables 2016 CAD 2460k 1582k.
Shares held in NYX Gaming Group Limited As part of the same 2015 disposal of SportechNYX Gaming LLC the Group also obtained shares in NYX Gaming Group Limited.
Under the terms of the disposal the Group was restricted from selling this investment for a period of at least twelve months post their initial receipt.
The fair value of shares held in NYX were included in level 1 prior to their disposal by the Group using the quoted share price at the reporting date in determining the amount receivable.
Fair value movements on those shares were recognised in the available for sale reserve within equity until the date of their disposal at which point cumulative gainslosses were recognised in the income statement.
On 25 September 2017 the Group sold its shares in NYX for net proceeds of 2333k.
At the point the shares were received the share price was CAD 4.06.
Those shares have been subsequently revalued as Available For Sale financial assets and losses realised when shares are disposed of.
The 2017 disposal reduces the Groups holding in NYX to nil and accordingly all unrealised losses to date of 1603k have been recognised in the income statement.
The share price on the date of disposal was CAD 2.35 Maturity of financial liabilities Nonderivative financial liabilities are all payable within twelve months.
In 2016 there were 82000 of financial liabilities that were payable within 12 years and all other financial liabilities were payable within twelve months.
Contingencies and commitments Capital commitments The Group had no contracts placed for capital expenditure that were not provided for in the financial statements at the current or prior year end dates.
Operating lease commitments The Group leases various offtrack betting venues and other operating sites under noncancellable operating lease arrangements.
The lease terms are generally between three and five years and are renewable at the end of the lease period at market rates.
The expenditure charged to the income statement was 4333k 2016 2809k.
This includes costs of providing for future operating lease payments in California as outlined in note 22 of 1676k.
The future aggregate minimum lease payments under noncancellable operating leases are as follows 2017 2016 No later than one year 1923 2646 Later than one year and no later than five years 6511 7730 Later than five years 7704 8499 Total 16138 18875 Other financial commitments The Group continues to provide a performance guarantee bond in Turkey equating to 15% of the contract value being 200k at 31 December 2017.
This is to facilitate provision of a customer service contract in the territory.
Sportech Annual Report Pt6 Sportech Annual Report Pt6 Page 128 Contingent items
The Groups activities in recent periods have resulted in material tax liabilities crystallising.
The ultimate tax liability due in all instances is subject to a degree of management judgment.
The judgments which are made are done so in good faith with the aim of always paying the correct amount of tax at the appropriate time.
Management work diligently with the Groups external financial advisors in quantifying the anticipated accurate and fair tax liability which arises from material oneoff events such as the Spot the Ball legal case and the disposal of the Football Pools.
Management have an open transparent and constructive relationship with tax regulators and engage positively when discussing any difference in legal interpretation between that of the Group and the regulators.
Certain contingent items exist at the reporting date with respect to tax liabilities as outlined below.
Corporation tax As disclosed in note 10 judgment has been applied by management as to the corporation tax which arises on the sale of the Football Pools.
Exposure to further liabilities as a result of differences to management judgment exist and a possible further tax liability could arise.
However this is deemed to be a possible rather than a probable liability and accordingly no provision has been made in the financial statements for this.
VAT
As disclosed in the 2015 interim financial statements HMRC have previously challenged the recovery of VAT by Sportech PLC as an active holding company providing wholly economic activities.
This challenge was aligned to European Case Law which ultimately ruled in the taxpayers favour.
HMRC have adjusted their challenge to Sportech in 2017 to instead focus on the value of the economic activities that Sportech PLC provides to its trading subsidiaries the majority of which are based overseas.
Assessments have been raised totalling 1.3m for the period to 31 December 2015 citing an undervaluation of the Groups management supplies which is made primarily to its exempt UK Football Pools business.
Should HMRC maintain this position then there will be further amounts assessed for 2016 and 2017 up to the date that the Group had no exempt UK business.
The Group has continued to engage its external advisors on this issue and has entered into a formal appeals process.
To continue with the appeal and in accordance with due process 1.3m has been paid to HMRC in 2018.
However management remain confident that this amount will be recovered given advice from its external tax and legal advisors and the likelihood of a material outflow being made to HMRC to settle this issue is considered remote.
No amounts have therefore been provided.
Other contingent items MandA activity Both the 2017 sale of the Football Pools division and the anticipated 2018 sale of the Groups Venues business in The Netherlands have customary seller warranties under the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreements.
Those warranties have been provided in good faith by management in light of the probability of certain events occurring.
The possibility of material claims being made under the seller warranties in either deal is considered by management to be remote.
Legal
The Group is engaged in certain disputes in the ordinary course of business which could potentially lead to outflows greater than those provided for on the balance sheet.
The maximum possible exposure considered to exist in view of advice received from the Groups professional advisors is up to 0.5m.
Management are of the view that the risk of those outflows arising is not probable and accordingly they are considered contingent items.

The tender offer price for the buyback was 1.015 and was fully subscribed resulting in payments to shareholders of 20933k.
Associated fees of this transaction were 259k.
Those shares were purchased and cancelled thus reducing the number of shares in issue to 185615244.
On 8 November 2017 the Company received Court approval for a 30p per share reduction in the nominal value of its share capital from 50p to 20p as approved by shareholders in May 2017.
This created distributable reserves of 55684000 and assisted in the Group making a further distribution of surplus cash in December 2017 by way of a special dividend of 29p per share.
Potential issue of ordinary shares The Performance Share Plan Certain Executive Directors and senior Executives have been awarded grants to acquire shares in the Company under the PSP subject to performance conditions.

Subsequent to this shareholders approved the setup of a new incentive plan for Directors and other members of the senior management team through a Value Creation Plan VCP the detail of which is provided later in this note.
For reporting purposes under IFRS as the new VCP was only available to management who had surrendered existing PSP awards from the 2017 grant this is treated as a beneficial modification of awards that have already been made by the Company.
Accordingly a valuation of the 2017 grant is required at the point in time that the VCP shares are issued.
The details of the assumption used in this valuation are provided within this note.
No awards issued under the 2017 PSP grant are outstanding at 31 December 2017.
Performance conditions The Remuneration Committee can set different performance conditions from those described below for future awards provided that in the reasonable opinion of the Committee the new targets are not materially less challenging in the circumstances than those described below.
The Committee determines the comparator group for each award.
The Remuneration Committee may also vary the performance conditions applying to existing awards if an event has occurred that causes the Committee to consider that it would be appropriate to amend the performance Sportech Annual Report Pt6 Sportech Annual Report Pt6 Page 130 conditions provided that the Committee considers the varied conditions are fair and reasonable and not materially less challenging than the original conditions would have been but for the event in question.
The awards are at nil cost to the employee.
Awards will normally vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant subject to the participants continued employment within the Group and the satisfaction of the performance conditions noted below 2016 grant The vesting of all of the award will be dependent on the Companys TSR over a fixed threeyear period commencing 3 March 2016 relative to that of the FTSE Small Cap index excluding investment trusts.
For the purpose of calculating TSR the base figure is averaged over the six weeks preceding the start of the performance period and the end figure is averaged over the last six weeks of the performance period.
Thereafter a vesting schedule no less demanding than the following will apply The Companys TSR performance over the performance period relative to comparator index Extent of vesting Equal to the index 25% Between equal to the index and upper quartile Pro rata between 25% and 100% Upper quartile or better 100% In addition to the primary performance condition the award is also subject to a financial underpin condition.
2015 grant The vesting of onehalf of the award Part A will be dependent on the Companys TSR over a fixed threeyear period beginning on the date of grant relative to that of the FTSE Small Cap Index excluding investment trusts.
For the purpose of calculating TSR the base figure is averaged over the six weeks preceding the start of the performance period and the end figure is averaged over the last six weeks of the performance period.
No portion of Part A will vest unless the Companys TSR performance at least matches that of the index.
Thereafter a vesting schedule no less demanding than the TSR condition on the 2016 grant as outlined above.
The vesting of the second half of the award is dependent on an EPS performance criterion Part B.
The average annual percentage growth in the Companys EPS in excess of the RPI over the EPS performance period must at least equal 4%.
Vesting is determined by the following schedule The Companys average annual growth in EPS in excess of RPI during the performance period Extent of vesting of Part B Less than 4% per annum 0% 4% per annum 25% Between 4% and 10% per annum Pro rata between 25% and 100% 10% or better 100% Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Sportech Annual Report Pt6 Sportech Annual Report Pt6 Page 131 Sportech PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements continued All PSP grants Awards are valued using a Stochastic Monte Carlo valuation model.

It is this valuation that triggers the financial statement impact of the awards in issue.
The weighted average remaining contractual life of outstanding awards under the PSP at 31 December 2017 was one year 2016 one year and six months.
The weighted average exercise price of awards granted during the period was nil 2016 nil.
PSP awards are not affected by the riskfree rate input since no payment is required by the recipient and therefore no interest could be earned elsewhere.
The expected volatility is based on movements in the historical return index share price with dividends reinvested for the three years prior to the award date.
The dividend yield does not affect the fair value of the award as the rules of the PSP entitle a participant to receive cash equal in value to the dividends that would have been paid on the vested shares in respect of dividends paid during the vesting period and is therefore assumed to be 0%.
See notes 4 and 5 for the total expense recognised in the income statement for share options granted and PSP awards made to Directors and employees respectively Value Creation Plan On 24 May 2017 shareholders approved the creation of a new executive management incentive plan known as the Value Creation Plan VCP.
Participants in the VCP were granted an Award giving them a future right to earn ordinary shares in the Company based on the cumulative total shareholder return generated over the VCP performance period.
The VCP provides participants with a pool of ordinary shares with a value equal to 20% of any cumulative shareholder value created above a compound hurdle rate of 8% per annum.
However in the event of a change of control that results in accelerated vesting in 2017 or 2018 or in the case of an Executive Director being deemed a Good Leaver as defined in the VCP rules in 2017 or 2018 the compound hurdle rates for vesting will be 12% and 10% respectively.

Pools Holland Total Revenue 28342 5404 33746 Cost of sales 4825 4727 9552 Gross profit 23517 677 24194 Marketing and distribution costs 12  12 Operating costs 56488 653 57141 Operating profit 32983 24 32959 Other items Lossprofit before tax 32983 24 32959 Lossprofit for the year 33653 24 33629 Exceptional items Certain restructuring and redundancy costs in respect of business modernization had been included in 2016 within cost of sales.
On closer inspection those costs were in respect of employees whose staff costs have been deemed to be an operating cost of the business as opposed to a cost of sale see note 30d.
Depreciation and amortisation In previous years depreciation and amortisation on assets which were being utilised on racetracks or of property plant and equipment in the venues business were being presented within cost of sales.
It is managements belief that those costs are of a fixed nature albeit may vary over time with material capital investment such as the new Bobby Vs in Stamford.
However the charge does not vary directly with revenues and so they have been reclassified to operating costs.
The depreciation charge relating to assets which are employed at customer racetracks in the year was 604k 2016 492k.
Staff costs The costs of individuals working on customer racetracks or within the operating Venues were previously held within cost of sales.
As those costs are fixed in nature they have been reclassified to operating costs.
The cost of the comparative staff costs included within operating costs this year are 10884k in Racing and Digital 2016 10121k and 5741k in Venues 2016 4694k.
Marketing costs Marketing costs had historically been deemed to be a fixed operating cost of the business however investment in marketing would be expected to correlate with changes in revenue and so they have been presented as separately identified marketing and distribution costs on the face of the income statement.
Other costs Other costs which were previously deemed to be cost of sales but are now considered by management to be of a fixed operating cost nature have been reclassified including property costs in Venues of 4.2m travel and entertainment for employees working at customer racetracks in Racing and Digital of 0.5m IT and telecommunications charges and certain marketing and promotional expenditure within the Venues division.
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Sportech Annual Report Pt6 Sportech Annual Report Pt6 Page 135 Sportech PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements continued Post balance sheet events Disposal of Venues business in The Netherlands As disclosed in note 19 the Group signed an SPA with RBA Luxembourg SA on 31 March 2018 to dispose of its Dutch Venues business in The Netherlands for initial consideration of 2.8m net of cash and debt adjustments.
Additional contingent consideration of up to 450k could be due to the Group subject to this business completing certain activities by 31 December 2017.
Disposal costs associated with the transaction are anticipated to be approximately 200k.
As disclosed in note 10 it is anticipated that a net gain on disposal will arise from the transaction of approximately 0.9m.
The deal is subject to certain regulatory approvals which are anticipated to be provided no later than 30 June 2018.
The deal has been structured as a locked box with an effective date of 1 January 2018.
Accordingly all 2018 profits of the business other than commercially agreed amounts payable for Sportechs ongoing management of the business until completion will accrue to the purchaser.
