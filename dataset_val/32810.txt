OUR KEY OUTPUTS
Strong brand and reputation Leading infrastructure and support service business First class customer service Shareholder returns Asset management and realise value Building a sustainable business Extended Outlook How much have we returned to shareholders The Groups dividend history speaks for itself as do its longstanding relationships with supportive institutional investors.
The Group remains committed to delivering compelling value to shareholders as demonstrated by the recent doubling of the annual dividend payout.
What is the Group worth Stobart Group is listed on the London Stock Exchange and based on the share price of 222.75p on 5 May 2017 has a market capitalisation of 789.3m.
Considering the Groups proven history of value creation realisation and returns to shareholders coupled with the promise of future stable longterm and predictable increased cash and profit generation as the Energy and Aviation divisions mature it is easy to see how the market would ascribe this valuation and higher valuations to the Group in the future.
What to look forward to in the Groups next chapter Following the substantial realisation of our investment in Eddie Stobart Logistics subsequent to the year end and having taken full ownership of our airline and aircraft leasing businesses during the year the Group is entering an exciting new era.
We are in control of our own destiny and whilst rightly proud of our logistics heritage we look forward to taking our Energy Aviation and Rail divisions to the next level delivering further returns for shareholders.

CHAIRMANS STATEMENT
Success and succession We have made further solid progress across all our divisions at Stobart Group this year including taking full ownership of our airline Stobart Air and aircraft leasing business Propius and increasing the number of routes from London Southend
Our key biomass processing sites are up and running and we continue to realise outstanding value from the property and investment portfolios.
We remain confident we can achieve our published objectives for each division.
Strategy and Delivery Our Groups strategy for our five divisions is well established and good progress has been made during the year.
Please refer to the Strategic Framework on pages 23 and the Operational Review on pages 1426 to read about our strategy and progress.
T o take one example our Eddie Stobart Logistics investment of which we now own 12.5% has yielded a great return with the promise of further returns to come.
The recent IPO realised cash for the Group of 113.3m from the sale of 36.5% of the Groups original 49% investment.
The company known as Eddie Stobart Logistics plc has announced the intention to pay a 2017 dividend and implement a progressive dividend policy.
The decision to hold 49% after the 2014 realisation has proved to be a good one and we anticipate our remaining 12.5% investment worth 71.5m at the date of the IPO will continue to grow in value.
Board Stability and Succession We have had a very stable Board in recent years with no changes to the NonExecutive Directors since the current members were appointed in 2013 and 2014.
Andrew Tinkler founded Stobart Group and has been the CEO since its flotation in 2007.
During this time he has been an entrepreneurial driving force initially transforming the fortunes of the Eddie Stobart business and then setting the strategy of the Group today which includes the fastgrowing Energy and Aviation businesses.
He has also overseen the value improvement and realisation of the Groups property portfolio delivering consistent returns to shareholders.
In December 2016 we announced that Warwick Brady would be joining the Group as Deputy Group CEO having previously been COO of easyJet plc.
Warwicks recruitment provided the Group with further aviation expertise and broader management capability.
Also earlier in July 2016 we announced that Ben Whawell was to step down from the Board and become the CEO GOOD GOVERNANCE Allied to entrepreneurial flair strong governance is critical for success at Stobart.
I am pleased that the Board has been stable and fully compliant with the UK Corporate Governance Code over the last financial year.
Board and governance achievements in the last 18 months Set out strategy following the partial disposal of the Transport and Distribution business.
Held full strategy review meetings with the divisional management in September 2016.
Completed Board evaluation and set an action plan.

REPORT GOVERNANCE
STATEMENTS of Stobarts Energy division providing strong experienced and dedicated leadership at a very important phase of its development.
These appointments meant that the Group has strong leadership in place in key positions and allowed the Board to further develop plans for succession and long term value creation.
We are pleased to announce that Warwick will join the Board and be appointed as the Groups CEO following Junes AGM.
Andrew will continue as an Executive Board member giving the Board continued access to his input at Group level.
He will also Chair a newly formed independent business Stobart Capital which will be at the heart of the Groups new value creation unit see below.
On behalf of the Board I would like to thank Andrew for his unique and tireless contribution to the Board and to the Group over the past ten years and I look forward to working with Andrew and Warwick in their new roles.
Richard Butcher Executive Director and CEO of Stobart Infrastructure will not offer himself for reelection and will step down from the Board at the AGM.
Richards role has evolved as the number of properties remaining in the Group portfolio has reduced.
He will continue to manage the portfolio and implement the Groups realisation strategy in his role as CEO of Stobart Infrastructure.
I would like to thank Richard for his valued contribution to the Group over many years.
Mark Adams was appointed as interim CFO in November 2016 and has assisted the Group through the extension of the bank facility the acquisitions of the airline and Propius and the sale and leaseback of the Propius aircraft post year end.
With these transactions now complete Mark will step down from his position at 31 May 2017 and I would like to take this opportunity to thank him for his contribution to the Group.
We will make a further announcement regarding the leadership of the finance function in due course.
Stobart Capital Stobart Group has a strong track record of entrepreneurialism growth and investment.
The Group has decided to formally bring this expertise together within a new dedicated value creation unit to be headed by Andrew Tinkler and supported by Ian Soanes a longstanding advisor to the Group.
This will enable the management teams of the Groups core Energy Aviation Rail and Infrastructure operations to focus on driving the value of their existing businesses.
Stobart Capital will operate independently of the Group with access to external capital and expertise but working closely with the Groups management team.
Investment opportunities will be presented to a new Value Creation Board a subcommittee of the Stobart Group Board for evaluation.
Comprehensive review of risks.
Appointed financial internal auditors who have started their programme of work.
Proposed a revised Remuneration P olicy for approval at the AGM.
Results for the Year I am pleased to report another year delivering growth in both revenue and underlying EBITDA in spite of challenges due to delays in the expected operational date of biomass plants in the Energy division and slow progress in delivering capacity growth at London Southend Airport impacted by a brief hiatus following the Brexit vote.
After a net noncash goodwill writeoff of 21.6m and other nonunderlying costs of 13.8m there was a loss before tax for the year of 8.0m.
Compounding Returns to
During the year to 28 February 2017 34.7m was returned to shareholders through dividends.
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 4.5p 2016 4.0p per ordinary share totalling 15.9m 2016 13.8m paid on 8 July and giving an increased total dividend payable for the year of 13.5p 2016 6.0p comprising of three interim dividends of 3.0p and a final dividend of 4.5p.
We expect to maintain the quarterly dividend at this increased level.
We will continue to support the funding of the dividend from proceeds of property asset disposals and investment realisations in the shortterm and the Board will consider additional returns to shareholders should there be surplus funds generated.
As the Board and I look forward to the next 12 months I am confident that Stobarts strengths will continue to prevail as we all work together to achieve our clear objectives.

Stobart Group Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2017 CHIEF EXECUTIVES STATEMENT Driving the value I have been CEO of Stobart Group for almost 10 years and during that time we have generated a compound shareholder return of around 10% p.
We have also developed Energy and Aviation platforms to deliver our targets to 2018 and beyond.
The Group is now uniquely placed as an entrepreneurial public limited company that creates value supported by its strong heritage in logistics and systems and with a real focus on delivering great customer service.
With a market capitalisation of close to 800m a strong balance sheet and a progressive dividend policy the Group is well placed to continue to deliver strong returns to shareholders for the foreseeable future.
Highlights and History of Stobart Group 2004 Purchased Eddie Stobart Limited for 2m  previously losing 10m per annum in 2003.
2007 Stobart Group Limited listed on the London Stock Exchange through a 138m reverse takeover of Westbury Property Fund creating a leading road transport and rail business.
2008 Created a platform for a multimodal logistics business.
2009 Invested in London Southend Airport with its 45 minute rail link to
2010 Purchased initial 50% of Stobart Energy subsequently increased to 100% that has now become the leading supplier of biomass in the UK.
2012 Invested in Stobart Air a Dublinbased regional airline that now operates under the Aer Lingus brand and an aircraft leasing business.
2012 Purchase of Moneypenny property portfolio which subsequently delivered a 22.5% IRR.
2012 Autologic acquired for 12m and since realised 6x money multiple.
2014 Reconstituted the Stobart Group Board under the chairmanship of Iain Ferguson CBE ex Unilever and CEO of T ate and Lyle plc.
2014 Sale of 51% of Eddie Stobart Logistics ESL when the Group had a market capitalisation c.
475m realising 196m of cash to reduce debt levels and strengthen the balance sheet.
2017 ESL floated on AIM with a market capitalisation of 573m delivering a return of 4.2x since the sale of 51% in 2014 creating significant value for shareholders.
ESL being transformed from a road transport to a logistics and distribution business operating across a broad range of sectors underpinned by blue chip customers.
Where are we today Stobart Group now comprises three core operating divisions in sectors with real growth opportunities.
Our Energy Aviation and Rail civil engineering businesses are all well placed for profitable growth over the next five years.
Our Infrastructure and Investments divisions continue their programme of divestment creating further value for shareholders.
Energy  this year has been about establishing the foundations of infrastructure logistics and people to ensure our ability to deliver on our longterm fuel supply contracts into over 20 biomass plants around the UK.
Widnes and Tilbury storage processing sites are now up and running and those plants are progressing towards commissioning.
Development of other processing sites at Port Clarence and Rotherham is also underway.
A full management team is now in place focused on professionalising the industry to deliver longterm sustainable supply and management of predominantly recycled wood under longterm indexlinked contracts.
Aviation  a significant year for the Aviation division with continued development of our airport London Southend which we believe will play a key part in providing capacity for the constrained London air travel market.
A London airport that has technical capacity to handle 10m passengers 45 minutes from London will over time be a very valuable asset for the Group.
We have consolidated our regional airline and aircraft leasing businesses taking full ownership and will continue to develop our valuable longterm franchise with Aer Lingus as well as support Flybe in the Isle of Man and from our London Southend Airport.

Rail and NonRail Civil Engineering our Rail business continues to support speciality work for Network Rail as well as being a tier 2 supplier to the industry.
We expect to see continued growth under the Stobart brand.
The nonrail business has also supported infrastructure projects in our Energy and Aviation divisions by providing an efficient lowcost value engineering construction solution.
Infrastructure  our plan to divest non core infrastructure assets continues and we have delivered against our plan this year.
The business is also very good at providing asset management initiatives working alongside our Rail division and delivering ontime and to budget.
Investments  the post yearend IPO of Eddie Stobart Logistics plc valued the Groups 49% investment at 184.8m significantly ahead of the yearend carrying value of 58.4m and realised cash of 113.3m.
This is a great example of how we have created significant value for the Group and our shareholders.
People
One of my personal business beliefs is to employ people that are better than yourself and I see this as a strength from a shareholder perspective as well as CEO.
Working together with our new Group CEO Warwick Brady whom I have known for several years and worked closely alongside for the last six months I believe that we can bring extensive value to the
I am strongly of the view that Warwicks industrywide knowledge and experience will help grow and support the entire Group.
I am confident that his business experience and entrepreneurial approach will be a key part in the next chapter of Stobart Groups value creation.
Energy  headed by Ben Whawell CEO Stobart Energy and the exGroup CFO.
We have worked together for the last 17 years and I am confident that he has the skills and experience to move the Energy business to the next level and create significant shareholder value.
Aviation  this division includes airports a regional airline and an aircraft leasing company.
These businesses all have potential and are supported by our proven logistics expertise.
The teams within this division led by Glyn Jones will support Warwick in delivery of our objectives.
Rail  Managing Director Kirk T aylor of our Rail and nonrail civil engineering business has worked with me since 1994.
He is diligent and passionate about our business and can grow Rail to be the number one specialist provider to the rail and construction industry as well as supporting the Group in any valueadding infrastructure projects.
Whilst I am handing over the reins to lead and run Stobart Group to Warwick Ben Glyn and Kirk as the third largest shareholder I believe that we are now on the next stage of our journey that will realise the significant potential of the Group over the coming years.
As a key founder of Stobart Group I am committed to remaining on the Board for the foreseeable future and to supporting Warwicks transition to Group CEO. of further significant shareholder value.
The remainder of my time will be spent working with Richard Butcher to deliver value in our Infrastructure and Investments divisions and in particular in launching and developing Stobart Capital bringing together the Groups investment activities under a new value creation unit.
This will be a platform working alongside external professionals and exploiting my entrepreneurial skills and experience to bring investment opportunities to the Group that complement the strategy and have the potential to create further returns for shareholders.
I would like to thank Richard for his valued contribution to the business over many years and also thank Mark for his work as interim CFO over recent months.

Stobart Value Wheel  28 February 2017 Stobart Value Wheel  Proforma Stobart Group Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2017 DEPUTY CHIEF EXECUTIVES STATEMENT I am delighted to join Stobart Group at an exciting time when the foundations in Energy Aviation and Rail are ripe for further development and growth.
I have worked with the Group since 2009 during the early stages of developing London Southend Airport when I was Chief Operating Officer at easyJet.
My experience working with this entrepreneurial team gave me insights into the value being created.
This sparked my interest and led me to follow the Groups progress over recent years.
Over the years I have forged a good working relationship with Andrew Tinkler and once I left easyJet in September 2016 I spent three months working very closely with Andrew and the Stobart Group Board to understand the value of the Group but moreover to see if I could use my international experience from my early days in Private Equity through to my extensive aviation experience in Europe to support and lead the next chapter for the Stobart Group.
I am particularly impressed by how the Group applies its heritage in logistics and distribution across all the divisions as well as how it embraces the customer service ethos.
When combined with being very entrepreneurial culturally the Group fits with my ambitions.
I expect to use the foundations in Energy Aviation and Rail to continue creating value for shareholders over the longterm.
Over the last six months I have very much enjoyed working with the Board and Andrew but moreover believe there is a lot of unlocked value and growth potential across our core divisions that has yet to be realised.
Whilst the foundations have been laid in each division with investment and a clear strategic direction the business can continue to grow.
The Group has all the resources available to support accelerated growth and then over time the operating businesses will underpin the value creation for our shareholders.
Energy
Having now toured several of the Groups processing sites and plants as well as spending time working with Ben and the team I can see that this business is all about logistics and distribution so fits very well with the core expertise of the Group.
With several of the large energy plants coming on stream over the next 12 months there will inevitably be a few challenges but I am confident that the team will deliver on the overall targets.
I expect we will deliver 60% of the markets fuel supply into biomass plants and this will underpin the financial returns for the next 20 years or so.
I also see opportunities to grow the business through operating and managing the energy plants and extending into other forms of fuel that can leverage our current specialist transport and logistics operation.
Aviation
Airport  The key to value creation is our London airport becoming part of the answer to supporting Londons travel growth within the airport systems.
The ongoing London airport capacity constraints will mean our London airport with its great train links 45 minutes from London will be an opportunity for the capitals travel market to grow.
London Southend Airport is Londons best airport and the infrastructure can support 10m passengers per year.
The other differentiator is that Stobart Group provides all the services across the airport from operating the railway station owning and operating our 4 hotel under the Holiday Inn brand our food and beverage outlets car parking and solar farm.
These all create additional value for the Group and will be an important part of further developing Londons best airport.
There is also a lot of space to develop our property assets at the airport which could be used for maintenance and other businesses.
It is truly remarkable that we will be able to create a London airport capable of delivering 10m passengers per year for under 200m so the capital efficiency is impressive.
Airline and Aircraft Leasing  Our regional airline Stobart Air based in Dublin operates under a longterm franchise with Aer Lingus which we believe will be an important support for International Airlines Groups focus on growing its transatlantic traffic through the Dublin hub.
Stobart Air also operates for Flybe and in the future will operate regional jets under the Flybe brand to support the growth of our London airport.
Our
From my perspective the UK and Europes regional airline market would benefit from some type of consolidation to ensure the capacity supports profitable regional connectivity.

Ground Handling and Support Services The Group already provides ground handling services and given its expertise in logistics distribution and customer services we plan to grow this business in the UK and Europe.
Stobart Exec Jet Centre  With c.100000 private jet movements into the London market per year our Exec Jet Centre is well placed to offer a great service by connecting product into London.
With a clear plan to grow this business we believe over time it will become a key part of Londons executive aviation offering.
The Group is well setup for growing these small but established businesses and capitalising on the current opportunities in the market.
Rail and NonRail Civil
Our Stobart Rail team is highly regarded in the Industry and provides valuable tier 2 specialist services to Network Rail and its tier 1 partners.
Its real competitive advantage is the teams innovative approach to developing equipment systems and people to deliver significant value to the customer.
Stobart Rail is renowned for operating strongly under critical time constraints and delivering quality work on time and to budget.
On the nonrail side the team are specialists in building distribution centres airports racecourses etc.
T ogether with an innovative approach design capability planning and low cost execution they provide value engineering across the
They have supported the Group by building processing sites for Stobart Energy as well as providing specialist infrastructure projects at the airport including taxiways runway works etc.
This provides the Group with a real competitive advantage by being able to deliver infrastructure at competitive costs.
Overall after a lot of due diligence and time spent within Stobart Group I see an opportunity to use the foundations to grow the Group over the next few years.
We will aim to remain a very entrepreneurial team with Andrew Tinkler supporting as an Executive Director to ensure we do not lose our founders mentality of creating value and operating in an agile way.
This will ensure that we continue to grow the business to deliver sustainable and progressive returns for shareholders for years to come.

Stobart Group Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2017 MEDIUMTERM PLAN Target biomass supply of over 2mt p. by calendar year 2018.
Sustain EBITDA of over 10 per tonne by calendar year 2018.
Develop processing sites to process around 50% of the total volume required under Stobart Energy contracts.
PROGRESS WITH THE PLAN Solid progress made on the implementation of the processing site plan Widnes and Tilbury sites constructed and commenced operations.
Rotherham site purchased and construction commenced in March 2017.
Preferred Teesside site identified and in feasibility stage.
Significant upfront investment in headcount and infrastructure to be able to deliver on our longterm contractual obligations.
Restructure of our transport fleet in line with the future requirements of the business.
Development of relationships with renewable energy plant operators and owners.
Strategic reduction in export volumes and a large plant going into administration resulted in reduced volumes during the year.
Future growth opportunities in waste supply and logistics identified.
OPERATIONAL REVIEW STOBART ENERGY Putting the foundations in place for future growth Mission Statement To keep the lights on by supplying the right quality biomass on time and at the best possible margin.
Stobart Energy is the number one supplier of biomass in the UK sourcing and supplying fuel to renewable energy plants under a mix of short and longterm contracts.
What has been the key objective for the business over the last 12 months The success of this division is based on our ability to source process and deliver the right quality of fuel when our customers require it.
Having already secured contracts to supply over 2.0mt p. year 2018.
During the year we had to manage the loss of volume when a UK renewable energy plant went into administration.
In addition we commenced the strategic reduction of export volumes in readiness for new UK plants.
These impacted on both tonnes supplied and revenue however the impact on EBITDA was mitigated by tight cost control.
How has the business invested in its infrastructure We have made significant progress during the year building the infrastructure required to achieve our longterm plan.
T o ensure a secure sustainable supply chain we increased the size of our procurement team and focused on building longterm contractual relationships with suppliers of unprocessed wood including European suppliers.
We commenced operations at the Widnes and Tilbury wood processing sites investing in the latest wood processing equipment and ensured we have adequate space to store unprocessed wood to mitigate against seasonal imbalances in supply and demand.

10.8% E V E N U E M 7.8% NDE R L Y I NG E BI T D A 7% NDE R L Y I NG E BI T D A PER TONNE 26.4% IVISIONAL KPIs financial year Stobart Group purchased a site in Rotherham which will be developed into a wood processing site and we are currently evaluating a further site at T eesside.
We are on course to process around 50% of the total volume required by our customers.
We recognised the importance of building and maintaining effective working relationships with our customers given the length and financial value of the contracts in place.
As a result we established a contract management team which is responsible for these relationships on a daytoday basis and ensures that we are meeting our contractual obligations.
Finally we have expanded our quality control team and invested in the latest testing equipment to ensure that the processed product we supply meets the contractual specification and that we can audit our supply chain from start to finish.
What are the key challenges facing the business Given the infrastructure of supply chain wood processing sites transport network contract management and quality control that are required to service these sizable contracts a change to the timing of when a key biomass plant becomes fully operational presents a significant challenge to our business.
We incurred significant and excess costs at our Widnes processing site based on a delay of two months in the renewable energy plant requiring fuel.
Furthermore once burning fuel the plant experienced a number of operational issues which meant the Widnes processing site was not operating at the expected levels for commissioning.
These excess costs and other contract setup costs totalling 3.0m of which 1.0m relates to prior years have been disclosed as nonunderlying.
Though we recognise these movements represent key challenges in the interim we do not expect these delays to impact on our stated goals of supplying 2m tonnes and 10 EBITDA per tonne by the end of calendar year 2018.
At the start of the year we also reduced the size of our transport fleet by 10% in light of network changes.
At this point we decided against further reducing the size of the fleet due to the future demand from new contracts.
As a result the business carried significant excess costs of underutilised trucks during the current financial year which have been included in nonunderlying costs.
Finally the extent of regulatory requirements in relation to transporting waste product and operating wood processing sites represents a significant challenge to our business as well as the industry as a whole.
We have mitigated this through the strength of our processes and procedures and by maintaining regular and effective communication with regulatory bodies.
Our focus over the next 12 months will be to ensure that we minimise the risk of incurring unnecessary costs whilst ensuring we are ready to service renewable energy plants as and when they come online.
What are the key drivers for growth Growth will be driven by leveraging our position in the market to source unprocessed wood at the most competitive rate by maximising operational efficiency within our transport network and at our wood processing sites and by ensuring that we produce the best possible specification biomass product for our customers.
A further key driver of growth will be to utilise our existing infrastructure to increase our involvement in other waste fuel such as Refuse Derived Fuel and Solid Recovered Fuel.

Stobart Group Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2017 SUPPLY CHAIN SPECIFIC TO TILBURY Created a secure sustainable supply chain capable of providing waste wood volumes to meet contractual biomass fuel volumes.
Seasonal changes in supply and demand mitigated by longterm contracts with waste wood suppliers and a dedicated waste wood procurement team for the plant.
TRANSPORT
Aveley and Sittingbourne operations were relocated to Tilbury in order to collect waste wood from the London area and deliver into the plant.
Provision to park up to 50 vehicles on site.
OPERATIONS
Due to a delay caused by failure of the renewable energy plant to hand over the processing site on time we invested at additional cost in a shortterm mobile processing facility for the Fort Road site whilst a fixed processing facility at the renewable energy plant is being built expected completion July 2017.
Once the plant is completed Fort Road will become a storage site holding waste wood to ensure sufficient supply to meet plant demand.

Develop and grow our private executive jet centre to become Londons best airport for private aviation customer service.
Grow EBITDA to 8 per passenger in 2018.
Establish Carlisle Lake District Airport for commercial operations.
Continue to deliver the best customer service in the market.
Strengthen relationship with Aer Lingus Stobart Airs key franchise partner.
PROGRESS WITH THE PLAN London Southend Airport LSA offers a unique combination of peak airport capacity in a very constrained London airport system easy access efficient operations driving a lowcost base and an exceptional customer experience.
The combination of these factors is attractive to both airlines and passengers.
We are therefore optimistic that growth at LSA will come from regional lowcost and fullservice operators especially from the UK particularly London but with strong support from inbound passengers coming from mainland Europe.
LSA was once again recognised by the Airport Operators Association as the best airport in Britain in 2016 for its category having also won the title in 2015.
The task of raising awareness of the benefits of LSA is well understood and marketing plans developed in 2016 are already in deployment with significantly heavier weight than in previous years.
The acquisition of additional capacity with Flybe combined with easyJet growth announced in 2016 will take LSAs passenger numbers during 201718 to
Brexit vote.
Thus we remain confident in our expectation of reaching 2.5m passengers by the end of calendar year 2018.
In addition to the above Carlisle Lake District Airport CLDA has received confirmation of funding from Cumbria Local Enterprise Partnership for development in 201718 and planning for the development of the airport is at an advanced stage.

As well as LSA and CLDA the Aviation division also includes full ownership of our regional airline Stobart Air operating under the Aer Lingus and Flybe brands as well as our aircraft leasing business Propius Holdings Limited.
How do we leverage our assets to support the growth of LSA and the division to maximise value for shareholders Regional Airline  Stobart Air Stobart Air SA is an important part of the Stobart Aviation division.
It is a respected regional airline currently operating under both the Aer Lingus and Flybe brands with 17 modern ATR aircraft carrying c.2m customers per annum.
The valuable franchise with Aer Lingus within International Airline Group IAG provides highquality competitive punctual and responsive scheduled services delivering a third of the pointtopoint traffic between the UK and Ireland.
The airline provides integral support to the transatlantic growth of IAG through its provision of feeding traffic into the Dublin Hub which has seen considerable growth in recent years.
In addition SA operates a successful wet lease operation for Flybe in the Isle of Man with two dedicated ATR aircraft.
In summary Stobart Air is a wellrun competitive regional airline that has the capacity to operate more franchise agreements as part of creating additional value for the Group.
Stobart Aviation also plans to use Stobart Air to directly support activities at London Southend Airport delivering up to 300000 additional passengers through the airport by 2018.
Leasing Business  Propius During the year Stobart Group acquired all the interests in Propius previously onethird was owned by each of Stobart Group Invesco Perpetual and Aer Lingus.
The ownership forms part of our plan to release the value of the airline and to fund the purchase of eight new aircraft.

Furthermore staying abreast of legislative change and compliance requires a strong team sometimes bringing associated costs.
We understand the value in keeping the right management teams in place to ensure Stobart Rails ability In calendar year 2017 we hope to increase our win percentage on bids securing more contracts with Network Rail and other tier 1 providers whilst maintaining good working relationships with our clients at all levels of the business.
Furthermore we have increased our focus on our customers aspirational growth plans which allows us to provide them with better support.
While we will not waiver from our growth target of a minimum 5% per year Stobart Rail recognises the need for flexibility and looks to remain open to new areas of service provision.
Kirk Taylor Managing Director Stobart Rail to plan competently deliver successful projects and ensure quality throughout.
We will strive to form partnerships with likeminded contractors enabling us to build a complementary and efficient alliance that fulfils the requirement of these partnerships.
What are your targets for 2017 We aim to deliver efficiencies across all our contracts both external and internal.
On the numerous projects for Stobart Energy and Stobart Aviation this year our target is to complete all planned works efficiently and safely without compromising on the quality of the end product and without adversely affecting live operations.
We hope to take advantage of current successes such as the Far North Contract and increase our railway maintenance associated business.

UNDERLYING EBITDA 8 1 .0% ISPOSAL PROFITS AND REVALUATION GAINS 1 00.0% ET CASH GENERATED FROM PROPERTY DISPOSALS 6 1 2.2% IVISIONAL KPIS The disposal of the Speke property in particular is a fantastic demonstration of the division managing assets to deliver their full potential.
The 53acre property of which 47 acres were occupied by Ford was acquired in December 2015 and in March 2016 negotiations were concluded with Ford for a new 20year lease at an annual rent of 2.1m and an option for the tenant to acquire the site for 37.0m which was ultimately exercised on 31 May 2016.
As a result of the disposal the Group has realised a total gain of 20.7m since acquiring the property and it still retains ownership of six acres of development land.
We are currently pursuing a number of potential development options for this land which is expected to result in further value creation for the Group.
Speke
Hull
In November 2016 we completed the sales of our BandQ premises in Kingston uponHull and land at Knutsford Road Chelford generating combined net cash proceeds of 15.8m.
The BandQ store was sold to a third party following a successful negotiation with BandQ for a tenyear lease extension.
The Chelford site for which the division had secured outline planning consent for a residential development was sold to one of the UKs leading home builders.
These two disposals generated a profit of 2.8m during the year and are further great examples of the Infrastructure team managing and developing our assets to enhance value.
Also of note is the divisions successful assignment of a lease on a warehouse at Daventry achieving a profit of 1.0m on the lease assignment as well as removing exposure to a potential liability on the headlease of 9.8m.
Revaluation gains in the year amounted to 3.1m reflecting our continued success in asset management to achieve greater returns for Stobart Group.

Overview of risk identification and management The successful management of risk is a fundamental part of Stobart Groups activities and is critical to the delivery of our business plan.
Strategy
Our formal approach to risk management is delivered through the application of the Stobart Group Risk Management
The Framework is a defined process for identifying and escalating significant risks.
It applies to the whole Group with the responsibility for oversight of the process resting with the Audit Committee.
Consideration of our appetite for and tolerance of risk forms part of the risk management process in particular when deciding how best to manage the risks that are identified.
Having a robust system of internal control with a combination of people process and technology controls helps us to mitigate risk.
Inherent Attributes of Stobart Group Stobart Group is strongly process driven.
A stable longstanding management team is in place.
Operations are predominantly in the UK with a welldeveloped business culture.
Stobart Group promotes a Just Culture which encourages open and fair reporting enabling clear lines of communication throughout the business.

Risk Appetite The level of risk considered appropriate to achieving our business objectives is determined by the Board.
The Group has no appetite for risk relating to the health safety and welfare of employees customers and the wider community.
We do have an increasing appetite for risk in relation to activities which are directed towards creating additional demand for our services to drive revenues and increase financial returns for the Group.

Economic Outlook Following the UKs referendum vote to leave the membership of the EU management continues to monitor the implications for the Group.
The Group and its customers are predominantly UK based and though there have been some effects on US dollar denominated costs in the airline this has been partly offset by the US dollar denominated assets in the leasing company.
The
Group benefits from diverse assets and sources of income and its entrepreneurial culture leaves it well placed to respond to future developments and opportunities.

STATEMENTS
Performance in the Year This year we have continued to deliver our safety communication strategy for the Just Culture campaign.
This message has been delivered to employees to ensure they take an active role in improving the culture within our business.
Internal Health and Safety Environmental and Quality audits within all divisions.
Governance of the Safety Strategy The safety team oversees steers and challenges the progress of our safety performance and ensures that we continue to deliver.
Divisional senior managers are directly responsible for their risk registers and manage the actions required to mitigate or remove risks within their division.
The divisional senior managers also identify through continuous monitoring and review where potential new hazards could emerge within our business.
Since the year ended 29 February 2016 there has been an increase in the Group
There has been an increase of one RIDDOR on Group sites in comparison to the previous year.
17% reduction in nonRIDDOR accidents since the year ended 29 February 2016.
Making Safety Risks Clearer As part of the previous years safety strategy we introduced the BowTie system which is already widely used in the aviation industry for risk analysis.
BowTie is a visual tool which effectively depicts risk while providing an opportunity to identify and assess the key safety barriers either in place or lacking between a safety event and an unsafe outcome.
BowTie not only identifies the controls or barriers in place it also looks at control failure mechanisms as escalation factors and in turn how these are managed as escalation factor controls.
Based on these considerations insights are gained into the organisations risk mitigation strategies and therefore into the appropriate management of safety resources.
Using the BowTie system we have carried out assessments for the significant risks identified within the divisional risk registers allowing us to focus on the effectiveness of the control barriers we have in place.

The AFR is the way of measuring the accidents based on the category of accident which is reported to the Health and Safety Executive
The AFR is calculated by dividing the number of RIDDORs by the number of hours worked multiplied by 100000.

Handling Change With the aid of Stobart Information Management System SIMS the Group has access to realtime information on all incidents and accidents including near miss reports.
During 2016 data collected and analysed identified that Handling Lifting and Carrying was a significant underlying cause of workplace injuries.
With this in mind manual handling training company Handling Change was enlisted to assess the level of risk in daytoday tasks being performed in the Energy division.
This allowed them to provide the division with a bespoke training plan.
The initial training was delivered by Handling Change to 140 of our drivers.

Mental Health Awareness Campaign We recognise our responsibility for the wellbeing of our people which is why as part of our health and wellbeing strategy we decided to join forces with Carlisle Mind to design and deliver a mental health awareness campaign to our line managers and employees.
The aim of the workshops was to improve awareness and understanding of mental health issues and what help is available.
The workshops covered a range of issues from how to manage stress coping with grief identifying depression and how to help prevent suicide.
Lots of useful information on mental health awareness and where to seek help is placed on our employee portal for all of our employees to access.
In total 66 employees have attended these workshops but more are planned in the future.
Leadership Development We pride ourselves on continually improving our learning and development offering.
In 2016 we redesigned our management and leadership development programmes to ensure complete alignment within our diverse business.
Focusing on our two core programmes Developing Effective Management and Fast Track to Leadership these programmes are designed to enhance the skills of our existing managers and leaders and they are delivered inhouse in a way that enables our people to easily apply the learning to the workplace.
In 2016 75 of our managers completed either the Developing Effective Management or Fast Track to Leadership programme.
Performance Appraisals for our Mobile Workers Annual performance appraisals and capability conversations are conducted with our mobile workforce.
These allow employees and managers to give and receive twoway feedback on performancerelated areas.
In June 2016 the Company designed and implemented a new annual driver appraisal within the Stobart Energy division.
These appraisals are conducted by our Driver Trainers who prior to the appraisal receive feedback from the drivers Operations Manager and
The appraisals are conducted at the drivers place of work whilst they are carrying out their daily duties so that the Driver Trainers are able to provide live feedback on performance and also address any issues that the driver may be experiencing.
Since June 2016 over 70% of our driving workforce have been appraised with the remaining appraisals scheduled to be completed by summer 2017.
We are pleased to say that feedback from the drivers has been wholly positive and we are confident that this appraisal process will help with driver engagement and retention.
For our mobile workers within our Rail division capability conversations take place annually to help promote and develop behaviours attitudes and skillsets of the workforce.

Producing Our Own Solar Energy Our 2016 Annual Report and Accounts reported the development of a 2m and 3.2 hectare solar farm at London Southend Airport.
Since the installation the solar farm generated 55.1% of the airports total electricity requirement.
Following the success of this initiative our Stobart Energy division continued with our solar developments and gained planning permission in July 2015 for a 5MW solar farm located at our Pollington site.
The installation of all solar panels has now been completed and work to connect these to the National Grid is underway.
Occupying 12.9 hectares the purpose of generating electricity for export to the National Grid helps satisfy both renewable energy programmes and BES objectives.
Stobart Energy has also incorporated an ecological element into the scheme and opted for the sowing of a wildflower meadow between the solar cells and the planting of trees and shrubbery along site boundaries.

Sustainable Biomass  Contributing to the UKs Renewable Energy Stobart Energy continues to grow its network of sourcing processing and supplying renewable biomass fuel to industry and the energy sector whilst acting upon initiatives to encourage further environmental efficiency and compliance.
Environmental Protection and Resource Use During August 2016 Stobart Energy examined its processing activities to reduce the proportion of dust or fines arising from the shredding and screening of wood.
Following this review Stobart invested approximately 2.5m in slow speed shredding equipment resulting in reduced fines by approximately 10% and increasing the proportion of usable waste.
The residual fines are currently used in landfill restoration projects returning sites to agricultural or amenity use.

REPORT GOVERNANCE
STATEMENTS
Engagement of the External Auditor The external auditor is engaged to express an opinion on the Groups financial statements.
The audit includes the review and testing of the systems of internal financial control and the data contained in the financial statements to the extent necessary for expressing an audit opinion on the truth and fairness of the financial statements.
KPMG LLP KPMG has been the Companys auditor since their appointment in September 2012.
KPMG provides the Committee with relevant reports reviews and advice throughout the year as set out in their terms of engagement.
Nonaudit fees charged by the auditors in the year were 82000 compared with an audit fee of 333000.
The nonaudit fee relates to tax advisory work and the half year review.
The objectivity and independence of the auditors has been reviewed and considered to be safeguarded.
Significant Accounting Matters As part of their monitoring of the integrity of the financial statements the Committee reviews whether suitable accounting policies have been adopted whether management has made appropriate judgements and estimates and also seeks support from the external auditors to assess them.
The main issues reviewed for the year ended 28 February 2017 are set out below Impairment Testing of Goodwill Other Intangible Assets and Property Plant and Equipment The Committee considered the carrying values of goodwill other intangible assets and property plant and equipment together with the assumptions underlying the impairment reviews.
The judgements in relation to the impairment testing largely relate to the assumptions underlying the valueinuse and net realisable value calculations for the assets being tested for impairment.
These were primarily the achievability of longterm business plans and macroeconomic assumptions underlying the valuation process together with the appropriateness of the discount factors used.
This is a prime area of audit focus and accordingly the external auditor provided detailed reporting to the Committee.
The Committee challenged the assumptions made both by management and by the auditors by reference to those used in previous years and to changes in business performance and outlook.
The Committee discussed the sensitivities to key assumptions.
The Committee concluded that no impairment charges were necessary in the year except in relation to the goodwill arising on the business combination with Everdeal Holdings Limited as mentioned in the paragraph below.
In accordance with UK regulations the Companys auditor adheres to a partner rotation policy in line with these regulations.
This was the fifth year since appointment and was the final year before the requirement to rotate the Group lead engagement partner.
A new lead engagement partner has been appointed by KPMG for the forthcoming year.
During the year the performance of the auditor was formally assessed by the Committee in conjunction with the senior management team.
In making this assessment the Committee focused on the robustness of the audit the quality of delivery of audit services and the quality of the auditors staff.
The
Committee is satisfied that the audit continues to be effective and provides an appropriate independent challenge of the Groups senior management.
Whilst it will continue to review this annually the Committee does not plan to carry out another tender process this year as the cost and disruption that would be caused to the Groups businesses by an audit tender process outweighs any benefit to shareholders from a more frequent change.
The Committee has a policy for the use of auditors for nonaudit services.
The Committee is responsible for considering the following prior to engaging the auditors for nonaudit work the scope of the work to be undertaken whether the skills and experience of the audit firm make it a suitable supplier of the nonaudit service whether there are safeguards in place to ensure that there is no threat to objectivity and independence in the conduct of the audit resulting from the provision of such nonaudit services by the external auditor the nature of the nonaudit services the related fee levels and the fee levels individually and in aggregate relative to the audit fee and the criteria which govern the compensation of the individuals performing the audit.
In addition to this the policy states in detail a number of additional controls.
A full copy of this policy is available on the Stobart Group website.
ACTIVITIES DURING THE YEAR During the year the Committee met three times and a summary of the main areas dealt with during the year are set out below Findings from the external audit for the year ended 29 February Findings from the external review by the auditors of the interim results to 31 August 2016 Review of findings from the internal audit projects conducted during the year Approval of the audit plan and strategy for the year ended 28 February 2017 Review of the significant judgements and estimates applied in preparation of the Annual Report Review of the Annual Report to ensure it is fair balanced and understandable Review of the viability statement Review of acquisition accounting in relation to the two business combinations in the year Confirmation of the independence of the external auditors Review of the Group risk register Review of the implications of the revised UK Corporate Governance Code on risk management internal control and going concern Consideration of the terms of reference of the Audit Committee 52 Stobart Group Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Accounting for Business
During the year the Group acquired control of two businesses in which the Group had previously held equity interests Everdeal Holdings Limited and Propius Holdings Limited.
Prior to acquiring controlling interests the results of these investments were equity accounted.
The Committee considered the accounting for the business combinations the fair value adjustments made and the presentation and disclosures made in the Annual
The Committee is satisfied that it is appropriate to provide against the goodwill arising on the accounting for the acquisition of Everdeal Holdings Limited.
Investment Property and Assets Held for Sale Valuations The value of property held by the Group has reduced significantly over the year following a number of disposals.
The three remaining properties are classified as investment property or assets held for sale.
The Committee assured itself that appropriate independent valuations had been obtained for the investment portfolio and that where necessary provisions had been made against properties held for sale where it was felt that market conditions required them.
Classification of Investments in Subsidiary Undertakings Joint Ventures and Associates The Group holds investments in a number of companies and a small number of other entities.
The Committee reviewed the accounting treatment of these investments proposed by management categorised as either subsidiary undertakings joint ventures or associates by reference to accounting standards.
The Committee is satisfied that the accounting treatments appropriately follow the levels of control or influence available to the Group.
Valuation of Property Inventories The carrying value of property inventories held by the Group has increased significantly.
Judgements have been made in relation to the development of these assets.
The Committee has reviewed these judgements and is satisfied that the assets are held at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

The Board continually monitors the Groups risk register reviewing in detail the principal risks affecting the Groups performance.
The risks and uncertainties which are currently judged to have the most significant impact on the Groups longterm performance are set out on pages 27 to 30.
Internal Audit The Groups Safety and Compliance team perform audits against documented processes.
Reports summarising the findings and key actions arising from the reviews are produced for circulation to the Executive Directors and divisional management.
During the year the Group appointed an external firm to act as a dedicated financial internal audit function with an initial twoyear agreed scope.
There were seven projects completed during the year with reports summarising the findings and recommendations. at each Audit Committee meeting.
Nonunderlying items The Group has a number of material items that warrant separate presentation in the Consolidated Income Statement and a number of these are presented as nonunderlying.
The Committee has reviewed the items disclosed as non underlying and are satisfied that they have been presented in accordance with the Groups accounting policy.
Fair Balanced and Understandable
The Committee acknowledges that taken as a whole the Annual Report and Accounts needs to be fair balanced and understandable in order to provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Groups position and performance business model and strategy.
The Committee advises the Board on whether it believes that the Annual Report and Accounts meet this requirement.
In order for the Committee to make this assessment it considers reports from management received during the year that monitor financial performance and at the year end in support of the financial statements and also reports from external auditors on the findings of their annual audit.
Formal review processes are in place to ensure that the Annual Report and Accounts are factually accurate.
Following a detailed review the Committee concluded that the Annual Report was fair balanced and understandable and advised the Board accordingly.
The responsibility statement of the Directors in respect of the Annual Report is on page 70.
Risk Management and
Internal Control The Committee is responsible for reviewing the effectiveness of the Groups system of internal control.
The system of internal control is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.

STATEMENTS
Notes to the Policy Table Differences in the Remuneration Policy Between Executive Directors and Other Employees Salaries across the Group reflect the skill expertise and experience of individual staff members.
Certain senior members of staff are entitled to a bonus based on broadly similar criteria as the Executive Directors i.
70% based on EBITDA and 30% based on personalstrategic objectives.
Some are also invited to participate in a LTIP scheme again based on broadly similar criteria as the scheme in which the Executive Directors participate.
As of 1 May 2017 all employees will be enrolled into a new Health Cash Plan which includes a range of benefits including discounts off routine dental and optical treatment.
This is to enhance our remuneration offering.
All employees are also eligible to join the Company autoenrolment pension scheme where contributions vary depending on service or contract.
Changes to the Remuneration Policy The Executive Directors Remuneration Policy saw significant changes in 2014.
The changes to the Policy brought remuneration structures broadly into line with market norms for a company of Stobarts size while retaining the capacity to incentivise truly exceptional performance.
As highlighted in the Remuneration Committee Chairmans statement a new Remuneration Policy will be presented to shareholders for approval at our AGM on 29 June 2017.
During the year the Committee reviewed the current Policy and determined that no substantial changes are required at this time as we believe it remains appropriate for retaining and incentivising the Executive team.
We are therefore resubmitting our current policy for reapproval with only minor updates to Clarify the extent of Remuneration Committee discretion see next section Strengthen malus and clawback conditions by adding provisions for miscalculation and risktaking in excess of what has been approved by the Board as well as to clarify that malus and clawback provisions can apply for a period of two years from the date of annual bonus payment or LTIP vesting Update information as required e.
Make it shorter and easier to read.
Remuneration Committee Discretion This Policy Report permits the Remuneration Committee limited discretion in implementing the Policy without needing to refer to shareholders for a further vote.
Fixed remuneration elements salaries pensions and benefits may be adjusted within the limits set out in the Policy to maintain market competitiveness.
Pensions may be paid in the form of pension contributions or an equivalent cash supplement.
Annual bonus performance measures and weightings may be adjusted subject to the limits that no less than 50% will be based on profit and no more than 30% on personal and strategic objectives.
The definition of financial measures used may be updated.

The calibration of EPS performance conditions may be altered e. relative to RPI.
T argets for outstanding awards may be adjusted if events unduly affect the achievability of targets.
The calibration of TSR may be changed for new cycles prior to grant provided the toughness of the targets is broadly similar.

The Committee also has discretion Over the application of malus and clawback in the prescribed circumstances.
T o adjust the formulaic bonus or LTIP outcomes to ensure they reflect the Groups overall financial performance do not result in any outcome that is inconsistent with the Groups remuneration principles does not incentivise any shortterm decisions or behaviours and take into account any significant health and safety environmental social or governance event that materially affects the Companys reputation.
T o determine any additional cash andor benefits to replace awards relinquished by new recruits at a former employer under Listing Rule 9.4.2R.

The fair value of any buyout will not exceed that of the awards being replaced.
The granting of good leaver status which will generally follow HMRC guidance.
Awards held by good leavers will continue subject to prorating for time and continuation of performance conditions.
The payment of any Directors legal fees for settlement agreements.
Choice of Performance Measures for the Annual Bonus and LTIP  and Approach to TargetSetting Annual bonus measures are selected at the beginning of the financial year.
EBITDA was selected again for the year to 28 February 2018 as it is considered the best indicator of annual performance for most of Stobarts divisions.
T argets are set in line with budget which is intended to be stretching but achievable and the range between threshold and stretch performance is considered annually by the Remuneration
The remaining annual bonus is based on specific relevant personalstrategic metrics which are selected by the Board and approved by the Remuneration Committee at the beginning of each financial year to reflect the most pertinent personalstrategic goals for the year ahead.
Stobart Group Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Regarding the LTIP  the Remuneration Committee feels that relative TSR continues to be the best measure of the longterm success of Stobart Group and that the FTSE 250 T otal Return Index remains a suitably robust and relevant benchmark.
Supplementing this with an EPS measure helps focus management on growing Stobarts revenues and margins and provides a good balance of internal and external and absolute and relative measures.
In setting targets for relative TSR outperformance of the FTSE 250 Index the Remuneration Committee aims to align the vesting schedule of the TSR element of the LTIP with FTSE market practice with threshold vesting of 25% of the TSR proportion initially awarded for performance in line with the Index increasing on a straightline basis to full vesting initially awarded for outperformance of the Index by 10% p.
When considering the vesting schedule for the LTIP multiplier the Remuneration Committee also sets targets which are designed to incentivise performance beyond upper quartile.
Note that the multiplier does not apply unless the EPS condition is met in full.
Threeyear cumulative earnings per share targets are set based on a range of internal and external forecasts including broker forecasts internal strategic plan etc.
A similar process for targetsetting would be applied in the event that any additional financial performance metric was included.
The
Remuneration Committee may adjust EPS targets during the performance period if it feels that external events outside management control for example changes in tax regime accounting rules and so on have affected the achievability and hence motivational quality of the targets.
Approach to Remuneration for New Director Appointments The remuneration package for the appointment of a new Executive Director would be set in accordance with the terms and maximum levels of the approved Remuneration Policy in force at that time.
In addition the Remuneration Committee may offer additional cash andor benefits if it considers these to be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders up to the fair value of the remuneration relinquished when leaving the former employer.
This would take into account the nature and vesting horizons attached to any remuneration forfeited and the impact of any performance conditions.
T o facilitate this the Remuneration Committee may need to avail itself of the discretion provided under Listing Rule 9.4.2R.
The Company does not intend to use Listing Rule 9.4.2R for any other purpose than a buyout at up to fair value.
Shareholders will be informed of any such payments at the time of appointment.
For an internal appointment any variable pay element awarded in respect of the previous role will be honoured.
For the appointment of a new Chairman or NonExecutive Director the Director fees would be set in accordance with the approved Remuneration Policy in force at that time.
Service Contracts and Loss of Office Payments The Remuneration Committees policy on service contracts includes that they be limited to a maximum notice period of one year.
All Director contracts comply with this policy.
The Remuneration Committee is also under a duty to ensure contractual terms on termination and any payments made are fair to the individual and to the Group that failure is not rewarded and that liabilities of the Group are mitigated wherever possible.
If the Group terminates the employment of an Executive Director without giving the period of notice required under the contract the Executive Director would be entitled to claim recompense for up to one years remuneration as follows Notice period 12 months
Payments in lieu of notice of salary and benefits including health cover a company car or car allowance life and health insurance and pension.
Payments in lieu of notice are not pensionable.
Change of control There are no enhanced provisions on a change of control.
In some circumstances the Remuneration Committee may also at its discretion pay a bonus to the Director equivalent to the amount to which they would have been entitled to prorated over the portion of the year that they worked.
Under the LTIP  the default treatment is that any outstanding awards lapse on termination of employment.
However in certain prescribed good leaver circumstances the awards remain subject to performance conditions measured to the end of the performance period and reduced by reference to the portion of the period they were employed.
The Remuneration Committee retains discretion to pay Directors legal fees for settlement agreements.
For the purposes of this Policy the Committee interprets the term good leaver to follow normal HMRC guidance which will also allow them discretion in some circumstances where a Director leaves the Company for reasons other than those outlined by HMRC but whose performance merits such award as determined by the Remuneration Committee.
The Executive Directors service contracts for Andrew Tinkler and Richard Butcher are dated 21 September 2007.
Service contracts are available for inspection at the Companys registered office during normal business hours.
NonExecutive Directors are engaged under letters of appointment that set out their duties and responsibilities.
They are appointed for an initial period of one year subject to annual shareholder reelection.
Their continued appointment is subject to the requirements of the Companys Articles 74 relating to the retirement of Directors by rotation.

Views of Shareholders We are committed to engaging appropriately with our shareholders and our aim is to have an open dialogue on all relevant matters including remuneration.
Each year there are meetings with major shareholders to review the Groups performance and financial position.
Executive pay is on the table for discussion at such meetings and we believe that it is better to do so as part of an overall review that puts pay in the context of overall Group performance.
Consideration of Others Such as Employees We have a comprehensive employee engagement and communication programme where knowledge ideas and feedback are shared.
Communication is encouraged through various methods including our divisional employee forums which are led by Executive Director Richard Butcher.
Stobart
Central is an employee intranet site introduced to improve the engagement of staff Your Say was an employee survey carried out in October 2016 and the popular Tink T alk monthly messages from Andrew Tinkler CEO provide updates to employees on whats happening across the business and allows all staff to provide feedback on matters important to them.
Currently there is no formal consultation with employees specifically on Board remuneration.
Legacy Arrangements For the avoidance of doubt this Policy includes authority for the Company to honour any commitments entered into with current or former Directors that have been disclosed to shareholders previously.
Details of any payments to current or former Directors will of course be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise.

Our people strategy is centred on employee engagement and over the last 12 months Stobart Group has taken a number of positive steps to ensure that wherever possible our employees are absorbed in their job role and are enthusiastic about their work and the success of our business.
In order to establish our current level of employee engagement in October 2016 we carried out an employee survey with all employees and we received a very pleasing overall response rate of 85%.
Within this survey there were five employee engagement index questions which gave a very pleasing average score of 87%.
This confirms that overall our employees are engaged with Stobart Group.
However we do not rest on our laurels and following the survey our line managers have been meeting with their teams to gain further feedback and compile action plans on how we can improve things even further.

Our assessment of risks of material misstatement In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit in decreasing order of audit significance were as follows The risk Our response Impairment of goodwill intangible assets and property plant and equipment Goodwill 59.0 million 2016 59.0 million Intangible assets 49.3 million 2016 53.3 million Property plant and equipment PPE 326.3 million 2016 218.0 million Refer to page 51 Audit Committee Report page 86 accounting policy and pages 99 and 102103 financial disclosures.

Stobart Group Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2017 2.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement continued The risk Our response Classification and valuation of investments in subsidiaries associates and joint ventures 59.2 million 2016 62.7 million Refer to page 52 Audit Committee Report page 90 accounting policy and pages 100101 financial disclosures.
Accounting treatment The Group holds investments in a number of investees.
The risk of inappropriate classification of an investment as a subsidiary associate or joint venture both on acquisition or in subsequent reporting periods can have a material effect on the financial statements and involves judgement as to whether the Group controls the investee in particular where the Group ownership interest is not a decisive factor.
Although the risk of incorrect classification is lower in the periods subsequent to initial investment there were changes during the year to facts and circumstances and to the Groups holdings that may mean previous conclusions are no longer appropriate.
Forecastbased valuation The risk of inappropriate valuation of investments in associates and joint ventures arises as the Groups assessment of realisable value will be dependent on future trading performance of each individual investment and hence on the Groups estimates of the likely future cash flows of the underlying investee repayment of loan balances and disposal value.
The assessed level of risk has reduced since the prior year following the acquisitions of 100% interests in Propius Holdings Limited and Everdeal Holdings Limited that result in those investees being whollyowned subsidiaries by yearend and the partial disposal post yearend of Greenwhitestar Holding Company 1 Limited and Greenwhitestar Finance Limited which provides evidence of the investments valuation.
Our procedures included Accounting analysis We reviewed the Groups historical accounting analysis in conjunction with our historical examination of legal investment documents that determined the key terms including rights of the investors terms of shareholders agreements termination provisions governance structures and profitsharing arrangements.
We then considered whether any changes had occurred since the prior period which would warrant a change in classification Comparing valuations To evaluate the Groups estimates we assessed the investees recent performance by reviewing the most recent audited financial statements and management accounts at the year end date.
We also considered relevant external indicators over valuation including offers for sale and announcements in respect of future transactions and assessed underlying cash flow models of certain investments and Assessing transparency We have considered the adequacy of the Groups disclosures in respect of the classification and valuation of investments in subsidiaries associates and joint ventures.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit in decreasing order of audit significance were as follows The risk Our response Impairment of goodwill intangible assets and property plant and equipment Goodwill 59.0 million 2016 59.0 million Intangible assets 49.3 million 2016 53.3 million Property plant and equipment PPE 326.3 million 2016 218.0 million Refer to page 51 Audit Committee Report page 86 accounting policy and pages 99 and 102103 financial disclosures.

Our assessment of risks of material misstatement continued The risk Our response Classification and valuation of investment property own use properties assets held for sale and inventory Investment property 3.2 million 2016 47.0 million Own use properties 156.4 million 2016 169.3 million Assets held for sale 13.1 million 2016 5.4 million Inventory 60.0 million 2016 Refer to page 52 Audit Committee Report page 89 accounting policy and pages 101 103 and 104 financial disclosures.
Accounting treatment The Group has a significant property portfolio.
The classification of properties as own use investment property held for sale HFS or inventory is based on how the property is initially and subsequently used and intentions for future use or disposal which can change periodically leading to a risk that properties may not be appropriately classified.
For properties classified as inventory the net realisable value is based on the intended development and future sales of these properties.
Subjective valuation The valuation of investment property assets HFS and inventory requires significant judgement and estimation around market pricing demand and timing of development or disposal.
The
Directors also exercise judgement in choosing the most appropriate valuation methodology which contains a mix of independent valuation of properties internal value in use and net realisable value calculations supported by external assumptions where applicable for own use properties and inventory.
The assessed level of risk has increased during the year as due to the continued strategy of the Group to dispose of its noncore assets plans have started to crystallise.
This increase in risk is primarily attributed to the Widnes and Runcorn development land inventory.
Our procedures included Tests of details We analysed the classification of each significant asset against its specific actual and intended use by making inquiries of Directors inspecting development plans and proposals and evaluating communication with external parties.
This included an assessment of any changes to the actual and intended use compared with the prior period Assessing valuers credentials Investment property was subject to an independent valuation by an external valuer engaged by the Group.
We evaluated the competence capabilities and objectivity of this external valuer Comparing valuations For HFS properties we compared the carrying amount to the value at which the properties are currently being marketed for sale and expected to be realised Sensitivity analysis We performed sensitivity analysis in respect of key assumptions such as the level of rental income and exit yields underlying the calculation of the expected sales proceeds and the expected level of capital expenditure in developing the asset Our sector experience We utilised our own real estate specialists primarily for inventory and investment property assets to challenge the appropriateness of the assumptions and valuation methods used by the Directors and the external valuer comparing the Groups assumptions to externally derived data as well as to our own assessment in relation to yield rates on a geographical and property type basis and Assessing transparency We have considered the adequacy of the Groups disclosures in respect of the classification and valuation of investment property HFS properties own use properties and inventories to confirm that the key judgements taken in arriving at the appropriate classification and valuation are adequately disclosed.
Stobart Group Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Our assessment of risks of material misstatement continued The risk Our response Accounting for acquisitions Everdeal Holdings Limited consideration to obtain control 0.6m goodwill acquired 28.3m Propius Holdings Limited consideration to obtain control 11.8m gain on acquisition 1.3m Refer to page 52 Audit Committee Report page 85 accounting policy and page 93 financial disclosures.
During the year the Group acquired controlling interests in Everdeal Holdings Limited and Propius Holdings Limited which were previously an associate and a joint venture respectively.
These acquisitions have had a material impact on the financial statements resulting in goodwill on acquisition of Everdeal Holdings Limited which was subsequently impaired in full at year end and a gain on acquisition of Propius Holdings Limited which has been recognised in the income statement.
Accounting treatment In assessing control judgement was required in determining the ability of the other shareholders to restrict the Groups ability to control the investee through previously held shareholder agreements and therefore the date at which the group gained control of the investee.
Accounting treatment The Everdeal Holdings Limited and Propius Holdings Limited transactions involved a common other shareholder and were viewed by the Directors as being commercially linked transactions.
Consequently there is a risk that the transactions should be accounted as one for accounting purposes resulting in a different allocation of consideration and goodwill.
Forecastbased valuation Significant judgement is required in respect of the completeness and accuracy of fair value adjustments recognition and valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets.
The focus was on fair value adjustments pertaining to assets in Propius Holdings Limited and completeness of liabilities in Everdeal Holdings Limited.
Our procedures included Accounting analysis We reviewed each acquisitions sale and purchase agreements.
We assessed the factors surrounding control including reviewing any previous shareholder agreements to understand the rights that remaining non controlling interests held.
We assessed whether and at what point control was obtained based on our consideration of these factors.
We compared our assessment to that of the Directors Comparing valuation In respect of the acquisition of Propius Holdings Limited we assessed the fair value adjustments in respect of the aircraft and loans by reviewing external valuations and market data External confirmation In respect of the acquisition of Everdeal Holdings Limited we assessed the completeness of provisions by comparing to legal confirmations Our sector experience In respect of both acquisitions we applied our knowledge of the business and industry to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of fair value adjustments in respect of intangible assets and contingent liabilities Accounting analysis We assessed whether the acquisitions are to be considered to be one transaction by analysing the facts and circumstances of the acquisitions against applicable accounting guidance.
We also reviewed the goodwill acquired in respect of Everdeal Holdings Limited and the gain on acquisition in respect of Propius Holdings Limited and assessed whether due to the inherent commercial link between these acquisitions the goodwill was allocated correctly.
We also challenged whether the impairment of the Everdeal Holdings Limited goodwill was appropriate given this occurred in the same period as the acquisition by obtaining and understanding the basis for the impairment calculations and Assessing transparency We have considered the adequacy of the Groups disclosures in respect of the acquisitions including the presentation of the impairment of goodwill in respect of Everdeal Holdings Limited and the gain on acquisition in respect of Propius Holdings Limited.

Presentation appropriateness The Group has a number of material income statement items that the Directors have separately presented in the income statement and a number of these are presented as nonunderlying activities.
Whilst this is not prohibited inappropriate use of this presentation or a lack of clear explanation or reconciliation to relevant GAAP measures can distort the financial results for the year or result in difficulty understanding the true performance of the business.
Our procedures included Assessing application We held detailed discussions with the Group to understand the nature of each item and whether those items would be more appropriately presented as underlying.
We obtained external evidence such as a sample of invoices in respect of the items to verify that they matched the description of the nonunderlying items.
We also considered whether the accounting policy had been applied consistently with prior periods Assessing balance We considered whether the presentation of items as underlying or nonunderlying was a fair and balanced representation of the financial results and Assessing transparency We reviewed the narrative reporting contained in the Annual Report and assessed whether references to nonGAAP measures could be appropriately understood by reference to reconciliations of nonGAAP measures to relevant GAAP measures.
Furthermore we have considered the adequacy of the Groups accounting policy disclosures in respect of the classification of items as nonunderlying.
Stobart Group Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at 1.2m determined with reference to a benchmark of Group revenue of which it represents 0.93% 2016 0.79%.
We consider Group revenue to be the most appropriate benchmark as it provides a more stable measure yearonyear than Group profit before tax or other alternatives in particular given the early stage of the lifecycle of the Groups main trading divisions and the volatility of profitslosses from property transactions and revaluations.
We reported to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected misstatements exceeding 50000 in addition to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
The Group team performed full scope audits for group purposes on four 2016 six of the Groups nine 2016 seven.
The remaining five 2016 one components were subject to full scope audits for group purposes by KPMG component auditors of which two 2016 none included members of the Group team.
The Group team instructed component auditors as to the significant areas to be covered including the relevant risks detailed above and the information to be reported back.
The Group team determined the materiality for each component to be 750000 having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the group across the components.
The components within the scope of our work accounted for the percentages illustrated opposite.
For the components not audited by the Group audit partner nor members of the group team video and telephone conference meetings were held at the planning stage to assess and communicate the audit risks and strategy.
Similar meetings were held at the completion stage where the findings reported to the Group team were discussed in more detail and any further work required by the Group team was then performed by the component auditor.
For components that did not involve the Group team these meetings also involved a remote review of the significant risk areas contained within the electronic audit file.

The policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented unless otherwise stated.
These Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs and IFRIC interpretations as adopted by the European Union adopted IFRSs.
The financial statements of the Group are also prepared in accordance with the Companies Guernsey Law 2008.
Stobart Group Limited is a Guernsey registered company.
The Companys ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
Measurement Convention The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value derivative financial instruments and investment property.
Noncurrent assets and assets held for sale are stated at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Going Concern The Groups business activities together with factors likely to affect its future performance and position are set out in the Chief Executives Statement on pages 10 to 11 and the financial position of the Group its cash flows and funding are set out in the Financial Review on pages 31 to 33.
Note 22 on page 104 of the financial statements includes details of the Groups loans and borrowings at the year end together with the Groups objectives policies and processes for managing its capital its financial risk management objectives details of its financial instruments and its exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable financial resources together with contracts with a number of customers and suppliers.
The financial forecasts show that the Groups remaining borrowing facilities are adequate such that the Group can operate within these facilities and meet its obligations when they fall due for at least 12 months.
After making enquiries the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
Changes in Accounting Policy and Disclosures The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except as follows New Standards Amendments to Existing Standards and Interpretations to Existing Standards Adopted by the Group Amendments arising from the Annual Improvement Project 20122014 were endorsed by the EU for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2016.
There were separate transitional provisions for each amendment.
The adoption of the amendments did not have any material impact on the financial position or performance of the Group.
The following standards and amendments have an effective date after the date of these financial statements International Accounting Standards and amendments IASIFRSs Effective for accounting periods commencing on or after Proposed adoption in the year ending IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2018 28 February 2019 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2018 28 February 2019 IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019 29 February 2020 Annual Improvement Project 20142016 1 January 2017 28 February 2018 IFRS 15 The Group is in the process of analysing the impact of this standard however the impact has yet to be quantified.
IFRS 16 Leases was issued in January 2016 and will have a significant impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements although given the timing of the issue of this standard at this stage it has not been practicable to quantify the full effect this standard will have on the Groups consolidated financial statements upon transition.
IFRS 16 with certain exceptions requires the Group where the Group is a lessee to recognise right of use assets and lease liabilities for all leases there no longer being a distinction between operating and finance leases for lessees.
Finally the profile of the Group Consolidated Income Statement impact for items previously accounted for as operating leases is likely to change for the Group where the Group is a lessee with a higher periodic expense in the earlier periods of a lease.
This standard is likely to have a significant impact on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and Consolidated Income Statement presentation and measurement.
A project to oversee the implementation of this standard is in progress.
The adoption of all the other standards amendments and interpretations is not expected to have a material effect on the net assets results and disclosures of the Group.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Revenue for services rendered by Stobart Aviation and the transport element of the Stobart Energy business segments is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement on the delivery of those services based on the proportion of the total delivered at the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position date.
It is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable net of returns contracted trade discounts volume rebates and VAT.
The principal sources of revenue within the Stobart Group Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2017 For more information visit siteinvestors
REPORT GOVERNANCE
STATEMENTS
Aviation division are aviation income retail and catering income surface access income and fuel sales income.
Revenue from Stobart Infrastructure and the supply element of the Stobart Energy business segment is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable net of returns contracted trade discounts volume rebates and VAT.
Revenue is recognised when significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer recovery of the consideration is probable the associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably there is no continuing management involvement with the goods and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
If it is probable that contracted discounts will be granted and the amount can be measured reliably then the discount is recognised as a reduction of revenue as the sales are recognised.
Stobart Infrastructure also recognises rental income from investment property.
This revenue is recognised on a straightline basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives granted are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income over the term of the lease.
Stobart Rail contract revenue includes the initial amount agreed in the contract plus any variations in contract work claims and incentive payments to the extent that it is probable that they will result in revenue and can be measured reliably.
This contract revenue is recognised by stage of completion.
Contract expenses are recognised as incurred unless they create an asset related to future contract activity.
An expected loss on a contract is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Revenue is analysed by segment in note 3 on pages 91 to 93.
Presentation of Consolidated Income Statement The presentation of the Consolidated Income Statement shows the underlying results and nonunderlying results including nonunderlying items included in the Groups share of profits of associates and joint ventures in separate columns.
These nonunderlying items are material incomes and expenses which because of their nature infrequency or occurrence or the events giving rise to them merit separate presentation to allow shareholders to better understand the financial performance for the period.
Underlying operating profit and underlying profit before tax are nonGAAP measures which comprise operating profit and profit before tax respectively before non underlying items.
The columnar format is considered to be the clearest method of presentation of this information.
NonGAAP measures are used as they are considered to be both useful and necessary.
They are used for internal performance analysis the presentation of these measures facilitates comparability with other companies although managements measures may not be calculated in the same way as similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
Functional and Presentation Currency The Groups functional currencies are GBP  USD and EUR.
The Group has adopted GBP as its presentational currency.
Basis of Consolidation Where the Company has the power either directly or indirectly to control the relevant activities of another entity or business has exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to use its power over the entity to affect the amount of the returns to the Company it is classified as a subsidiary.
The consolidated financial statements present the results of Stobart Group Limited and its subsidiaries the Group as if they formed a single entity.
Intercompany transactions and balances between Group companies are therefore eliminated in full.
Business Combinations Business Combinations from 1 March 2010 Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree.
Acquisition costs are expensed and included in transaction costs which are reported below underlying profit.
When the Group acquires a business it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date.
Any contingent consideration payable to be transferred by the acquirer is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate of the acquisitiondate fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for the noncontrolling interest and where the business combination is achieved in stages the acquisitiondate fair value of the acquirers previously held equity interest in the acquiree over the net identifiable amounts of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in exchange for the business combination.
Identifiable intangible assets meeting either the contractual legal or separability criterion are recognised separately from goodwill.
Contingent liabilities representing a present obligation are recognised if the acquisition date fair value can be measured reliably.
If the aggregate of the acquisitiondate fair value of the consideration transferred and where the business combination is achieved in stages the acquisitiondate fair value of the acquirers previously held equity interest in the acquiree is lower than the fair value of the assets liabilities and contingent liabilities and the fair value of any preexisting interest held in the business acquired the difference is recognised in profit and loss within nonunderlying.
After initial recognition goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
For the purpose of impairment testing goodwill acquired in a business combination is from the acquisition date allocated to each of the Groups cash generating units or groups of cashgenerating units that are expected to benefit from the combination irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
Each unit or group of units to which goodwill is allocated shall represent the lowest level within the entity at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and shall not be larger than an operating segment before aggregation.
Stobart Group Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Business Combinations prior to 1 March 2010 Business combinations were accounted for using the purchase method.
Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition formed part of the acquisition costs.
The minority interest is accounted for using the Parententity extension method whereby the difference between the consideration paid and the book value of the share in net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Goodwill was initially measured at cost being the excess of the cost of business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets liabilities and contingent liabilities.
Where the net fair value of the acquired entitys identifiable assets liabilities and contingent liabilities was greater than the cost of investment the difference was recognised in profit and loss.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over the interest in the fair value of identifiable assets liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Cost comprises the fair values of assets given liabilities incurred and equity instruments issued.
Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset with any impairment in carrying value being charged to the Consolidated Income
Where the fair value of identifiable assets liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the fair value of consideration paid the excess is credited in full to the Consolidated Income Statement.
Impairment of NonFinancial Assets Excluding Investment Properties and Deferred Tax Assets Impairment tests of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are undertaken at least annually at the financial year end and also if there are indicators of impairment.
Other non financial assets are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount i. value less costs to sell the asset is written down accordingly.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset the impairment test is carried out on the assets cashgenerating unit i. inflows.
Goodwill is allocated on initial recognition to each of the Groups cashgenerating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination giving rise to the goodwill.
Impairment charges are included in the Consolidated Income Statement except to the extent they reverse gains previously recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Other Comprehensive Income.
Impairment losses except losses relating to goodwill can be reversed in certain circumstances.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such indication exists the recoverable amount is estimated.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount.
That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined net of depreciation had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Such reversal is recognised in profit or loss unless the asset is carried at revalued amount in which case the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase.
After such a reversal the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the assets revised carrying amount less any residual value on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash in hand demand deposits and highly liquid investments readily convertible to known amounts of cash and subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial Instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as fuel swaps to mitigate the risk of fuel price fluctuations.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value at each reporting date.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
Forward contracts are entered into by the Group to purchase andor sell biomassrelated products and management judges that these forward commodity contracts are entered into for the Groups own use rather than as trading instruments.
They continue to be held in accordance with the Groups expected purchase sale andor usage requirements.
Accordingly these contracts are not accounted for as derivatives or other financial instruments.
Foreign Currency Transactions entered into by Group entities in a currency other than the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate their functional currency are recorded at the rates ruling when the transactions occur.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates ruling at the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position date.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of unsettled monetary assets and liabilities are recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into GBP at the rate of exchange prevailing at the Statement of Financial Position date.
The income statements are translated at the average rate.
The exchange differences arising on the translation are taken directly to a separate component of equity.
Financial Assets Unless otherwise indicated the carrying amounts of the Groups financial assets are a reasonable approximation of their fair values.

REPORT GOVERNANCE
STATEMENTS
Loans and Receivables These assets are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They arise principally through the provision of goods and services to customers e. incorporate other types of contractual monetary asset.
They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method less provision for impairment.
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence such as significant financial difficulties on the part of the counterparty or default or significant delay in payment that the Group will be unable to collect all of the amounts due under the terms receivable the amount of such a provision being the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future expected cash flows associated with the impaired receivable.
For trade receivables which are reported net such provisions are recorded in a separate allowance account with the loss being recognised within operating expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement.
On confirmation that the trade receivable will not be collectable the gross carrying value of the asset is written off against the associated provision.
Financial Liabilities Unless otherwise indicated the carrying amounts of the Groups financial liabilities are a reasonable approximation of their fair values.
Loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value net of any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the instrument.
Such interestbearing liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method which ensures that any interest expense over the period to repayment is at a constant rate on the balance of the liability carried in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
Trade payables and other shortterm monetary liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Share Capital Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they do not meet the definition of a financial liability.
The Groups ordinary shares are classified as equity instruments.
Own Shares Held by Employee Benefit Trust Stobart Group Limited shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust are designated as own shares held classified in shareholders equity and recognised at cost.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity with any difference between the proceeds from sale and original cost taken to retained earnings.
Treasury Shares When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased the amount of the consideration paid which includes directly attributable costs net of any tax effects is recognised as a deduction from equity.
When share capital held in treasury is subsequently disposed of the proceeds of sale net of any directly attributable costs are recognised as an addition to equity.
Pension Arrangements and Other PostEmployment Benefits The Group has pension schemes of both a defined benefit and defined contribution nature.
The Groups defined benefit pension liability which is assessed each period by actuaries is based on key assumptions including return on plan assets discount rates mortality rates inflation and future salary and pension costs.
These assumptions individually or collectively may be different to actual outcomes.
Other key assumptions for pension obligations are based in part on current market conditions.
Additional information is disclosed in note 23 on page 107.
The liability in respect of defined benefit schemes is the present value of the relevant defined benefit obligation at the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position date less the fair value of scheme assets.
The trustees commission a full actuarial valuation triennially and the present value of the obligation is updated annually by external professional actuaries using the projected unit method for financial reporting purposes.
The present value of the obligation is determined by the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of highquality corporate bonds which have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related liability.
The current service cost and gains and losses on settlements and curtailments are recognised in operating costs in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Past service costs are included in operating costs where the benefits have vested.
The Group determines the net interest expenseincome on the net defined benefit liabilityasset for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the thennet defined benefit liabilityasset taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liabilityasset during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments.
Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in profit or loss.
Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability which comprise actuarial gains and losses the return on plan assets excluding interest and the effect of the asset ceiling if any excluding interest are recognised immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
For defined contribution schemes costs are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement as they accrue.
ShareBased Payments Where equitysettled share options are awarded to employees the fair value of the options at the date of grant is normally charged to the Consolidated Income Statement over the vesting period.
If the vesting conditions are directly related to a capital asset then the charge is debited to the cost of the related asset.
Stobart Group Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Nonmarket vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each Consolidated Statement of Financial Position date so that ultimately the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of options that eventually vest.
Market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the options granted.
As long as all other vesting conditions are satisfied a charge is made irrespective of whether the market vesting conditions are satisfied.
The cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to achieve a market vesting condition.
At each Consolidated Statement of Financial Position date before vesting the cumulative expense is calculated representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and managements best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of nonmarket conditions and of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition be treated as vesting as described above.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous Statement of Financial Position date is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement with a corresponding entry in equity.
The Group has sharebased LongTerm Incentive Plans accounted for as set out above.
Leased Assets Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as tangible assets initially at fair value or if lower at the present value of the minimum lease payments and depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the lease term as detailed in the depreciation policy below.
The interest element of leasing payments represents a constant proportion of the capital balance outstanding and is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement over the period of the lease.
Where substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are not transferred to the Group an operating lease the total rentals payable under the lease are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straightline basis over the lease term.
The aggregate benefit of lease incentives is recognised as a reduction of the rental expense over the lease term on a straightline basis.
The land and buildings elements of property leases are considered separately for the purposes of lease classification.
Where the use of an asset is provided or obtained in exchange for payment consideration is given as to whether in substance this is a lease.
Externally Acquired Intangible Assets Excluding Goodwill Externally acquired intangible assets are initially recognised at cost and are subsequently amortised on a straightline basis over their useful lives.
The amortisation expense is included as amortisation of acquired intangibles and is included in non underlying items in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Intangible assets are recognised on business combinations if they are separable from the acquired entity or give rise to other contractuallegal rights.
The amounts ascribed to such intangibles are arrived at by using appropriate valuation techniques see section related to significant accounting estimates judgements and assumptions below.
The significant intangible assets recognised by the Group and their useful economic lives are as follows Intangible asset Useful life Brands Term of licence agreement or indefinite Customer contracts and related relationships Term of contract Where there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which a brand is expected to generate cash flows for the Group it will be considered to have an indefinite life.
Current Taxation Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position date.
Deferred Taxation Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position differs from its tax base except for differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting or taxable profit and investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the difference and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the difference can be utilised.
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilitiesassets are settledrecovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on either the same taxable Group Company and different Group entities which intend either to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or recovered.

Government Grants Government grants are recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attached conditions will be complied with.
Where the grant relates to an expense item it is recognised as income over the period necessary to match the grant on a systematic basis to the costs that it is intended to compensate.
Where the grant relates to an asset it is credited to deferred income and released to the Consolidated Income Statement to match the depreciation of the related asset.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable.
In the case of interim dividends to equity shareholders this is when paid.
In the case of final dividends this is when approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Property Plant and Equipment Freehold land and buildings and plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment in value.
Depreciation is provided on items of property plant and equipment other than land and assets under construction to write off to their residual value the carrying value of items over their expected useful lives.
Useful lives and residual values are reconsidered on an annual basis.
Depreciation is applied at the following rates Buildings 2% per annum straight line Modular buildings 3%10% per annum straight line Plant and machinery 10%20% per annum straight line Commercial vehicles and aircraft 5%33% per annum straight line Fixtures fittings and equipment 10%20% per annum straight line An item of property plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal.
Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset is included in profit or loss in the period the asset is derecognised.
Borrowing costs attributable to qualifying assets are capitalised.
Investment Properties Investment properties are measured initially at cost including transaction costs.
The carrying amount includes the cost of replacing part of an existing investment property at the time that the cost is incurred if the recognition criteria are met and excludes the cost of daytoday servicing of an investment property.
Subsequent to initial recognition investment properties are stated at fair value which reflects market conditions at the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position date.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair values of investment properties are included in the Consolidated Income Statement in the period in which they arise.
The fair value of the investment property portfolio is based on a valuation by an independent valuer who holds a recognised and relevant professional qualification and who has recent experience in the location and category of the investment property.
Investment properties acquired as part of a business combination are recognised initially at fair value and exclude transaction costs.
Investment properties are derecognised when either they have been disposed of or when the investment property is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected from its disposal.
Any gains or losses on the retirement or disposal of an investment property are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the period of retirement or disposal.
Investment properties are reclassified as held for sale assets from commencement of marketing for disposal provided that the Directors believe it is highly probably that they will be sold within a period of 12 months.
Rental income arising from operating leases on investment properties is spread on a straightline basis over the period of the lease.
Where an incentive such as a rentfree period is given to a tenant the carrying value of the investment property excludes any amount reported as a separate asset as a result of recognising rental income on this basis.
SelfConstructed Assets The cost of a selfconstructed asset is determined using the same principles as for an acquired asset.
Costs include any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
Costs include employee benefits site preparation delivery and handling installation and assembly testing and professional fees.
For assets made for sale or similar to those made for sale then the cost is the same as the cost of constructing an asset for sale including fixed and variable overheads which are considered directly attributable.
Internal net profits are eliminated in arriving at such costs.
Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost of inventories is based on the firstin firstout principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition.
In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress cost includes an appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating capacity.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Inventories include property assets which are held for development andor disposal to the extent that they are not Stobart Group Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2017 used in the Groups operations or held for investment purposes.
The net realisable value of these property inventory assets is determined by assessment of fair value less costs to sell using a similar method to that used in impairment workings.
NonCurrent Assets Held for Sale and Disposal Groups Noncurrent assets are classified as held for sale when they are available for immediate sale management is committed to a plan to sell it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn an active programme to locate a buyer has been initiated the asset or disposal group is being marketed at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and it is highly probable that a sale is expected to complete within 12 months from the date of classification or an extended period if the delay is caused by circumstances beyond the entitys control but the Group remains committed to the plan to sell the asset.
Noncurrent assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount immediately prior to being classified as held for sale in accordance with the Groups accounting policy and fair value less costs to sell.
Following their classification as held for sale noncurrent assets are not depreciated.
The results of operations disposed of during the prior year are included in the Consolidated Income Statement up to the date of disposal.
Associates
The Groups investments in its associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting unless the investment is classified as held for sale.
An associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence and which is neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture.
Under the equity method the equity investment in the associate is carried in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at cost plus postacquisition changes in the Groups share of net assets of the associate.
Goodwill relating to the associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is not amortised.
Loans to associates where the settlement is planned or expected to be repaid in the foreseeable future do not form part of the equity investment and are included in other receivables or noncurrent amounts owed by associates and joint ventures according to the expected repayment terms.
The
Consolidated Income Statement reflects the share of the results of operations of the associate but the loss is limited to the equity investment made plus any loans which form part of the net investment in the associate unless the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Where there has been a change recognised directly in the equity of the associate the Group recognises its share of any changes and discloses this when applicable in the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Other Comprehensive
The Groups share of profits and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associate are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate.
After application of the equity method the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise an additional impairment loss on the Groups investment in its associates.
The Group determines at each Consolidated Statement of Financial Position date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired.
If this is the case and there is a resulting impairment the amount is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Joint Ventures Investments in joint ventures which are jointly controlled entities are included in the financial statements using the equity method of accounting unless the investment is classified as held for sale.
Under the equity method the equity interest in the joint venture is initially recorded at cost and adjusted thereafter for the post acquisition change in the Groups share of net assets of the joint venture but any loss is limited to the equity investment made unless the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture.
Goodwill relating to the joint venture is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is not amortised.

2 Summary of Significant Accounting Judgements and
The Group makes judgements and estimates in preparing the financial statements.
Judgements and estimates are continually evaluated based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
In the future actual experience may differ from these judgements and estimates.
The judgements and estimates that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Judgements a Treatment of Brand Licence The accounting treatment of the licence of certain trademarks and designs to an external party is based on judgements over who bears the risk and rewards of ownership and assessments of the likelihood of options under the licence being taken.
Cl a ssific a t i on of Assoc i a t es J o in t V en t ures and
The key factor in determining the classification of associates joint ventures and investments is the timing and level of control.
During the year the Group acquired two investments previously recognised as an associate and joint venture as disclosed in note 4 on page 93.
Significant judgement was exercised to determine the date control was obtained.
Estimates a Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets The Group is required to test on an annual basis whether goodwill and intangible assets have suffered any impairment.
The recoverable amount is determined based on value in use or fair value less costs of disposal calculations.
The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows and discount rates in order to calculate the present value of the cash flows.
Intangible assets subject to these judgements include brand assets some of which are licensed to third parties and assessments of their values include judgements and estimates over whether the licence agreement will be extended or the asset purchased by the licensor.
Actual outcomes may vary.
Further information including carrying values is set out in note 16 on page 102.
Where there is an indication that an asset may be impaired the Group is required to test whether assets have suffered any impairment.
The recoverable amount is determined based on value in use or fair value less costs of disposal calculations.
The use of these methods requires the estimation of future cash flows and discount rates in order to calculate the present value of the cash flows.
Actual outcomes may vary.
Further information including carrying values and impairment charges during the year is set out in note 13 on page 98.
In v est men t P ro per t y V a lu a t i ons and Cl a ssific a t i ons The determined fair value of the investment properties is in accordance with independent valuations.
The fair value is most sensitive to the estimated yield as well as longterm vacancy rate.
Investment properties are reclassified as held for sale assets from commencement of marketing for disposal.
Estimation is required to assess the likelihood that a property will be sold within a period of 12 months.
The valuation of investment property in the current year is not considered to be a material estimate as there is only one investment property remaining in comparison to three in the prior year.
De t ermin a t i on of F air V a lues of In t angi ble Asse t s Ac quired in Business Combinations and in Respect of Investments in Assoc i a t es and J o in t V en t ures Determining the existence and the fair value of intangible assets on business combinations and in investments in associates and joint ventures involves judgements and estimates.
Estimates include determining future cash flows and discount rates.
See notes 4 and 14 for further disclosure.
V a lu a t i on of pro per t y in v en to r ies The Group is required to review on an annual basis whether the property inventories carrying values can be recovered.
If
The net realisable values of properties are based on certain estimates.
Estimates include the ability to obtain the appropriate planning permission the customer demand for usage of the type of properties that could be developed the build costs and the price of sale of the developed properties to a customer or of the undeveloped land to a developer.
See note 17 for further disclosure.

4 Business Combinations Acquisition of Propius Holdings Limited On 24 February 2017 the Group acquired the remaining 33.3% of the ordinary shares in Propius Holdings Limited Propius.
Propius is registered in the Cayman Islands.
The principal activity of Propius is aircraft leasing.
Together with the existing 66.7% already owned by the Group prior to the acquisition this gave the Group control over Propius.
Control was only deemed to be obtained on 24 February 2017 due to the existence of a previously held shareholder agreement.
The primary reason for the acquisition was to give the Group more control over its ability to grow and develop its aviation operations across the UK Ireland and Europe.
The provisional fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of Propius as at the date of acquisition are as follows
Book value Property plant and equipment 100135 100135 Trade and other receivables 933 933 Cash and cash equivalents 14406 14406 Loans and borrowings 70742 66797 Trade and other payables 818 818 Maintenance deposits  11704 Deferred tax liabilities 2651 1691 Net identifiable assets and liabilities 41263 34464 Consideration paid Cash 11763 Fair value of existing equity interest 28149 Total consideration 39912 Excess of fair value of net assets over consideration 1351 The consideration comprised cash of 11763000 and the existing owned proportion of the fair value of the net assets at acquisition date of 28149000.
There was no contingent consideration as defined in IFRS 3 Business Combinations in connection with this acquisition.
The Group incurred acquisition related transaction costs of 1402000.
These costs have been included in nonunderlying other operating expenses in the Groups Consolidated Income Statement.
Immediately prior to this acquisition the Group owned 66.7% of Propius which was disclosed as an equity accounted joint venture with a carrying value of 22771000.
The difference of 5378000 between this carrying value of 22771000 and the existing owned proportion of the net assets at acquisition date of 28149000 has been recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement within impairment of goodwill credit for business purchase.
The excess of fair value of net assets over consideration of 1351000 has been taken to the Consolidated Income Statement and is disclosed within impairment of goodwillcredit for business purchase.
Due to fair value adjustments and the transaction being completed at a later date than the price being agreed net assets exceeded consideration.
In the four days to 28 February 2017 the subsidiary contributed net profit of 34000 to the consolidated loss for the year.
If the acquisition had occurred on the first day of the accounting period Group revenue would have been an estimated 12152000 higher before elimination of intragroup trading and net profit would have been an estimated 1811000 higher excluding share of profits already recognised in note 14.
Stobart Group Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Acquisition of Everdeal Holdings Limited On 8 February 2017 the Group acquired the remaining 19% of the ordinary shares in Everdeal Holdings Limited Everdeal.
Everdeal is registered in Ireland.
The principal activity of Everdeal is the operation of an airline.
Eight of the aircraft in the Everdeal fleet are leased from the group headed by Propius Holdings Limited.
Control was only deemed to be obtained on 8 February 2017 due to clauses within the Articles of Association.
The primary reason for the acquisition was to give the Group more control over its ability to grow and develop its aviation operations across the UK Ireland and Europe.
Although Everdeal had book value net liabilities of 26.9m on acquisition the Directors are satisfied that their future actions can have a positive impact on the financial position and performance of this business.
The acquisition had the following effect on the Groups assets and liabilities
Book value Property plant and equipment 1158 1158 Inventory 3066 3282 Trade and other receivables 6256 6256 Cash and cash equivalents 7188 7188 Loans and borrowings 7843 7843 Trade and other payables 27530 27530 Maintenance reserve liability 3728 6813 Deferred tax liabilities 386 Provisions 5992 2584 Net identifiable assets and liabilities 27811 26886 Consideration paid Cash 564 Fair value of existing equity interest Total consideration 564 Goodwill 28375 The consideration comprised cash of 564000 and the existing owned proportion of the fair value of the net assets at acquisition date of nil.
There was no contingent consideration as defined in IFRS 3 Business Combinations in connection with this acquisition.
The Group incurred acquisitionrelated transaction costs of 200000.
These costs have been included in non underlying other operating expenses in the Groups Consolidated Income Statement.
Immediately prior to this acquisition the Group owned 81% of Everdeal which was disclosed as an equity accounted associate with a carrying value of nil.
There was no resulting gain or loss taken to the income statement following remeasurement of this investment.
In the 20 days to 28 February 2017 the subsidiary contributed a net loss of 1064000 to the consolidated loss for the year.
If the acquisition had occurred on the first day of the accounting period Group revenue would have been an estimated 111364000 higher and net profit would have been an estimated 1177000 higher.
Following an impairment review during which the future forecasts of the business were reviewed the goodwill arising on acquisition was written off in full in the Consolidated Income Statement and disclosed within impairment of goodwillcredit for business purchase.

11 Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Parent by the weighted average number of ordinary 10p shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares adjusted for share options which have exercise prices below the average market price of shares during the period.
With the exception of share options issued under the employee SAYE scheme these options are antidilutive in the current and prior years and have not therefore been included in the calculation in accordance with IAS 33.

Impairment of Assets There were no impairment charges in the current or prior year.
Impairment Testing of Other Property Plant and Equipment Where No Charge for Impairment Has Been Recognised The London Southend Airport CGU comprises the business operations of the commercial airport and ancillary operations including a hotel and railway station.
Whilst there were no significant indicators at the year end that the CGU may be impaired the CGU has been tested for impairment as the business suffered a loss before tax in the year to 28 February 2017.
The Group estimated the value in use of the CGU and determined that no charge for impairment was necessary.
The pretax discount rate used in the value in use calculation was 12.9% 2016 11.5%.
The estimated value in use was based on estimates of the timing and extent of increases in the level of future passenger numbers income per passenger rental income and the discount rate.
The carrying value of property plant and equipment included in this CGU at 28 February 2017 was 140.2m 2016 149.4m.
The calculation of the value in use is most sensitive to the discount rate.
In order for the estimated recoverable amount of the CGU to be equal to the carrying amount the discount rate would need to be individually increased by 6.9 percentage points 2016 6.2 percentage points.
Other Disclosures in Relation to Property Plant and
Certain land and buildings were acquired through business acquisitions and were subject to independent valuations as part of the fair value exercise or were acquired during the year and accounted for at cost.
Bank borrowings are secured on the Groups freehold land and buildings.
Included in land and buildings at 28 February 2017 are assets under construction of 18896000 2016 10226000.
The current year assets relate to a new processing site at Tilbury and development at Carlisle Lake District Airport.

Impairment Testing of Goodwill and Intangible Assets with Indefinite Lives In accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets the Group has undertaken impairment testing for each CGU.
The key assumptions applied in respect of each CGU are set out below.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed at the individual CGU level in order to review the effect of changes in key assumptions.
Stobart Energy CashGenerating Unit During the year the previous Stobart Biomass Products and Stobart Biomass Transport CGUs were amalgamated into one Stobart Energy CGU.
The Directors determined that this more appropriately reflected the Energy business going forward following significant changes in the management structure.
The recoverable amount of the goodwill and intangible assets in the Stobart Energy CGU has been based on value in use calculations using projections from financial forecasts approved by senior management covering a five year 2016 five year period.
The main assumptions on which the forecasts were based include sales volumes and profit margins.
The pretax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections was 9.6% 2016 8.9% based on the weighted average cost of capital for the CGU taking into account the cost of equity and debt for the CGU and adjusting for risk specific to the CGU.
Cash flows beyond the five year period are deemed to be in perpetuity but an annual growth rate of 2.0% 2016 2.0% is assumed in the calculations.
No impairment losses have been recognised in the current or prior year.
The calculation of the value in use is most sensitive to the discount rate.
With regard to the assessment of value in the Stobart Biomass CGU management believes that no reasonably possible change in the discount rate would cause the carrying value of the CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.
Stobart Rail CashGenerating Unit The recoverable amount of the goodwill and intangible assets in the Stobart Rail CGU has been based on value in use calculations using projections from financial forecasts approved by senior management covering a five year 2016 five year period.
The main assumptions on which the forecasts were based include Network Rail work volumes.
The pretax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections was 11.6% 2016 9.8% based on the weighted average cost of capital for the CGU taking into account the cost of equity and debt for the CGU and adjusting for risk specific to the CGU.
Cash flows beyond the five year period are deemed to be in perpetuity but an annual growth rate of 2.0% 2016 2.0% is assumed in the calculations.

STATEMENTS
No impairment losses have been recognised in the current or the prior period.
The calculation of the value in use is most sensitive to the discount rate and sales volumes.
With regard to the assessment of value in the CGU management believes that no reasonably possible change in the discount rate or sales volumes would cause the carrying value of the CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.
Other
The brands with indefinite life in the other column in the table relate to Stobart brands for which the Group obtained an independent valuation in 2014 which supports these values.
This asset has been tested for impairment at the year end using a pretax discount rate of 10.2% 2016 6.2%.
No impairment losses have been recognised and in order for the estimated recoverable amount of the CGU to be equal to the carrying amounts the discount rate would need to be individually increased by 12.2 percentage points 2016 16.5 to 22.4% 2016 22.7% and management believes that no reasonably possible change in cash flows would cause the carrying value of the CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.
The balance of the brands of 34249000 2016 37966000 not included in the above table represents the value of expected receipts under the licence agreement with a trading subsidiary of Greenwhitestar Holding Company 1 Limited for the right to use the Eddie Stobart brand following the disposal of the Transport and Distribution business.
This is not included in the table above in the current year because this asset is not considered to have an indefinite life but instead will be amortised to a residual value over its useful economic life of six years three years of which are remaining at the year end.
The licence agreement allows a trading subsidiary of Greenwhitestar Holding Company 1 Limited to use certain Eddie Stobart trademarks and designs for an initial period of 15 years with options to extend the licence period terminate within four years or purchase the trademarks and designs for use in the logistics business or purchase the trademarks and designs for unlimited use.
The discount rates used in the impairment workings for most of the CGUs are higher than those used in the prior year.
The methods used to determine the factors within the discount rate calculations were consistent with the prior year.
Reasons for the increase in some of the discount rates include an increase in cost of debt the inclusion of a size premium and variations in gearing and beta values for comparative companies used to calculate cost of equity.
The Stobart Energy CGU is part of the Energy segment.
The
Stobart Rail CGU is part of the Rail segment and the Other CGU is part of the adjustments and eliminations segment.
17 Inventories Consumable supplies 3364 222 Goods held for resale 355 452 Property inventories 60009 44409 63728 45083 Property inventories include development land and buildings at Runcorn and Widnes with a total carrying value of 55.4million.
The net realisable values of these development assets are expected to be higher than the carrying values.
The net realisable value of these property inventories are based on certain estimates.
The assets are at different stages of development.
For the Widnes assets the estimates include the build costs and the price obtainable from customers for the developed land.
Development plans are expected to crystallise within the next one to two years.
For the Runcorn assets the plans are at an earlier stage and are expected to include a mixed use development.
The estimates include the ability to obtain appropriate planning permissions the price of development land the build costs and the customer demand for the developed assets.
These development plans are expected to progress over more than one year.
The Group is not yet committed to a firm plan for this development land.
Applying reasonable sensitivities to these development assets does not result in the net realisable value falling below the current carrying values.
The Group has a proven track record of achieving profitable returns on property developments but if the estimates are not met then it is possible there would be a material write down of the value of property inventories.
If the current plans do not crystallise the Group would seek alternative development options.

During the year the 50000000 variable rate committed revolving credit facility with a facility end date of January 2019 was amended to 65000000 and extended to an end date of January 2020.
This facility was drawn at 42200000 2016 27000000 at the year end.
The Group was in compliance with all financial covenants throughout both the current and prior year.
The book value and fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are as follows Book value Fair value Financial assets Cash 30653 30653 Amounts owed by associates and joint ventures 16956 16956 Trade receivables 24272 24272 Other receivables 297 297 Fuel swaps 540 540 Financial liabilities Trade payables 22804 22804 Loans and borrowings 112948 111705 Finance leases and hire purchase arrangements 38411 40098 Other payables 5536 5536 Fuel swaps 101 101 Book value Fair value Financial assets Cash 9858 9858 Amounts owed by associates and joint ventures 15339 15339 Trade receivables 24167 24167 Other receivables 638 638 Financial liabilities Trade payables 17568 17568 Loans and borrowings 26382 26382 Finance leases and hire purchase arrangements 31468 30124 Diesel swap 1381 1381 For trade and other receivablespayables with a remaining life of less than one year the carrying amount is considered to reflect the fair value.
The fair values of loans and borrowings have been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The fair value of finance leases and hire purchase arrangements and of loans and borrowings are classified as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
Fair Value Hierarchy The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique Level 1 quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value As at 28 February 2017
Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Financial assets Fuel swaps 439  439 As at 29 February 2016
Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Financial liabilities Diesel swap 1381  1381 Investment Properties In addition to the financial assets disclosed above investment properties are also measured at fair value.
All of the Groups investment properties were subject to an independent valuation as at 28 February 2017 by GVA Grimley on the basis of open market value supported by market evidence.
The open market value represents the amount at which the assets could be exchanged between a knowledgeable willing buyer and a knowledgeable willing seller in an arms length transaction at the date of the valuation.
The valuation was performed in accordance with the RICS Valuation Standards issued by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and is based on available market evidence and therefore falls within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
The significant unobservable inputs in the fair value calculations are the future rentals and the related yields 5.0% 9.5% 2016 5.0%9.5% void period 03 years 2016 03 years and rentfree period 01 year 2016 01 year.
Assets Classified as Held for Sale Both property assets classified as held for sale at the year end were previously classified as investment properties.
They were subject to the above valuations prior to transfer and fall within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
Fair Value Calculation Methodology Fuel swaps are valued based on market rates and market accepted models.
Fair value for financial instruments held at amortised cost has been estimated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
During the current and prior year there were no transfers between level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements and no transfers into and out of level 3 fair value measurements.

Financial Instruments  Risk Management
The Group is exposed through its operations to the following financial risks Credit risk  Fair value or cash flow interest rate risk Liquidity risk  Capital risk Diesel price risk  Jet fuel price risk In common with all other businesses the Group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial instruments.
This note describes the Groups objectives policies and processes for managing those risks and the methods used to measure them.
Principal Financial Instruments The principal financial instruments used by the Group from which financial instrument risk arises are as follows Trade and other receivables  Cash at bank Bank overdrafts  Trade and other payables Floatingrate bank loans  Finance leases General Objectives Policies and Processes The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Groups risk management objectives and policies.
The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the Groups competitiveness and flexibility.
Further details regarding these policies are set out below Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
The Group is mainly exposed to credit risk from credit sales.
It is Group policy implemented locally to assess the credit risk of new customers before entering contracts.
Such credit ratings are taken into account by local business practices.
All credit sales are made under Group payment and delivery terms and conditions and are mostly covered by insurance.
All credit limits are formally set and are in agreement with the bank.
The recoverability of the net trade and other receivables book is considered highly likely.
This is supported by the history of collection by the Group.
Interest Rate Risk The Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk from longterm borrowings and cash at variable rates.
There are loan facilities at variable rates as well as amounts held on deposit.
These borrowing policies are managed centrally.
Although the Board accepts that this policy neither protects the Group entirely from the risk of paying rates in excess of current market rates nor eliminates fully cash flow risk associated with variability in interest payments it considers that it achieves an appropriate balance of exposure to these risks.
During the current and prior year the Groups borrowings at variable rate were denominated in GBP .
During the current year the Groups borrowings at fixed rate were denominated in USD.
Diesel Price Risk The Group is exposed to diesel price risk as diesel fuel is a key supply to the transport fleet of vehicles in the Energy business.
If diesel prices rise there will be increases in the base costs that cannot be fully passed on to customers.
In order to mitigate this risk the Group has taken out diesel swap contracts to manage its exposure.
The fair value of diesel swap contracts falling within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as at 28 February 2017 is 540000 asset 2016 1381000 liability and the gross swap coverage was 2053000 2016 5283000.
The fair value of the swap is calculated by Investec Bank Commercial Markets based on midmarket levels as of the close of business on 28 February 2017.
Jet Fuel Price Risk The Group is exposed to jet fuel price risk as jet fuel is a key supply to the fleet of aeroplanes in the Aviation business.
If
In order to mitigate this risk the Group has taken out jet fuel swap contracts to manage its exposure.
The fair value of jet fuel swap contracts falling within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as at 28 February 2017 is 101000 liability 2016 nil and the gross swap coverage was 6570000 2016 nil.
The fair value of the swaps is calculated by Mitsui Bussan Commodities Ltd based on midmarket levels as of the close of business on 28 February 2017.
Sensitivity Analysis The sensitivity analysis set out below summarises the sensitivity of the market value of financial instruments to hypothetical changes in market rates and prices.
Sensitivity is calculated based on all other variables remaining constant.
The interest rate analysis assumes a 1% change in interest rates.
The diesel and jet fuel price sensitivity analysis is based on diesel and jet fuel related derivative instruments held at the end of each reporting period.
The impact of a 1% increase in interest rates and a 10% increase in the diesel and jet fuel price is disclosed.
A corresponding decrease results in an equal and opposite impact on the Consolidated Income Statement.

The Group monitors capital using gearing ratios.
Gearing excluding net debt in disposal groups based on net debt divided by capital was 31.0% at 28 February 2017 2016 11.6%.
The Group includes the following within borrowings bank loans and overdrafts finance leases and hire purchase contracts and loan notes.
Capital comprises equity attributable to the equity holders of the Parent.
The Group uses share capital to partly fund major acquisitions where considered appropriate.
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital restraints except compliance with normal bank covenants.
Dividends are payable after considering the solvency of the Group and the forecast funding requirements and headroom.
Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk arises from the Groups management of working capital and the finance charges and principal repayments on its debt instruments.
It is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
See also the maturity profile of loans and borrowings below.
The Group prepares and reviews rolling weekly cash flow projections.
Actual cash and debt positions along with available facilities and headroom are reported weekly.
These are monitored by Group management.
In addition full annual five year forecasts are prepared including cash flow and headroom forecasts.
These are full detailed forecasts prepared by each division and consolidated for the
The financial statements have been prepared using the going concern basis as the financial forecasts support the assumption that the Group will be able to meet its obligations when they fall due.

The latest actuarial valuation of the Ansa plan was as at 31 December 2013 and was carried out by an independent qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
At the date of the latest actuarial valuation the realisable value of assets was 20291000 which was sufficient to cover 82% of the value of benefits that had accrued to members measured on the continuing basis.
Total contributions payable for the year to 28 February 2017 amounted to 608000 2016 614000 with no contributions due to the plan at 28 February 2017 2016 nil.
The Scheme is established under trust law and has a corporate trustee that is required to run the Scheme in accordance with the Schemes Trust deed and rules and to comply with all the relevant legislation.
Responsibility for governance of the Scheme lies with the Trustee.
The Trustee is a company whose directors comprise representatives of the Group and the Scheme participants in accordance with its Articles of Association and UK pension law.
The principal assumptions for the purpose of the actuarial valuations used in these Consolidated Financial Statements were as follows 2017 2016 Discount rate for scheme liabilities 2.55% 3.85% Rate of inflation RPI 3.60% 3.20% Rate of inflation CPI 2.60% 2.20% Rate of general increase in salaries 3.60% 3.20% Mortality table used S2PA

An improvement means the decrease in the rate of mortality at a given age over the time period.
Sensitivities to Principal Assumptions The principal risk to the Group in relation to the plan is that the Group would be required to fund any deficits in the plan the level of which is variable and depends upon mortality rates inflation and returns on plan assets.
The most significant sensitivity stems from the following assumptions Discount rate.
This is a key assumption because it is applied to the future pension payments.
Price inflation.
This is a key assumption because it is used to determine increases to pensions in payment and in deferment and increases to pensionable salaries for the one active member.
Mortality after retirement.
This is a key assumption because it determines how long pensions are paid for when they come into payment.
The central assumptions are the S2PA base tables with the CMI2015 projections of future experience subject to a 1.0% p. improvement with no age rating.
Sensitising the assumptions listed above would have the following effects on the total liabilities assets and deficit positions.
For the purposes of the mortality sensitivity illustrations we have varied the minimum annual improvement.
