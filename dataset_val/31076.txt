Chairmans Statement
Dear Shareholder During 2017 conditions for the oil and gas industry worldwide and for Russia generally have been more stable than in the recent past.
This stability has enabled Volga Gas to undertake important steps to enhance its operations materially the most important of which was switching the gas sweetening process utilised at the Dobrinskoye gas processing plant the Groups principal production facility to a Redoxbased system.
This has reduced the chemical costs of the operation and has eliminated the need to dispose of bulky spent processing chemicals.
During the implementation of this process and whilst the operational team optimises the management of the new process the plant throughput has had to be reduced.
However with the improved oil and gas market conditions this has not had as material an impact on the Groups revenues in 2017 as may otherwise have occurred.
The change to a Redox gas sweetening process was achieved with only modest capital expenditure as minimal modifications to the existing plant were required.
During 2017  the main focus of the capital investment was in two projects that are expected to provide incremental revenues material impact in reducing the operating profits of the Group to US0.1 million 2016 US2.51 million due to an increase in the depletion charge to US8.6 million 2016 US5.0 million.
Further details of the impact of the reduction of the reserves are set out in the operating and financial reviews between pages 6 and 11.
In spite of the reduction in reserves the Group still holds significant fully developed reserves in its three principal fields.
These reserves form the basis of sustainable production with growth potential in the near term.
These assets provide a platform for the Group to grow in the future through successful exploration and by selective valueaccretive acquisitions.
The Board believes that Volga Gas has a stable foundation and the financial and operational capability to develop and extend these assets to provide long term value for our shareholders.
The Board remains committed to a policy of enhanced dividend distribution and is planning to modify its dividend policy towards higher rates of distribution having in mind the requirements of the business and the need to maintain its financial strength.
Within these constraints the Board would consider distributing up to 75% of its free cash flow as dividends.
For the time being however the Board considers it prudent to defer a decision on the dividend level until the incremental cash flow from the investments undertaken in 2017 begins to be realised.
A further decision will be taken by the interim results stage in September 2018.
While the immediate outlook for the oil industry remains broadly positive the finances of the Group will continue to be conservatively managed.
Capital investment commitments will continue to be at a modest rate and focused on enhancing the profits from the gas and condensate production and on optimising the production from the reserves of the Company.

LPG  propane and butane  that are currently vented and flared and the drilling of a new horizontal oil well to access the hitherto undeveloped reserves in the Uzen oil field located in the Groups Karpenskiy licence area.
The LPG project is expected to commence producing and selling product from April 2018.
When it is fully operational the LPG plant could add up to 400 barrels of oil equivalent per day of incremental sales volumes.
These projects are discussed in greater detail by the Chief Executive Officer in the Operational Review.
Given the constraints to gas and condensate production experienced in 2017  the Board is pleased to report that revenues have been broadly maintained at US37.1 million 2016 US39.4 million EBITDA at US8.8 million 2016 US9.6 million and operating cash flow before working capital movements at US9.0 million 2016 US10.4 million.
This has enabled the Group to undertake an increased capital expenditure programme during 2017 and in spite of some overruns in the costs of the Uzen horizontal well to end the year with healthy cash balances and remain in a positive net cash position after taking into account borrowings.
This is in addition to paying US5.0 million in dividends to shareholders in 2017 2016 nil.
Unfortunately Volga Gas has recently experienced higher formation water content at certain production wells at Vostochny Makarovskoye VM and so the Board thought it appropriate to commission an updated independent reserves report and prudent to adopt its findings in full.
This report dated 12 April 2018 has resulted in a 27% reduction in the proved reserves and a 28% reduction in the proved and probable reserves of oil gas and condensate and we are actively looking into technical and operational solutions to mitigate the impact of the reserves reduction.
The reserves reduction is caused by a recalculation of recovery rates from the VM and Dobrinskoye gas fields rather than any changes to the geological model or estimates of original hydrocarbons in place.

Chief Executives Report
The principal objective for Volga Gas in 2017 was to effect a transformation in the technology used to process the gas and condensate at the Dobrinskoye gas plant from which the Group derives the overwhelming majority of its production revenue and profits.
During 2016 and early 2017  after extensive investigations and pilot tests management concluded that a switch to Redoxbased sweetening would be most advantageous  not only for reduced cost but also for the elimination of waste material that required disposal.
This also had the advantage that it could be implemented with minimal modifications to the existing plant saving significantly on capital expenditure that other alternatives would require.
In May 2017  we commenced the switch to Redox processing and from June 2017 onwards all of the gas processed at Dobrinskoye was with Redox.
Although the change was achieved at low capital cost in the first months after implementation the plant throughput was kept at low levels while the process management was optimised.
Throughput at the gas plant was gradually increased and in December 2017 was averaged 533000 m per day 18.8 mmcfd.
However the period of lower throughput at the gas plant was primarily responsible for an overall reduction in Group production being 24% lower than 2016.
Offsetting the reduction in volumes in 2017  oil prices and the Russian Ruble both recovered steadily through the year and consequently the impact of lower sales 2018 objectives and mediumterm strategy Management has the following key objectives in 2018 To increase the efficiency and processing capacity at the gas plant using Redox gas sweetening from the rate of 533000 m per day achieved at the end of 2017.
Having nearly completed construction of the LPG plant to commence production and optimise the marketing of the product.
To complete the reservoir and technical studies on the VM field and to commence actions including workovers and reperforations of the well bores to mitigate future formation water production thereby restoring maximum gas production and the extraction of reserves in place.
Optimise the production of oil from the new horizontal well Uzen 101 and to manage the more mature oil wells in the field.
Current trading and outlook Between January and March 2018 Group production averaged 4084 barrels of oil equivalent per day in line with managements plan given the anticipated higher levels of planned maintenance downtime in the period.
For the coming months management expects to maintain an average daily production of gas and condensate in the region of 3800 boepd resulting in Group production of approximately 4500 boepd excluding incremental volumes from the LPG project which when the project is fully operational is expected to add a further 400 boepd.
International oil prices strengthened at the start of 2018 and have remained relatively stable.
Although it is a minor part of the Groups output oil production has increased as a result of additional volumes from the horizontal well Uzen 101 which has more than offset the natural decline in the mature oil wells.
In the current environment and at current production rates to which may be added additional sales of LPG management expects the Groups financial performance in 2018 to improve on that of 2017.
Meanwhile new capital expenditure commitments remain within projected cash generation permitting a resumption of a sustainable distribution policy for shareholders.

This is discussed in greater detail in the Financial Review.
In addition to the switch to Redox gas sweetening the two major projects undertaken by Volga Gas during 2017 were the construction of an LPG unit at Dobrinskoye and the drilling of the horizontal well Uzen 101 on the Uzen oil field in our Karpenskiy licence.
These projects were the main use of the capital investment undertaken by Volga Gas in 2017 and are expected to contribute materially to future revenues and profits.
I will cover these projects in greater detail below.
Reserves update Subsequent to the 2017 year end the Company commissioned a new independent reserve report by OOO Geostream Assets Management Geostream as late in 2017 the presence of increased formation water was observed during gas production from certain of the production wells on the VM field.
The report dated 12 April 2018 has resulted in a reduction of 27% in the proved and of 28% in the proved plus probable reserve numbers for the Groups oil and gas reserves.
Although the estimate of original hydrocarbons in place is unchanged the presence of formation water during gas production has led Geostream to apply a more conservative calculation of ultimately recoverable reserves from the VM field.
Management considers the new reserve estimates to be consistent with the currently available field data and accordingly has adopted the revised reserve estimates as the Groups oil gas and condensate reserves for the 2017 yearend accounts.
The
Groups reserve statement is shown in the Operational Review on page 9.
The impact of the reserve revision has been to increase the depletion depreciation and amortisation charge of the Group compared to 2016 with consequent reductions in the profit and net book value of the Groups assets.
While the reserve revisions have not triggered any impairment charges subsequent reserve evaluations may or may not lead to further revisions which may impair the assets.
Following the revised reserve estimates that have been adopted we are actively looking into technical and operational solutions to mitigate the impact of the reserves reductions and to maximise gas production through the Dobrinskoye gas plant.
06 Volga Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Operational Review Operations overview Operations overview As outlined on the previous page Group production in 2017  at an average daily rate of 4948 boepd was 24% lower than the 6507 boepd achieved in 2016.
The principal reason for this was the planned reduction of gas processing plant throughput necessary as the Redoxbased gas sweetening process was implemented and optimised over a period of several months.
There was also some decline in the mature production wells in the Uzen oil field and the increased presence of formation water in certain of the production wells at VM in late 2017.
The impact on revenues was partly offset by a continued recovery in oil prices through the year and the Ruble stabilising at higher levels.
As a result of the lower proportion of export sales in 2017  taking into account selling expenses netback revenues defined as revenues less selling expenses as shown in the income statements in 2017 were US34.8 million only marginally lower than the US35.4 million in 2016.
The benefits of savings from the lower process chemicals costs were offset by higher rates of Mineral Extraction Tax arising from higher oil prices and the scheduled adjustments to the rate formulas and by increases in administrative expenses.
As a consequence EBITDA for 2017 was US8.8 million 2016 US9.6 million.
Besides the implementation of Redoxbased processing at the Dobrinskoye gas plant the key operational activities in 2017 were construction of the LPG plant and in the separate oil production business the drilling of new horizontal wells on the Uzen field.

Gascondensate production The Dobrinskoye and VM fields are managed as a single business unit.
Production from the fields is processed at the gas plant located next to the Dobrinskoye field extracting the condensate and processing the gas to pipeline standards before input into Gazproms regional pipeline system via an inlet located at the plant.
The VM field was developed with wells drilled by Volga Gas while the Dobrinskoye wells were acquired from previous licensees.
By the end of 2016 development drilling on the VM field was essentially completed with a total of four wells in the principal reservoir the Evlano Livinskiy carbonate and a further well in the secondary Bobrikovskiy sandstone reservoir.
Production during 2017 averaged 19.1 mmcfd of gas and 1163 bpd of condensate 2016 25.5 mmcfd of gas and 1557 bpd condensate an overall decrease of 25% in equivalent barrels of oil terms.
As outlined above this was principally a result of the decision to operate the gas processing plant at lower throughput rates as the Redox processing was implemented and optimised.
Between June 2017 and December 2017  the daily throughput increased steadily as discussed below and production increased accordingly.
Between January and April 2017  while the gas was being sweetened with the old Sulfanox process production was generally running at close to the gas plants maximum physical capacity and averaged 30.5 mmcfd of gas and 1730 bpd of condensate.
However during late 2017 and early 2018 the presence of formation water in certain of the production wells on VM was detected.
Consequently management commissioned a new reserve report.
The report date 12 April 2018 concluded that as a result of more conservative calculation of ultimate recovery rates the Company should recognise a significant reduction in reserves mainly in the VM field.
Management is looking into technical and operational solutions to mitigate the impact of the reserves reductions including conducting well interventions on the VM field workovers and reperforations of the well bores.
On Dobrinskoye which is a more mature gas field there are also plans to drill a sidetrack on well 26 to develop a likely undepleted portion of the reservoir.
The proven and Probable reserves and the revisions adopted in full for the 2017 yearend results are detailed in the table on page 9.
Gascondensate sales Historically the Groups gas was sold to Trans Nafta under contract at a fixed Ruble contract.
However from December 2016 gas sales have been made directly to Gazprom.
This has resulted in an increase in the net realisations although the Group now pays a transit tariff for delivery via the Gazprom pipeline network to the point of sale.
In US Dollar terms however the stronger Ruble as well as an increase in the Ruble selling price led to the average gas sales realisations rising 36% in 2017 to US2.06mcf 2016 US1.51.
Since November 2015 we have been utilising export channels for condensate as an alternative to domestic sales in periods of low domestic demand.
Domestic market conditions in 2017 were generally more favourable and consequently condensate exports declined significantly and ceased altogether from the end of March 2017.
In total approximately 15% of condensate sales were exported during 2017  compared to 48% of the total condensate sales in 2016.
During 2017  the average condensate netback price after accounting for export taxes and transportation costs increased 38% to US34.37 per barrel 2016 US24.83.
Average unit production costs on the gas condensate fields increased moderately to US5.39 per boe in 2017 2016 US5.33.
The recovery in the Ruble in which effectively all the costs are denominated and the lower throughput rates in the second half of 2017 increased the impact of the fixed cost element of the operating expenses and offset the benefits of lower chemical costs associated with the switch to Redox.
08 Volga Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Gas processing plant The Dobrinskoye gas processing plant was originally designed and constructed to utilise a Sulfanoxbased gas sweetening process which had the benefit of low capital cost but carried high chemical usage and generated substantial volumes of waste requiring careful disposal.
The plant was designed with a maximum throughput capacity of one million m day 35.3 mmcfd.
During 2016 a number of alternatives were tested and by the end of 2016 management decided that a switch to a Redoxbased sweetening process would be optimal and required only minor modifications to the existing plant equipment.
Between April and June 2017  industrialscale testing of the Redox process was undertaken while the modifications were carried out.
In June the plant was switched over entirely to Redoxbased processing.
During the initial months of the new process between June 2017 and August 2017  the plant throughput was kept at relatively low levels as the process management was optimised.
Throughput increased gradually through the remainder of 2017  from the average rate of 213000 m day 7.5 mmcfd in June 2017 to reach 533000 m day 18.8 mmcfd in December 2017  slightly above managements shortterm throughput target.
In addition during November 2017 inefficient operations of the system pumps had caused up to 40% of the processed gas being below pipeline specification.
This issue has been dealt with and since December 2017 all of the processed gas is available for sale.
Based on the experience of operating the Redox process to date management identified the need to add two further oxidising vessels to the current plant configuration.
Having recently completed this management expects improvements in efficiency reduced operational downtime and higher effective operating capacity.
The other key development at the gas plant in 2017 was the construction of a new unit for the capture storage and sale of
LPGs primarily comprising propane and butane are currently either included in the sales gas stream or flared.
The LPG project will provide an additional product stream which is expected to increase total sales volumes by approximately 400 boepd and to enhance profitability.
Although construction was largely accomplished before the end of 2017 as planned due to delays in delivery of certain items of equipment and to regulatory clearance completion of the project was delayed by approximately three months.
As of March 2018 the LPG project is commencing the commissioning process and should start production during the second quarter of 2018.
In spite of the delays to the project the LPG project is expected to be completed at a total capital cost of US5.5 million.
Oil production and development Since 2009 the Uzen field has been producing oil from a cretaceous Aptian reservoir at a depth of approximately 1000 metres.
As the oil was produced the oil water contact in the reservoir rose and the wells at the edge of the field were shut in as water cut increased.
By the start of 2017 production was derived from three active wells  down from a peak of five in 2010.
With careful management production has been continued albeit at declining rates.
The existing mature wells produced at an average rate of 595 bopd in 2017 2016 708 bopd.
The principal development activity of 2017 on the Uzen field was on the proved undeveloped reserves in the shallower Albian reservoir using a horizontal well.
Drilling of the new horizontal well 101 commenced on 27 April 2017.
Although mainly being drilled to develop the proved but currently undeveloped Albian reservoir in the Uzen field the well was initially sidetracked to investigate potential unproven structures.
While one possible target was dry a second small oil accumulation was encountered providing only a minor increment to Group reserves.
Drilling operations on the horizontal section of well 101 were concluded as anticipated in July 2017  having completed a horizontal section of total length of 627 metres.
Logging while drilling indicated a total productive zone in the well of 506 metres exhibiting average porosity of 32% and oil saturation of 68%.
Between
October and December 2017  well 101 was intermittently flow tested.
Following the installation of a flow line from the well site to the main Uzen field facilities in December 2017  well 101 has been put on continuous production.
Between January and March 2018 well 101 has been producing at an average rate of approximately 300 bopd.
As a result of the extra sidetracks drilled and additional precautions taken to deliver a stable and secure production well the costs of drilling well 101 increased to approximately US7.1 million compared to a budget cost of US3.8 million.
Following a revised conversion from tonnes to barrels as the oil contained in the Albian reservoir has slightly higher density than the oil in the Aptian reservoir there is a modest restatement in the Uzen oil reserves as expressed in barrels.
There is no change in the tonnage of reserves.
Exploration
During 2017  as a result of the decision to focus on incomegenerating investments exploration activity was confined to internal technical studies.
Nevertheless the Group has identified a number of exploration targets in the Karpenskiy Licence Area at shallow horizons of between 1000 and 2000 metres depth.
These provide lowcost opportunities to add potentially material oil reserves.
While management recognises the potential of these prospects the immediate priority is to maximise the value and cash generation from proven reserves.
The Group has fulfilled all its licence commitments on the Karpenskiy Licence Area and further drilling in the area is discretionary.
Nevertheless future development of the oil potential in the Groups licences is a key element of managements mediumterm strategy.

Oil gas and condensate reserves as of 1 January 2018 In February 2018 Volga Gas commissioned an updated reserve report of the Groups oil gas and condensate reserves.
Management considers the new reserve estimates contained in this report dated 12 April 2018 to be a reasonable reflection of the field data currently available and accordingly they have been adopted by the Company as a fair statement of reserves.

Volga Gas through its wholly owned subsidiaries PGK and GNS is the operator and has a 100% interest in four licences to explore for and produce oil gas and condensate in the Volga region.
The reserve estimates as at 31 December 2016 were independently assessed by OOO Geostream Assets Management.
The estimates at 31 December 2017 are results of an updated study conducted by OOO Geostream Assets Management dated 12 April 2018.
The full reserve report is available on the Companys website site The reserve estimates were prepared in metric units tonnes for oil condensate and LPG and standard cubic metres for gas.
The conversion ratios from tonnes to barrels applied in the table above were 7.833 barrels per tonne of oil 8.75 barrels per tonne of condensate and 11.75 barrels per tonne of LPG.
One cubic metre equates to 35.3 cubic feet and one barrel of oil equivalent is given by 6000 standard cubic feet of gas.
The above reserve estimates prepared in accordance with the PMRS reserve definitions prepared by the Oil and Gas Reserves Committee of the SPE have been reviewed and verified by Mr Andrey Zozulya Director and Chief Executive Officer of Volga Gas plc for the purposes of the Guidance Note for Mining Oil and Gas companies issued by the London Stock Exchange in June 2009.

Financial Review
Results for the year In 2017  the Group generated US37.1 million in turnover 2016 US39.4 million from the sale of 644506 barrels of crude oil and condensate 2016 837 837 barrels and 6378 million cubic feet of natural gas 2016 9210 million cubic feet.
The average price realised for liquids sold in the domestic market was the equivalent of US35.49 per barrel 2016 US30.59 per barrel.
During 2017  approximately 15% of condensate sales were to export customers 2016 48%.
As a consequence selling expenses such as export taxes and transportation costs fell substantially in 2017 to US2.2 million 2016 US 4.1 million.
For domestic sales the selling price for liquids is effectively a wellhead netback price.
The average netback price for liquids sales calculated by deducting selling expenses from revenue attributed to oil and condensate sales in 2017 was US35.80 2016 US25.70.
The gas sales price during 2017 averaged US2.06 per thousand cubic feet 2016 US1.51 per thousand cubic feet the increase being attributable to higher Ruble selling prices as well as the movement in the RubleUS Dollar exchange rate.
The average sales price of gas in Rubles increased in 2017 by 10.8% compared to 2016 no increase in 2016 over 2015.
In December 2016 the Company commenced sales directly to Gazprom which was partly responsible for the increase in realised price.
Production activities generated a gross profit of US8.2 million in 2017 2016 US13.1 million.
In 2017  the total cost of production decreased to US9.3 million 2016 US11.0 million with variable costs driven by lower production volumes some Ruble inflation and the effect of the recovery in the Ruble on our predominantly Rubledenominated costs.
Unit field operating costs were steady at US3.74 per boe 2016 US3.95 per boe partly as a result of cost efficiencies offset by fixed costs shared among lower volumes.
Productionbased taxes were US10.9 million 2016 US10.3 million reflecting the impact of higher oil prices and Ruble exchange rates on Mineral Extraction Tax MET rates as well as the impact of further formula changes that came into effect on 1 January 2017.
This was partly offset by lower production volumes.
MET paid in 2017 represented 31.4% of netback revenues 2016 29.0% of netback revenues.
Operating and administrative expenses in 2017 were US5.8 million 2016 US4.5 million reflecting the stronger Ruble as well as certain oneoff expenses.
The Group experienced a 9% reduction in EBITDA defined in the operational and financial summary on page 12 as operating profit before noncash charges including exploration expenses depletion and depreciation to US8.8 million 2016 US9.6 million.
The unit rate of Depletion Depreciation and Amortisation DDandA increased to US5.02 per boe 2016 US2.12 per boe as a result of both the reduction in reserves in the VM and Dobrinskoye fields and higher than anticipated expenditures on the Uzen horizontal well as well as the strength of the Ruble in which the depletion pool is recorded.
This was offset by the 24% decrease in production.

In 2017 the Company paid a dividend of US0.007 per ordinary share in respect of 2016 and in addition a special dividend of US0.055 per ordinary share.
In light of the significant capital investment in 2017 and in the interests of prudence the Board will defer any decision on further distribution until the interim results stage when the impact of the new projects on financial performance will be clearer.
However the Board is considering a policy of basing future dividends on cash generation as well as earnings and subject to the requirements of the Group of distributing up to 75% of free cash flow.

Principal Risks and Uncertainties The Group is subject to various risks relating to political economic legal social industry business and financial conditions.
The following risk factors which are not exhaustive are particularly relevant to the Groups business activities Volatility of oil prices The supply demand and prices for oil are influenced by factors beyond the Groups control.
These factors include global and regional demand and supply exchange rates interest and inflation rates and political events.
A significant prolonged decline in oil and gas prices could impact the profitability of the Groups activities.
All of the Groups revenues and cash flows come from the sale of oil gas and condensate.
If sales prices should fall below and remain below the Groups cost of production for any sustained period the Group may experience losses and may be forced to curtail or suspend some or all of the Groups production at the time such conditions exist.
In addition the Group would also have to assess the economic impact of low oil and gas prices on its ability to recover any losses the Group may incur during that period and on the Groups ability to maintain adequate reserves.
The Group does not currently hedge its crude oil production to reduce its exposure to oil price volatility as the structure of taxes applied to oil and condensate production in Russia effectively reduce the exposure to international market prices for oil.
In addition the Ruble exchange rate has tended to move with the oil price reducing the overall volatility of oil prices when translated into Russian Rubles.
Market risks The Groups revenues generated from oil and condensate production have typically been from sales to local domestic customers.
There have been periods when the local market has been unable to purchase condensate causing temporary suspension of production and loss of revenues.
Since
November 2015 the Group has developed export channels for its condensate into regional export markets to mitigate this risk.
Gas sales are made to Gazprom.
The region in which the Group operates is reliant on external gas supplies.
Consequently estimate to be in line with the currently available field data and accordingly has chosen to adopt the preliminary estimates as the statement of the Groups oil gas and condensate reserves.
The Groups reserve statement is shown in the Operational Review on page 9.
The impact of the reserve revision has been to increase the depletion depreciation and amortisation charge of the Group with consequent reductions in the profit and net book value of the Groups assets.
While the reserve revisions do not appear to have triggered an impairment subsequent reserve evaluations may lead to further revisions which may impair the assets.
Furthermore if the results of producing the Groups fields are significantly different to expectations there may be changes in the future estimates of reserves.
These may impact both the future profitability and the balance sheet carrying values of the Groups property plant and equipment.
Environmental risk The oil and gas industry is subject to environmental hazards such as oil spills gas leaks ruptures and discharges of petroleum products and hazardous substances including waste materials generated by the sweetening process formerly in use at the Dobrinskoye gas processing plant.
These environmental hazards could expose the Group to material liabilities for property damages personal injuries or other environmental harm including costs of investigating and remediating contaminated properties.
The Group is subject to stringent environmental laws in Russia with regard to its oil and gas operations.
Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject the Group to material administrative civil or criminal penalties or other liabilities.
Additionally compliance with these laws may from time to time result in increased costs to the Groups operations impact production or increase the costs of potential acquisitions.
Groups gas is considered low.
Gas sales have generally been conducted as expected subject to occasional constraints during pipeline maintenance operations.
Oil and gas production taxes The Groups sales generated from oil and gas production are subject to Mineral Extraction Taxes MET which form a material proportion of the total costs of sales.
The rates of these taxes are subject to changes by the Russian government which relies heavily on such taxes for its revenues.
Changes to rate formulas which came into effect during 2015 and 2016 materially increased the rates on crude oil condensate and natural gas.
With oil prices recovering from recent lows MET rates have increased in line with current formulas.
As of 2019 the Russian government is planning trials of a profit based oil and gas taxation regime to replace the productionbased MET.
At present the impact on the Groups operations of any such change of tax regime is unknown.
Exploration and reserve risks Whilst the Group will seek to apply the latest technology to assess exploration licences the exploration for and development of hydrocarbons involves a high degree of risk.
These risks include the uncertainty that the Group will discover sufficient commercially exploitable oil or gas resources in unproven areas of its licences.
Unsuccessful exploration efforts may result in impairment to the balance sheet value of exploration assets.
However the Groups current plans involve limited expenditure in explorationrelated activities.
In February 2018 the Group commissioned an updated reserve evaluation based on reporting standards set by the Society of Petroleum Engineers.
The reserve report delivered to and adopted by management on 12 April 2018 resulted in a downward revision by approximately 27% to the Groups reserves as at 31 December 2017.
Management considers the new reserve 14 Volga Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 The Group liaises closely with the Federal Service of Environmental Technological and Nuclear Resources of the Saratov and Volgograd Oblasts on potential environmental impact of its operations and conducts environmental studies both as required by and in addition to its licence obligations to mitigate any specific risk.
The Groups operations are regularly subject to independent environmental audit.
The Group did not incur any material costs relating to the compliance with environmental laws during the period.
Risk of operating oil and gas properties The oil and gas business involves certain operating hazards such as well blowouts cratering explosions uncontrollable flows of oil gas or well fluids fires pollution and releases of toxic substances.
Any of these operating hazards could cause serious injuries fatalities or property damage which could expose the Group to liabilities.
The settlement of these liabilities could materially impact the funds available for the exploration and development of the Groups oil and gas properties.
The Group maintains insurance against many potential losses and liabilities arising from its operations in accordance with customary industry practices but the Groups insurance coverage cannot protect it against all operational risks.
Foreign currency risk The Groups capital expenditures and operating costs are predominantly in Russian Rubles RUR while a minority of administrative expense are in US Dollars Euros and Pounds Sterling.
Revenues are predominantly received in RUR so the operating profitability is not materially exposed to moderate shortterm exchange rate movements.
The functional currency of the Groups operating subsidiaries is the RUR and the Groups assets and liabilities are predominantly RUR denominated.
As the Groups presentational currency is the US Dollar fluctuations in the exchange rate of the RUR against the US Dollar impact the Groups financial statements.
Legal systems Russia and other countries in which the Group may transact business in the future have or may have legal systems that are less well developed than those in the United
This could result in risks such as Potential difficulties in obtaining effective legal redress in the court of such jurisdictions whether in respect of a breach of contract law or regulation including an ownership dispute.
A higher degree of discretion on the part of governmental authorities.
The lack of judicial or administrative guidance on interpreting applicable rules and regulations.
Inconsistencies or conflicts between and within various laws regulations decrees orders and resolutions.
Relative inexperience of the judiciary and courts in such matters.
In certain jurisdictions the commitment of local business people government officials and agencies and the judicial system to abide by legal requirements and negotiated agreements may be more uncertain creating particular concerns with respect to licences and agreements for business.
These may be susceptible to revision or cancellation and legal redress may be uncertain or delayed.
There can be no assurance that joint ventures licences licence applications or other legal arrangements will not be adversely affected by the jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
Business in Russia Amongst the risks that face the Group in conducting business and operations in Russia are Economic instability including in other countries or the global economy that could lead to consequences such as hyperinflation currency fluctuations and a decline in per capita income in the Russian economy.
Governmental and political instability that could disrupt delay or curtail economic and regulatory reform increase centralised authority or result in nationalisations.
Social instability from any ethnic religious historical or other divisions that could lead to a rise in nationalism social and political disturbances or conflict.
Uncertainties in the developing legal and regulatory environment including but not limited to conflicting laws decrees and regulations applicable to the oil and gas industry and foreign investment.
Unlawful or arbitrary action against the Group and its interests by the regulatory authorities including the suspension or revocation of their oil or gas contracts licences or permits or preferential treatment of their competitors.
Lack of independence and experience of the judiciary difficulty in enforcing court or arbitration decisions and governmental discretion in enforcing claims.
Unexpected changes to the federal and local tax systems.
Laws restricting foreign investment in the oil and gas industry.
The imposition of sanctions upon certain entities in Russia.
The Groups operations and financial management have not been impacted directly by any sanctions to date.

Capital risk The Group manages capital to ensure that it is able to continue as a going concern whilst maximising the return to shareholders.
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
The Board regularly monitors the future capital requirements of the Group particularly in respect of its ongoing development programme.
Management expects that the cash generated by the operating fields will be sufficient to sustain the Groups operations and committed capital investment for the foreseeable future and has a policy of maintaining a minimum level of liquidity to cover forward obligations.
Further shortterm debt facilities may be arranged to provide financial headroom for future development activities.
Bribery
The Company is subject to numerous requirements and standards including the UK Bribery Act.
In addition the Group is subject to antibribery and anticorruption laws and regulations in all jurisdictions in which it operates.
Failure to comply with regulations and requirements such as failure to implement adequate systems to prevent bribery and corruption could result in prosecution fines or penalties imposed on the Company or its officers or suspension of operations.
The Groups mitigation measures include compliance related activities training monitoring risk management due diligence and regular review of policies and procedures.
We prohibit bribery and corruption in any form by all employees and by those working for or connected with the business.
Employees are expected to report actual attempted or suspected bribery or other issues related to compliance to their line managers or through our confidential reporting process which is available to all staff as well as third parties.
Fraud
The Group has been exposed to fraudulent transfers of funds from its bank accounts and is at various times at risk to attempted fraud.
The Group has established enhanced protection of its information technology infrastructure operational systems and procedures against fraudulent activities.

Liquidity risk At 31 December 2017  the Group had US8.6 million 2016 US19.7 million of cash and cash equivalents of which US7.9 million was held in bank accounts in Russia 2016 6.1 million.
As at 31 December 2017  total bank debt was US4.0 million 2016 US4.0 million.
The Group has fully drawn on the debt facilities available as at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016.
The Group intends to fund its ongoing operations and development activities from its cash resources and cash generated by its established operations.
At 31 December 2017  the Group had budgeted capital expenditures of US5.9 million of which the significant items were US1.4 million for completion of the LPG project and US3.2 million for drilling of sidetrack wells and other development activities.
There were approximately US1.6 million of accounts payable relating to capital expenditures and other expenses incurred in the year ended 31 December 2017 2016 US4.8 million.
The Board considers that the Group will have sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations.
All current and planned capital expenditures are discretionary and may be deferred or cancelled in the light of the Groups cash generation and liquidity position.
Through the ordinary course of activities the Group is exposed to legal operational and development risk that could delay growth in its cash generation from operations or may require additional capital investment that could place increased burden on the Groups available financial resources.

In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Groups and of the Parent Companys affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the Groups profit for the year then ended the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRSs as adopted by the EU the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing UK ISAs UK and applicable law.
Our
We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under and are independent of the Group in accordance with UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion.
Key audit matters our assessment of risks of material misstatement Key audit matters are those matters that in our professional judgement were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement whether or not due to fraud identified by us including those which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
In arriving at our audit opinion above the key audit matters in decreasing order of audit significance as per the table on page 26.
Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at US350k 2016 US360k determined with reference to a benchmark of Group revenues of which it represents 1% 2016 1 %.
We consider Group revenues to be the most appropriate benchmark for overall levels of activity within the business and are measured in terms of revenue which is also considered one of the more prominent metrics in assessing overall Group performance.
We agreed to report to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding US18k 2016 US18k in addition to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
For both the current and prior year the Group audit team performed the audit of the Group including the Parent Company financial information as if it was a single aggregated set of financial information.
The Parent Company materiality was therefore lower than the materiality we would otherwise have determined with reference to a benchmark to the Parent Company net assets and represents 5% 2016 5% of this benchmark.
As such materiality for the Parent Company financial statements as a whole was set at US315k 2016 US360k to allow for aggregation risk on consolidation.
We have nothing to report on going concern We are required to report to you if we have concluded that the use of the going concern basis of accounting is inappropriate or there is an undisclosed material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt over the use of that basis for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
We have nothing to report in these respects.
We have nothing to report on the other information in the Annual Report The directors are responsible for the other information presented in the Annual Report together with the financial statements.
Our
Our responsibility is to read the other information and in doing so consider whether based on our financial statements audit work the information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with the financial statements or our audit knowledge.
Based solely on that work we have not identified material misstatements in the other information.
Strategic Report and Directors Report Based solely on our work on the other information we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors Report in our opinion the information given in those reports for the financial year is consistent with the financial statements and in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.

Independent Auditors Report
The risk Our response Impairment of tangible and intangible assets Tangible assets US62.3 million 2016 US55.9 million Intangible assets US3.8 million 2016 US3.5 million Refer to pages 3738 accounting policy and pages 4243 financial disclosures Forecastbased valuation A sustained low oil and gas price environment combined with ongoing changes in the Groups production operations could have a significant impact on the recoverable amount of the Groups tangible and intangible assets.
Forecasting the recoverable amount of the Groups CGUs both of which have had impairment indicators identified is a highly subjective area due to the inherent uncertainty involved in forecasting and discounting future cash flows specifically around oil and gas prices USDRUB exchange rates reserve estimates especially taking into account significant decrease in gas and gas condensate proved reserves during the period and future cost estimates.
Moreover there was significant capital expenditure during the reporting period towards implementation of Redox gas processing construction of an LPG extraction plant and drilling of a new horizontal oil well meaning there is a risk that such additional investments are not recoverable.
Our procedures included Impairment triggers analysis We assessed the directors judgements in considering if any impairment indicators were present by considering whether the appropriate business developments during the year were incorporated in that analysis.
Historical comparisons We assessed the reasonableness of the budgets considering historical accuracy of previous forecasts.
Evaluating assumptions We challenged the Groups key assumptions and estimates by comparing them to externally derived and historical data as well as to our own assessments.
We have consulted KPMG valuation specialists to assist us in the review of discount rates used in the model.
Evaluating reserves estimation We assessed competence and objectivity of the Groups external experts to satisfy ourselves they were appropriately qualified to carry out estimation of reserves included in the model.
We performed procedures to assess the reliability of the data provided to the external expert.
We considered whether the updated reserves estimates were included appropriately in the Groups impairment review forecasts.
Sensitivity analysis We performed sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions to assess whether a reasonably possible change in these assumptions could trigger an impairment charge.
Integrity of the model We assessed reasonableness of the model used challenged whether all appropriate cash flows are included as well as reviewed mathematical accuracy of the model.
Assessing transparency We assessed whether the Groups disclosures about the sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment assessment to changes in key assumptions reflected the risks inherent in the valuation of tangible and intangible assets.
Recoverability of Parent Companys investment in subsidiaries and receivables due from Group companies Investment in subsidiaries US28.3 million 2016 US50.5 million Loans due from Group companies US25.2 million 2016 US4.7 million Refer to pages 3839 accounting policy and pages 52 to 54 financial disclosures Low risk high value The carrying amounts of the Parent Companys investments in subsidiaries and receivables due from Group companies represent 99% 2016 94% of the Companys total assets.
Their recoverability is not at a high risk of significant misstatement or subject to significant judgement.
However due to their materiality in the context of the Parent Company financial statements this is considered to be the area that had the greatest effect on our overall Parent Company audit.
Our procedures included Tests of detail Comparing the carrying amount of all investments and intercompany debtors with the relevant subsidiaries financial statements to identify whether their net assets being an approximation of their minimum recoverable amount were in excess of their carrying amount and assessing whether those subsidiaries have historically been profitmaking.
Subsidiary audits The Group engagement team has performed the audit work for the trading subsidiaries of the Group including the impairment review of tangible and intangible assets as described above and considered the implication of that work on those subsidiaries profits and net assets.

We have nothing to report in these respects.
7 Respective responsibilities Directors responsibilities As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 22 the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements including being satisfied that they give a true and fair view such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error assessing the Group and Parent Companys ability to continue as a going concern disclosing as applicable matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors responsibilities Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error and to issue our opinion in an auditors report.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs UK will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if individually or in aggregate they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRCs website at www. rc. iteauditorsresponsibilities.
8 The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe our responsibilities This report is made solely to the Companys members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.

Notes to the IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 201 7 presented in US 000 General information Volga Gas plc the Company or Volga is a public limited company registered in England and Wales with registered number .
The Company was incorporated on 25 July 2006.
The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries the Group are the acquisition exploration and development of hydrocarbon assets and production of hydrocarbons in the Volga Region of the Russian Federation.
Its
The Companys shares are admitted to trading on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange.
These Group consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 12 April 2018.
Summary of significant accounting policies The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented unless otherwise stated.
2.1 Basis of preparation Both the Parent Company financial statements and the Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union EU International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in note 4.
No income statement is presented for Volga Gas plc as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
The Groups business activities together with the factors likely to affect its future development performance and position are set out in the Strategic Report in pages 2 to 15 the financial position of the Group its cash flows liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Review on pages 10 and 11.
In addition the Groups objectives policies and processes for measuring capital financial risk management objectives details of financial instruments and exposure to credit and liquidity risks are described in note 3.
Having reviewed the future cash flow forecasts of the Group in the light of the reductions in oil and gas reserves and in consideration of the current financial condition of the Group the directors have concluded that the Group will continue to have sufficient funds in order to meet its obligations as they fall due for at least the foreseeable future and thus continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
2.2 Adopted IFRS not yet applied The following adopted IFRSs have been issued but have not been applied by the Group in these financial statements.
Their adoption is not expected to have a material effect on the financial statements unless otherwise indicated IFRS 9 Financial Instruments effective date 1 January 2018.
IFRS 9 replaces the guidance in IAS 39 Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement on the classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities impairment of financial assets and on hedge accounting.
IFRS 9 contains a new classification and measurement approach for financial assets that reflects the business model in which assets are managed and their cash flow characteristics.
IFRS 9 also introduced a new impairment model with a forwardlooking expected credit loss ECL  model.
Based on the assessment the Group does not expect the application of IFRS 9 to have a significant impact on its financial statements other than the disclosure impact which the Group is finalising.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers effective date 1 January 2018.
IFRS 15 replaces the guidance in IAS 11 Construction Contracts and IAS 18 Revenue.
IFRS 15 provides a single model for accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers focusing on the identification and satisfaction of performance obligations.
The Group does not expect the application of IFRS 15 to have a significant impact on its financial statements.
IFRS 16 Leases effective date 1 January 2019.
IFRS 16 replaces existing leases guidance in IAS 17 Leases IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease SIC15 Operating Leases and SIC27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease.
Based on the assessment and lease contract review the impact of implementation of the standard will be limited to leases of administrative buildings and offices.
As such the Group does not expect the application of IFRS 16 to have significant impact on its financial statements.
36 Volga Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 20142016 Cycle date 1 January 2018 Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Sharebased Payment Transactions effective date 1 January 2018.
The Group is yet to assess the full impact of these new amendments and annual improvements but does not expect them to have a material impact on the financial statements.
Amendments to IAS 12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses effective date 1 January 2017.
Amendments to IAS 7 Disclosure Initiative effective date 1 January 2017.
These amendments were adopted by the Group in the year and do not have a material impact on its financial statements.
2.3 Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
In assessing control the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that are currently exercisable.
The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Losses applicable to the noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the noncontrolling interests even if doing so causes the noncontrolling interests to have a deficit balance.
Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less impairment.
Cost is adjusted to reflect changes in consideration arising from contingent consideration amendments.
Cost also includes direct attributable costs of investment.
Intercompany transactions balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the cost cannot be recovered.
The Company and its subsidiaries outside the Russian Federation maintain their financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU.
The Russian subsidiaries of the Group maintain their statutory accounting records in accordance with the Regulations on Accounting and Reporting of the Russian Federation.
The consolidated financial statements are based on these statutory accounting records appropriately adjusted and reclassified for fair presentation in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU.
A list of the Companys subsidiaries is provided in note 21.
2.4 Segment reporting Segmental reporting follows the Groups internal reporting structure.
Operating segments are defined as components of the Group where separate financial information is available and reported regularly to the chief operating decision maker CODM which is determined to be the Board of Directors of the Company.
The Board of Directors decides how to allocate resources and assesses operational and financial performance using the information provided.
The CODM receives monthly IFRSbased financial information for the Group and its development and production entities.
There were two development and production entities during both 2016 and 2017.
These entities both engage in upstream production gathering and sale of hydrocarbons with common operational management and control.
Management has determined that the operations of these production and development entities are sufficiently homogenous all are concerned with upstream oil and gas development and production activities for these to be aggregated for the purpose of IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
Common economic drivers for the operations are international oil prices export and Mineral Extraction Taxes and the costs of drilling completing and operating wells and production facilities.
The Group has other entities that engage as either head office or in a corporate capacity or as holding companies.
Management has concluded that due to application of the aggregation criteria that separate financial information for segments is not required.
No geographic segmental information is presented as all of the companies operating activities are based within a localised area of the Russian
Management has determined therefore that the operations of the Group comprise one class of business being oil and gas exploration development and production and the Group operates in only one geographic area  the Volga region of the Russian Federation.
The Groups gas sales representing a substantial proportion of revenues are made to a single customer.
Details are provided in note 3.1 b.

Summary of significant accounting policies continued 2.5 Foreign currency translation a Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in US Dollars which is the Companys functional and the Groups presentation currency.
The functional currency of the Groups subsidiaries that are incorporated in the Russian Federation is the Russian Ruble RUR.
It is managements view that the RUR best reflects the financial results of its Cyprus subsidiaries because they are dependent on entities based in Russia that operate in an RUR environment in order to recover their investments.
As a result the functional currency of the subsidiaries continues to be the RUR.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at yearend exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to cash and cash equivalents borrowings and other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the income statement within Other gains and losses.
The results and financial position of all the Group entities none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows assets and liabilities for each balance sheet item presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet ii income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions and iii all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.
The major exchange rates used for the revaluation of the closing balance sheet at 31 December 2017 were GBP 1.3485 US 2016 1.233 EUR 1.1956 US 2016 1.052 US 157.6002 RUR 2016 60.657 2.6 Oil and gas assets The Company and its subsidiaries apply the successful efforts method of accounting for exploration and evaluation EandE costs in accordance with IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources.
Costs are accumulated on a fieldbyfield basis.
Capital expenditure is recognised as property plant and equipment or intangible assets in the financial statements according to the nature of the expenditure and the stage of development of the associated field i. exploration development production.
Costs directly associated with an exploration well including certain geological and geophysical costs and exploration and property leasehold acquisition costs are capitalised as intangible assets until the determination of reserves is evaluated.
If it is determined that a commercial discovery has not been achieved these costs are charged to expense after the conclusion of appraisal activities.
Exploration costs such as geological and geophysical that are not directly related to an exploration well are expensed as incurred.
Once commercial reserves are found exploration and evaluation assets are tested for impairment and transferred to development assets.
No depreciation or amortisation is charged during the exploration and evaluation phase.
Expenditure on the construction installation or completion of infrastructure facilities such as platforms pipelines and the drilling of development wells into commercially proven reserves is capitalised within property plant and equipment.
When development is completed on a specific field it is transferred to producing assets as part of property plant and equipment.
No depreciation or amortisation is charged during the development phase.
38 Volga Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Summary of significant accounting policies continued c Oil and gas production assets Production assets are accumulated generally on a fieldbyfield basis and represent the cost of developing the commercial reserves discovered and bringing them into production together with EandE expenditures incurred in finding commercial reserves and transferred from the intangible EandE assets as described above.
The cost of production assets also includes the cost of acquisitions and purchases of such assets directly attributable overheads finance costs capitalised and the cost of recognising provisions for future restoration and decommissioning.
Where major and identifiable parts of the production assets have different useful lives they are accounted for as separate items of property plant and equipment.
Costs of minor repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.
Oil and gas properties are depreciated or amortised using the unitofproduction method.
Unitofproduction rates are based on proved reserves which are oil gas and other mineral reserves estimated to be recovered from existing facilities using current operating methods.
Oil and gas volumes are considered produced once they have been measured through meters at custody transfer or sales transaction points at the outlet valve on the field storage tank.
Exploration and evaluation assets are tested for impairment prior to reclassification to development tangible assets or whenever facts and circumstances indicate that an impairment condition may exist.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the exploration and evaluation assets carrying amount exceeds their recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the exploration and evaluation assets fair value less costs to sell and their value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment the exploration and evaluation assets subject to testing are grouped with existing cashgenerating units of production fields that are located in the same geographical region.
Proven oil and gas properties are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
The cashgenerating unit applied for impairment test purposes is generally the field except that a number of field interests may be grouped together where the cash flows of each field are interdependent for instance where surface infrastructure is used by one or more field in order to process production for sale.
Provision is made for the cost of decommissioning assets at the time when the obligation to decommission arises.
Such provision represents the estimated discounted liability the discount rate used currently being at 10% per annum for costs which are expected to be incurred in removing production facilities and site restoration at the end of the producing life of each field.
A corresponding item of property plant and equipment is also created at an amount equal to the provision.
This is subsequently depreciated as part of the capital costs of the production facilities.
Any change in the present value of the estimated expenditure attributable to changes in the estimates of the cash flow or the current estimate of the discount rate used are reflected as an adjustment to the provision and the property plant and equipment.
The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost.
2.7 Other business and corporate assets Property plant and equipment not associated with exploration and production activities are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
These assets are also evaluated for impairment when circumstances dictate.
Land is not depreciated.
Depreciation of other assets is calculated on a straightline basis as follows Machinery and equipment 610 years Office equipment in excess of US5000 34 years Vehicles and other 27 years Depreciation methods useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date.
2.8 Financial assets The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories a Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading.
This category comprises derivatives unless they are effective hedging instruments.
The Group had no financial assets in this class as at 31 December 2017 or 31 December 2016.

Summary of significant accounting policies continued b Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
This category comprises trade and other receivables term bank deposits and cash and cash equivalents in balance sheet.
2.9 Inventories Crude oil inventories are stated at the lower of cost of production and net realisable value.
Materials and supplies inventories are recorded at average cost and are carried at amounts which do not exceed the expected recoverable amount from use in the normal course of business.
Cost comprises direct materials and where applicable direct labour plus attributable overheads based on a normal level of activity and other costs associated in bringing inventories to their present location and condition.
2.10 Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate.
2.11 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits held at call with banks.
2.12 Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction net of tax from the proceeds.
2.13 Trade payables Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
2.14 Current and deferred income tax The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
In this case the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period in the countries where the Companys subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation.
It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred income tax is recognised using the liability method on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
However the deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
2.15 Employee benefits a Sharebased compensation The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted excluding the impact of any nonmarket vesting conditions for example profitability and sales growth targets.
Nonmarket vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest.
The option plan currently in place for certain of the directors is an equitysettled share option plan.
40 Volga Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Summary of significant accounting policies continued The Company measures the equity instruments granted to employees at the fair value at grant date.
The fair value of fully vested shares is expensed immediately.
The fair value of shares with vesting requirements is estimated using the BlackScholes option pricing model.
This value is recognised as an expense over the vesting period on a straightline basis.
The estimate is revised as necessary if subsequent information indicates that the number of equity instruments expected to vest differs from previous estimates.
Wages salaries contributions to the Russian Federation state pension and social insurance funds paid annual leave sick leave and bonuses are accrued in the year in which the associated services are rendered by the employees of the Group.
2.16 Revenue recognition Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of oil and gas in the ordinary course of the Groups activities.
Revenue is shown net of value added tax returns rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group.
Revenue from the sale of oil or gas is recognised when the oilgas is delivered to customers and title has transferred.
In 2016 and 2017  the Groups revenue related to sales of crude oil and condensate collected directly by or delivered to customers and gas sales made at the entry to the gas distribution system.
2.17 Prepayments Prepayments are carried at cost less provision for impairment.
A prepayment is classified as noncurrent when the goods or services relating to the prepayment are expected to be obtained after one year or when the prepayment relates to an asset which will itself be classified as noncurrent upon initial recognition.
Prepayments to acquire assets are transferred to the carrying amount of the asset once the Group has obtained control of the asset and it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the asset will flow to the Group.
Other
If there is an indication that the assets goods or services relating to a prepayment will not be received the carrying value of the prepayment is written down accordingly and a corresponding impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss for the year.
2.18 Provisions Provisions for environmental restoration restructuring costs and legal claims are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated.
Restructuring provisions comprise lease termination penalties and employee termination payments.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Where there are a number of similar obligations the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole.
A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pretax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.
The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense.
Financial risk management 3.1 Financial risk factors The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks market risk including foreign exchange risk price risk and cash flow interest rate risk credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from currency exposures primarily with respect to the RUR.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions recognised assets and liabilities.

The Group is not directly exposed to the levels of international marker prices of crude oil or oil products although these clearly influence the prices at which it sells its oil and condensate.
Mineral Extraction Taxes MET are calculated by reference to Urals oil prices and are therefore directly influenced by this.
Taking into account the marginal rates of export taxes and MET management estimates that if international oil prices had been US5 per barrel higher or lower and all other variables been unchanged the Groups profit before tax would have been US1.5 million higher or lower 2016 2.7 million.
As the Group currently has no significant interestbearing assets and liabilities the Groups income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
The Groups maximum credit risk exposure is the fair value of each class of assets presented in note 3.1ai of US8617 000 and US19718000 at 31 December 2017 and 2016 respectively.
The Groups principal financial asset is cash and credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions.
It is the Groups policy to monitor the financial standing of these assets on an ongoing basis.
Bank balances are held with reputable and established financial institutions.
The Groups oil and condensate sales are normally undertaken on a prepaid basis and accordingly the Group has no trade receivables and consequently no credit risk associated with the related trade receivables.
Gas sales accounting for 35.4% of Group revenues in 2017 2016 35.6% were made to Gazprom 2016 to Trans Nafta.
As at 31 December 2017 there were trade receivables of US1.3 million 31 December 2016 US2.0 million relating to gas sales.
As at 31 December 2017 there was no provision for bad debts 2016 nil.

Group finance monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs.
The Group believes it has sufficient liquidity headroom to fund its currently planned exploration and development activities.
The Group expects to fund its capital investments as well as its administrative and operating expenses through 2018 using a combination of cash generated from its oil and gas production activities existing working capital and when appropriate mediumterm bank borrowings.
If the Group is unsuccessful in generating enough liquidity to fund its expenditures the Groups ability to execute its longterm growth strategy could be significantly affected.
The Group may need to raise additional equity or debt finance as appropriate to fund investments beyond its current commitments.
The Group manages capital to ensure that it is able to continue as a going concern whilst maximising the return to shareholders.
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
The Board regularly monitors the future capital requirements of the Group particularly in respect of its ongoing development programme.
Management expects that the cash generated by the operating fields will be sufficient to sustain the Groups operations and future capital investment for the foreseeable future.
During December 2016 one of the Groups operating subsidiaries entered into a loan agreement of RUR 240 million to fund its LPG project see note 20.
This loan which has a threeyear amortising term benefits from an interest rate subsidy provided by the regional government.
Further shortterm debt facilities may be arranged to provide financial headroom for future development activities.
3.2 Fair value estimation Effective 1 January 2009 the Group adopted the amendment to IFRS 7 for financial instruments that are measured in the balance sheet at fair value.
This requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1.
Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly that is as prices or indirectly that is derived from prices level 2.
Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is unobservable inputs level 3.
The Group has no financial assets and liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future.
The resulting accounting estimates will by definition seldom equal the related actual results.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Fixed assets and intangible assets are assessed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that an impairment condition may exist.
The carrying value of fixed assets and intangible assets are evaluated by reference to their value in use and primarily looks to the present value of managements best estimate of the cash flows expected to be generated from the asset.
In identifying cash flows management firstly determines the cashgenerating unit or group of assets that give rise to the cash flows.
The cashgenerating unit CGU is the lowest level of asset at which independent cash flows can be generated.
For this purpose the directors consider the Group to have two CGUs the VM and Dobrinskoye fields with the Dobrinskoye gas processing plant are treated as a single CGU and the Uzen oil field is a separate CGU.
The estimation of forecast cash flows involves the application of a number of significant judgements and estimates to a number of variables including production volumes commodity prices operating costs capital investment hydrocarbon reserves estimates and discount rates.
Key assumptions and estimates in the impairment models relate to International oil prices flat real prices reflecting the actual levels pertaining at 31 December 2017  Urals oil price of US65 per barrel.
No forward price escalation is assumed.
Selling prices for oil condensate and LPG that reflect international oil prices less export taxes at the current applicable official rates and a price differential of 5 per barrel to reflect transportation costs.
Based on commercial studies conducted during 2016 and 2017 LPG is expected to achieve a premium per tonne over condensate whereas the models assume price parity.
Gas sales price of RUR 4025 per mcm excluding VAT.
Production profiles based on remaining reserves in the proved category and approved field development plans.
For the purposes of impairment testing the level of reserves used are those recently provided to the Group by the independent consultancy Geostream.
While it has been included in the production profile the LPG production has not yet been established although it is expected to commence in April 2018.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued Capital expenditures required to deliver the above production profiles and to maintain the production assets throughout the field life.
Total development capital expenditure assumed is US5 million with future maintenance capital expenditure of up to US2 million per annum.
The principal items being the completion of the LPG plant and sidetracks to two gascondensate wells.
Cost assumptions are based on current experience and expectations and are broadly in line with unit costs experienced in the year ended 31 December 2017  including an annual estimated cost saving of US4.0 million from the successful implementation of Redoxbased gas sweetening.
Export and mineral extraction taxes reflect rates set by current legislation.
The model reflects real terms cash flows with no inflationary escalation of revenues or costs.
A real discount rate of 12% per annum is utilised in the models.
An exchange rate of RUR57 to US1.00 is assumed.
Under the base case assumptions the value in use of each CGU was shown to be in excess of its respective carrying value.
In addition to the base case a number of sensitivity cases have been carried out varying oil and gas prices by 10% varying operating expenditure by 10% varying capital expenditure by 20% varying reserves by 10% and using a 15% real discount rate.
In aggregate the sensitivities yielded net present values in excess of carrying values for the CGUs in all of these cases the net present value under the sensitivities remained above the carrying value of individual CGUs.
Under the base case economic assumptions as outlined above the reserves at the VM and Dobrinskoye fields would need to drop by a further 26% below the level as at 31 December 2017 and the Uzen oil field reserves would need to drop by 19% below current levels for the value in use to reach the respective carrying value.
A further sensitivity in which LPG was excluded from the production profile brought the value in use down to approximately US1.5 million or 2.9% below the level of the carrying value of the VM and Dobrinskoye CGU under the base case assumptions and up to US8.6 million or 16.6% below the carrying value under the various sensitivity cases outlined above.
However the impairment testing model is based on the existing and approved plans and forecasts in which LPG is one of the drivers of future cash flows.
Presently the LPG project is commencing the commissioning process and there is no indication that it will not be operating as expected though the various sensitivities affecting LPG streams were considered.
Accordingly as at 31 December 2017  based on the Groups impairment testing of the property plant and equipment related to each CGU management concluded that no clear impairment was indicated.
However should there be material adverse changes to the assumptions used in future impairment tests or should there be further reductions in reserve estimates there may be impairment of one or both of the CGUs.
Estimates of oil and gas reserves are inherently subjective and subject to periodic revision.
In addition the results of drilling and other exploration or development or production activity will often provide additional information regarding the Groups reserve base that may result in increases or decreases to reserve volumes.
Such revisions to reserves can be significant and are not predictable with any degree of certainty.
Management considers the estimation of reserves to represent a significant judgement in the context of the financial statements as reserve volumes are used as the basis for assessing the useful life of oil and gas assets applying depreciation to oil and gas assets and in assessing the carrying value of oil and gas assets.
Decreases in reserve estimates can lead to significant impairment of oil and gas assets where revisions positive or negative can have a significant effect on depreciation rates from period to period.
Variation of 10% from the base level of reserves is among the sensitivity tests carried out in impairment testing as described in note 4a above.
An independent assessment of the reserves and net present value of future net revenues NPV attributable to the Groups fields Dobrinskoye Vostochny Makarovskoye Sobolevskoye and Uzenskoye as at 31 December 2016 was prepared in accordance with reserve definitions set by the Oil and Gas Reserves Committee of the Society of Petroleum Engineers SPE.
In February 2018 the Group commissioned an update to this report as late in 2017  the presence of increased formation water was observed during gas production from certain of the production wells on the VM field.
The results delivered to management imply a negative revision to reserves of approximately 27% below the level of reserves as at 31 December 2016 as adjusted for production during 2017.
The catalyst for this revision was a recalculation of recovery factors following the recent detection of the presence of formation water in certain of the wells in the VM field.
Management considers these revised estimates to be reasonable and is adopting them as the Groups reserves.
As outlined above management considers that for the time being no clear impairment is indicated although further downward revisions may necessitate impairment charges in the future.

Contingencies and commitments 24.1 Capital commitments As of the balance sheet date all material licence work obligations have been met and all of the Groups capital expenditures and work programmes are discretionary.
As of the balance sheet date the Board had approved a work programme for 2018 with a total capital expenditure budget of US5.9 million of which US1.4 million had been contracted.
The remainder is expected to be incurred but had not been committed to or contracted as at the balance sheet date.
24.2 Operating leases The Group has no noncancellable lease rental obligations.
24.3 Taxation Russian tax currency and customs legislation is subject to varying interpretations and changes which can occur frequently.
Managements interpretation of such legislation as applied to the transactions and activity of the Group may be challenged by the relevant regional and federal authorities.
Recent events within the Russian Federation suggest that the tax authorities may be taking a more assertive position in their interpretation of the legislation and assessments and it is possible that transactions and activities that have not been challenged in the past may be challenged.
As a result significant additional taxes penalties and interest may be assessed.
Fiscal periods remain open to review by the authorities in respect of taxes for three calendar years preceding the year of review but under certain circumstances reviews may cover longer periods.
At 31 December 2017  management believes that its interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate and the Groups tax currency and customs positions will be sustained.
24.4 Restoration rehabilitation and environmental costs The Group operates in the upstream oil industry in the Russian Federation and its activities may have an impact on the environment.
The enforcement of environmental regulations in the Russian Federation is evolving and the enforcement posture of government authorities is continually being reconsidered.
The Group periodically evaluates its obligation related thereto.
The outcome of environmental liabilities under proposed or future legislation or as a result of stricter interpretation and enforcement of existing legislation cannot reasonably be estimated at present but could be material.
Under the current levels of enforcement of existing legislation management believes there are no significant liabilities in addition to amounts which are already accrued and which would have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Group.
24.5 Oil field licences The Group is subject to periodic reviews of its activities by governmental authorities with respect to the requirements of its oil field licences.
Management of the Group corresponds with governmental authorities to agree on remedial actions if necessary to resolve any findings resulting from these reviews.
Failure to comply with the terms of a licence could result in fines penalties licence limitation suspension or revocation.
The Groups management believes any issues of noncompliance would be resolved through negotiations or corrective actions without any materially adverse effect on the financial position or the operating results of the Group.
The principal licences of the Group and their expiry dates are Field Licence holder
