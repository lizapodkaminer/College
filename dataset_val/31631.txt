Chairmans statement
Our position going into the next financial year is strong.
Our yearend private forward order book is at a record level at 242.4m which combined with a strong pipeline in both divisions positions us well to achieve our ambitious growth plans.
Returns to shareholders Our share price performed well over the course of the financial year reflecting the performance of the business along with continued investor education.
In the year to 30 September 2017 we delivered a total shareholder return of 46.6 per cent compared to 13.5 per cent for the FTSE 250 excluding Investment Trusts.
With the growth in earnings our proposed dividend per share has also increased by 147 per cent with a recommended final dividend per share of 5.0 pence.
Subject to approval at the AGM on 25 January 2018 the dividend will be paid on 9 February 2018 to shareholders registered at 22 December 2017.
T ogether with the interim dividend of 3.4 pence per share this will give a total dividend for the year of 8.4 pence per share.
Priorities of the Board The Board continues to regard corporate governance as a core and vital discipline complementing our desire to continually improve upon the success of the Group on behalf of our shareholders.
During 2017 particular areas of focus were to develop policies and procedures to address the new Consumer Code for Home Builders and to prepare for the introduction of the Criminal Finance Act and the General Data Protection Regulation.
Countryside has delivered another year of significant progress completing 3389 homes while maintaining a strong balance sheet and with excellent visibility over our future growth ambitions.
Well positioned for growth During 2017 the business continued to perform well delivering on the key targets set out at our initial public offering IPO in February 2016.
Political support for the housebuilding industry remains strong and we welcome the Governments commitment to housing with the white paper Fixing our broken housing market and subsequently announced increased funding for both affordable housing and the Help to Buy scheme.
At our interim results in May 2017 we upgraded the targets that we set out at our IPO as we saw opportunities to accelerate delivery on a number of our Partnerships sites.
We remain firmly on track to deliver these targets and indeed exceeded our 28 per cent return on capital employed ROCE target in 2017 a year ahead of plan.
We maintained our focus on capital discipline and ended the year with 77.4m of net cash on the balance sheet.
During the year we extended our 300m revolving credit facility out to May 2022 and we continue to have significant headroom.
While there are substantial plans for investment in our developments during 2018 our policy remains to be broadly debt neutral at the end of each financial year.
As we enter 2018 our key areas of focus continue to be to support implementation of the Groups business strategy to deepen the succession planning for the Board and Executive Committee and to ensure that corporate governance and risk management mitigation plans are embedded across the business.
There were two Board changes during the course of the year.
On 26 May 2017 we announced that Oaktree had completed a sale of shares in Countryside reducing its remaining shareholding to approximately 23 per cent of the Companys issued share capital.
As a consequence James Van Steenkiste stepped down from the Board on 5 June 2017 as per the Relationship Agreement between Oaktree and the Company.
Additionally on 2 October 2017 Richard Adam announced his intention to step down as a NonExecutive Director of the Company with his last day of service being 31 December 2017.
On behalf of the Board I would like to thank both James and Richard for their significant contributions to the Board and its Committees since joining Countryside.
The whole Board wishes them both well for the future.
A search for Richards successor is well under way and an announcement of the appointment will be made in due course.
Our people We recognise that our people are the most important factor in delivering on our ambitious growth plans and we continue to invest in developing them at all levels.
As at 30 September 2017 we had over 1200 employees 12 per cent more than a year ago.
We are recruiting more apprentices graduates and trainees than ever before.
In addition we have placed great focus on succession planning at all levels during the year.
In May we were delighted to announce the reshaping of our Executive Committee following the retirement of Richard Cherry with Ian Kelley Nick Worrall and Phillip Lyons who joined the business as Chief Executive of our Housebuilding division joining the executive team.
The quality and commitment of our people was recognised with a number of awards during the year including Large Housebuilder of the Year at the Housebuilder Awards.
I would like to thank each and every one of our employees for their hard work during the course of the year.

Group Chief Executives review
The Group continues to make progress with its strategic objectives of sectorleading growth superior return on capital and building resilience through the economic cycle.
Our Housebuilding model is based on an industryleading strategic land bank all of which is located in economically resilient markets in Outer London and the Home
Over 80 per cent of our land bank is strategically sourced via longterm planning promotion which offers Countryside over ten years visibility of future supply together with an average 10 per cent discount to the prevailing open market value.
Additionally as 73 per cent of this land is controlled via options or conditional contracts it ensures both balance sheet efficiency and flexibility through the cycle.
Overview of the market Overall the backdrop for the UK housing market remains positive with continued strong customer demand favourable mortgage lending conditions and good political support.
During the year all political parties recognised the need for additional housing not just because of the chronic need for new homes but also because of the important role that housebuilding plays in the wider economy.
In February 2017 the Government issued a housing white paper Fixing our broken housing market which set out a broad range of reforms to help shape the housing market and increase the supply of new homes.
One of the main themes of the report was a shift in focus from home ownership to increasing supply of all tenures of housing including more affordable and PRS homes.
In October 2017 the Government reaffirmed its support for housing committing a further 2bn of funding to deliver more affordable homes and an additional 10bn of funding for the Help to Buy scheme which currently runs to 2021.
Group strategy Our mixedtenure model gives us the ability to build sites out more quickly delivering much needed highquality housing.
We deliver this strategy through our two balanced operating divisions of Partnerships and Housebuilding both of which offer strong growth through differentiated models that deliver capital efficiency and manage risk.
Our developments offer a wide range of price points with homes for firsttime buyers through to larger homes from our premium brand Millgate.
Our Partnerships division operates in Outer London the West Midlands and the North West of England.
It delivers private affordable and Private Rental Sector PRS homes on larger sites typically public sector brownfield sites or local authority estate regeneration.
The land is typically sourced via public procurement or direct negotiation and is developed in partnership with local authorities housing associations or PRS providers.
It is a lowcapital model offering strong returns and the flexibility of longterm development agreements many with phased viability and priority returns.
The division has an excellent track record of winning new work reflecting over 30 years experience on over 60 regeneration schemes strong relationships with local authorities and expertise in placemaking.
T ypically we secure around 40 per cent of bids we submit and with a current pipeline of approximately nine years we have excellent visibility of future work.
Supply of both private and public land remains good.
In particular during the period we saw a further increase in public sector land being released for regeneration giving us additional opportunities to secure more work.
Labour supply continues to be constrained across the industry and we along with the Home Builders Federation have been encouraging the Government to protect the status of EU construction workers as a vital part of the UK economy and to protect future development.
T o mitigate this risk we are recruiting a record number of apprentices and management trainees and have expanded our graduate recruitment programme.
In addition our larger site profile allows us to retain and expand our supply chain by offering greater visibility of future work and longer contracts.
Overall build cost inflation was approximately four per cent for the year.
In order to meet the increased demand for housing despite the labour shortage the industry must also look at different build methodologies to deliver growth in output.
We already utilise offsite timber frame construction on around 40 per cent of our current output.
We are examining the way that this process can be enhanced to include all windows firstfix plumbing and electrical insulation and plasterboard in a closed panel system.
We believe that offsite construction is integral to meeting our growth plans and securing our supply chain for the future.
Our performance 2017 was another year of strong progress with both divisions performing well.
Overall the Group has grown strongly with total completions up 28 per cent to 3389 homes 2016 2657 homes driven by construction site starts and increased open sales outlets.
As anticipated growth of private for sale homes was particularly strong up 47 per cent to 1662 homes 2016 1127 homes as the large number of sites started in 2016 reached full production.
However private for sale completions were still less than half of our overall delivery during the year reflecting our strategy of mixedtenure development.
28% growth in total completions active sites at 30 September 2017 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Countryside Properties PLC  Annual report 2017 T otal adjusted revenue was up 32 per cent to 1028.8m 2016 777.0m with a planned decline in the Group private average selling price ASP to 430000 2016 465000 more than offset by an increase in affordable ASP.
Underlying house price inflation was five per cent during the year and offset build cost inflation in both divisions.
Our net reservation rate was above our target range at 0.84 reservations per open sales outlet 2016 0.78 on an increased number of open sales outlets at 47 2016 43.
At 30 September 2017 we had a further 41 sites under construction.
We continue to focus on capital and operational efficiency both at the divisional and at the Group level.
Group operating margin increased by 20bps which together with increased revenue gave an adjusted Group operating profit of 164.1m 2016 122.5m up 34 per cent on the prior year.
This combined with our focus on capital efficiency allowed us to exceed our ROCE target of 28 per cent as set out at our IPO a year earlier than planned at 30.5 per cent in 2017 up 370bps on the prior year 2016 26.8 per cent.
We pride ourselves on the quality of our product and were delighted to be named Large Housebuilder of the Y ear at the recent Housebuilder Awards.
In addition we were presented with a further nine awards during the year for work at Acton Gardens London Abode Cambridge Woolley Hall Berkshire and Englemere Ascot.
The standard of our business has also been maintained throughout this period of growth.
Our health and safety Accident Incident Rate was 220 2016 305 significantly better than the Health and Safety Executive construction index and the Home Builders Federation industry benchmark.
National House Building Council NHBC reportable items were 0.21 per home 2016 0.23 which was again significantly ahead of the industry benchmark.
We maintained our focus on our objective of becoming a fivestar builder during the year and our customer service has continued to improve.
Our customer satisfaction as measured by the NHBC Recommend a Friend score now stands at 88.6 per cent 2016 84.8 per cent.
Outlook
Current trading has remained robust since year end.
Low interest rates and increased demand from firsttime buyers supported by Help to Buy continue to underpin private for sale homes while the structural demand for affordable and PRS homes further supports our growth plans.
We continue to successfully convert our strategic land bank to open more sites and as a result our Housebuilding division is on its way to optimal scale.
This growth combined with our excellent pipeline of Partnerships work which allowed us to increase our targets at our interim results and a record yearend forward order book gives us great confidence to deliver our mediumterm plans.
We are encouraged by the continued political support for all tenures of housing with the recently increased commitments to both Help to Buy and affordable housing and we feel we are ideally placed to benefit from these policies.
Ian Sutcliffe Group Chief Executive 21 November 2017 of reservations in our private forward order book On a reported basis revenue increased 26 per cent to 845.8m 2016 671.3m.
On a reported basis Group operating profit was increased 48 per cent to 128.9m 2016 87.3m.
Countryside Properties PLC  Annual report 2017 KEY TRENDS IN THE HOUSING MARKET Our markets The backdrop for the UK housing market remains positive with continued strong customer demand favourable mortgage lending conditions and good political support.
Mixedtenure delivery In part the structural undersupply in housing has been caused by the lack of affordable housing being built in England.
Largescale local authority housing estates constructed in the 1960s and 1970s have not been replicated in the past 35 years and the delivery of social housing within private developments under Section 106 agreements has not kept up with demand.
Private Rental Sector PRS housing has largely been provided by small independent landlords in poor quality older homes with little purposebuilt PRS housing being constructed over the same period.
While there is increased appetite from institutional investors there remains a structural undersupply of good quality homes for market rent in most urban areas.
Our response We are committed to delivering a mixedtenure approach on our developments.
We differ from all other major housebuilders in that the private for sale homes made up just less than half 49 per cent of our total completions in 2017 with 30 per cent affordable and 21 per cent PRS homes.
Our Partnerships division delivers a balanced mix of all three tenure types giving it the benefit of being able to grow more rapidly with the added benefit of business resilience should the private for sale market start to slow.
Government policy All political parties have recognised the need for additional housing not just because of the chronic need for new homes but also because of the important role that housebuilding plays in the wider economy.
Recent policy has focused on stimulating demand for home ownership through programmes such as Help to Buy which has helped over 140000 families own a home over the past four years.
Commitment to the Help to Buy programme has been made to 2021 and the scheme was recently bolstered by an additional 10bn of funding.
Additionally the Government has committed a further 2bn of funding to deliver affordable homes and the National Planning Policy Framework is ensuring that all local authorities have a consistently calculated fiveyear supply of land for new homes.
Our response We are ideally placed to benefit from the commitment to deliver more new homes of all tenures.
In 2017 88 per cent of our private for sale homes were eligible for the Help to Buy programme and it was utilised on 27 per cent of our total completions across the Group.
We deliver a greater proportion of affordable housing in London than any other major housebuilder and through our Partnerships division we have a nineyear pipeline of future work.
We also have an industryleading owned or controlled land bank all within 50 miles of London the vast majority of which 83 per cent has been strategically sourced.
Read more on page 19 Structural undersupply of housing The longterm undersupply of housing as first identified in the 2004 Barker Review meant that a minimum of 200000 new homes per year were required in England to maintain the supply and demand balance.
It has subsequently been recognised that additional latent demand has built up over the past 25 years such that this number needs to be around 250000 and possibly more.
While the supply of new housing has grown steadily over the past six years the number of net additions to the housing stock was just 190000 last year.
Our response We have been growing our total annual completions over the past five years from 1903 homes in 2012 to 3389 homes in 2017.
Our business has the resources both in people and financial strength to continue this growth in the medium term both in our existing areas of operation and in newer geographies such as the West Midlands.
We continue to see significant future growth in both our Partnerships and Housebuilding divisions which in turn will drive improved operating margins from greater scale.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Countryside Properties PLC  Annual report 2017 Future regulation Following the tragic events at Grenfell T ower a wideranging inquiry has commenced to establish the causes and examine the responses to this disaster.
While the inquiry is yet to be concluded the Government has required all housebuilders and property owners to review the fire strategy for all buildings built or refurbished since 2005 and in particular the materials used on buildings greater than 18 metres in height.
Additionally a consultation has commenced into leasehold reform with a focus on the creation of leasehold houses ground rent escalation and freeholder management charges.
This consultation is due to report its findings at the end of 2017.
Our response We have carried out a thorough review of all buildings constructed since 2005 and have little exposure to either tall buildings or refurbishments.
We have identified only one development where corrective work is required.
In conjunction with the housing association which owns the property a scope of works has been agreed to fully remediate the fire strategy for the development and will be completed by the end of 2017.
On leasehold reform we have committed to ensuring that houses are sold on a freehold basis wherever we own the land and where leasehold is required the terms of the lease are clear and affordable.
We had a small number of developments where on review we felt that the ground rent rose too quickly and we have committed to amend those leases to fairer terms at our expense.
Labour supply The housebuilding industry has a shortage of skilled and experienced labour at all levels.
Chronic underinvestment over the past 25 years followed by the 2008 recession has eroded the workforce considerably at a time when a significant increase in output is required.
The skills gap has largely been filled by overseas workers from the European Union EU and beyond who now make up a significant proportion of the workforce especially in Greater London.
Brexit negotiations have led to uncertainty over the security of the EU workforce not just from potential future employment restrictions but also from possible economic migration caused by Sterling devaluation.
Our response We together with the Home Builders Federation have been encouraging the Government to protect the status of EU construction workers as a vital part of the UK economy.
At the same time we are mitigating the risk of a lack of labour availability by recruiting a record number of apprentices and management trainees and expanding our graduate recruitment programme.
Our directly employed workforce has grown from fewer than 600 in 2014 to over 1200 in 2017 as we focus on our growth agenda by recruiting retaining and developing the best talent at all levels.
Our larger sites also allow us to retain and expand our supply chain by offering longerterm contracts and better quality working conditions.
Offsite construction In order to meet the increased demand for housing despite the labour shortage the industry must look at different build methodologies to deliver growth in output.
While the industry has not yet fully embraced nontraditional build several methods of offsite construction are being developed from timber frame construction to complete modular build.
With Government and public sector land owner support together with potential future fire safety regulations the case for offsite construction has grown.
The principal benefits are speed of build lower reliance on scarce site skills and improved build quality from automated processes.
Our response We already utilise offsite timber frame construction on around 40 per cent of our current output.
We are examining the way that this process can be enhanced to include all windows firstfix plumbing and electrical insulation and plasterboard in a closed panel system.
T ogether with our supply chain partners we are also looking to automate the production process of the panels to improve capacity product quality and efficiency.
We believe that offsite construction is integral to meeting our growth plans and securing our supply chain for the future.

Strategy
Our Partnerships division specialises in medium to largescale urban regeneration of public sector land delivering much needed quality housing.
It operates primarily in and around London the West Midlands and the North West of England.
It delivers a resilient lowrisk lowcapital model developing urban regeneration in partnership with public sector landowners such as local authorities and housing associations.
We have a strong track record of delivering more than 60 regeneration projects over 30 years.
Developments are mixed tenure in nature delivering private affordable and PRS homes in line with the Groups placemaking ethos.
The Southern region focuses on local authority estate regeneration delivering increased density in apartmentled schemes in Outer London.
The
Northern and Midlands regions typically focus on brownfield land delivering lowrise family houses in the North West of England and the West Midlands.
Market
During 2017 there was a political shift in focus from home ownership to increasing supply of all tenures of housing including more affordable and PRS homes.
This plays to the strengths of our Partnerships model where schemes offer a mix of housing allowing us to build sites out more quickly without saturating the market.
During the year we saw further growth in the number of bid opportunities for both brownfield and estate regeneration as local authorities look to increase housing supply and improve the quality of their affordable housing stock.
Within the PRS market while there is increased appetite from institutional investors there remains a structural undersupply of good quality homes for market rent in most urban areas.
Our performance Our Partnerships division continued its strong growth trajectory in 2017 with total completions up 17 per cent to 2192 homes 2016 1874 homes particularly driven by significant growth in private completions up 31 per cent to 825 homes 2016 628 homes.
Partnerships private ASP increased by 12 per cent to 343000 2016 307000 including likeforlike growth of seven per cent reflecting house price inflation in the London Boroughs and regional cities as well as the impact of regeneration delivering added value on our developments.
In total we delivered 1182 affordable homes 2016 1131 homes including 721 PRS homes 2016 738 homes with the majority through our partnership with Sigma Capital in the North West and Midlands regions.
Countryside Properties PLC  Annual report 2017 All text and images to be supplied Our performance continued During the year we delivered homes on a number of key regeneration schemes within our Southern region including at Acton where we delivered 276 homes completing three phases and we commenced development on further phases including the neighbourhood centre.
At St Pauls Square in Bow where we accelerated development in the prior year we completed 121 homes and at East City Point in Canning T own we delivered 132 homes with both schemes due to be completed during 2018.
Our North West region also performed well.
We continue to build predominantly lowrise family housing on mediumscale sites around the Liverpool and Manchester conurbations and were operational on around 20 sites during 2017.
These included the delivery of 146 homes in partnership with Knowsley Metropolitan Borough Council 103 homes at Norris Green Village in Liverpool and 107 homes at Heyfields near Manchester during the year.
We were delighted with the performance of our West Midlands region following its launch in 2016.
At 30 September 2017 we had three open sales outlets in the region with 180 homes completed in the year.
While it is still early days in the West Midlands the pipeline continues to grow and we remain confident that we can replicate the successful model we have in the North West.
Across Partnerships we started on site on 30 new developments during the year.
In addition we had another very successful year in winning new business underpinning our longerterm growth plans.
In addition to those sites already in the land bank including those with preferred bidder status we secured 7030 new plots in the period including at Bilston Urban Village Wolverhampton Maidenhead Barking and Bromley.
We now have 19223 Partnerships plots under our control 2016 14504 plots.
These projects were awarded to Countryside as a result of our proven track record in delivering complex multiphase schemes alongside design excellence.
Overall we have visibility over approximately nine years supply at current volumes.
We had 23 open sales outlets as at 30 September 2017 2016 18 with a further 23 2016 20 sites under construction.
Outlook
As announced at the halfyear results in May 2017 our sustained momentum in particular regarding both the bid win rate and operational delivery has delivered a growth trajectory ahead of the original targets we set at IPO while continuing to win new business.
We have accelerated a number of Partnerships developments and our focus in 2018 is on new site starts with growth in all tenures including PRS homes.
During 2018 we are planning 42 new site starts within Partnerships 11 of which are large regeneration schemes around London.
At 30 September 2017 we were either bidding on or had identified as bid opportunities a further 40560 plots up approximately 20 per cent on the prior year.
A GENUINELY MIXED COMMUNITY BROOK VALLEY GARDENS REGENERATION IS A COMPLICATED PROCESS BUT IT CAN BE MADE EASIER WHEN WORKING WITH AN ORGANISATION SUCH AS COUNTRYSIDE.
Partnership with the London Borough of Barnet and LandQ Predominantly two and threestorey terraced houses with private gardens 631 highquality new homes across five development phases Target of 37 per cent affordable homes New community centre nursery and shared communal gardens The former Dollis Valley Estate had significant historical social challenges including petty crime and antisocial behaviour.
As part of our partnership with the council a key component of the regeneration was to use master planning to alleviate these problems and deliver a successful mixed community.
We started on site in September 2012 and the regeneration is already reconnecting the former estate.
Many of the existing tenants have already been rehoused in highquality affordable homes with a tenureblind approach to ensure quality and equity throughout the development.
Our approach integrates the housing tenures within the development creating a genuinely mixed community.
As the regeneration progresses we support local activities that bring an unprecedented sense of cohesion to the area.
Regeneration is a complicated process but it can be made easier when working with an organisation such as Countryside.
I have found their experience knowledge and listening skills exceptional.
They are always available to listen to residents comments and concerns and act upon them where possible.

In total we had 19826 plots within our Housebuilding land bank 2016 19322 of which only 27 per cent was owned outright with the rest controlled by either option agreements or conditional contracts.
This provides flexibility creates value through embedded discounts to open market value and enhances the efficiency of the balance sheet while still giving us strong visibility of future work.
Market
2017 was another positive year for the housebuilding sector with strong customer demand underpinned by the continuing structural shortage in housing.
The greatest demand continues to be from first time buyers and supported by Help to Buy.
We continue to focus on making sure that our homes remain affordable for local owneroccupiers who make up the vast majority of our private sales.
The second hand market continues to be more difficult resulting in slower sales rates for product above 600000 and in particular above 1m.
The Government focus on the National Planning Policy Framework continues to simplify the planning environment with initiatives such as a dispute resolution mechanism for Section 106 agreements.
This has facilitated an increase in outline planning consents although clearing prestart conditions remains challenging.
Our performance Our Housebuilding division experienced a step change in its scale during 2017 and is well on its way to achieving increased efficiency from greater scale.
T otal completions were up 53 per cent to 1197 homes compared with 783 homes in 2016.
As with the performance in the Partnerships division we saw strong growth in delivery of private homes up 68 per cent in the period to 837 homes 2016 499 homes.
In line with our plans to ensure our homes remain affordable the Housebuilding private ASP decreased by 23 per cent to 515000 in the period as we reduced our exposure to higher end product focusing on the areas where we see the strongest demand but also reflecting some slowing in reservation rates at the higher end.
Underlying sales values remained robust with house price inflation of four per cent offsetting build cost inflation during the period.

Countryside Properties PLC  Annual report 2017 Our Performance continued In certain locations where it is taking slightly longer to reposition higher product price points we have seen a slowing in net reservation rates albeit sales values were broadly in line with our expectations.
Demand for highquality locations and premium product has continued to be met by our Millgate brand.
The previously highlighted operational issues at Mill Hill continued to be a drag on the Housebuilding division with 67 homes completed in the year.
The development should be fully built by the end of the calendar year with 18 homes left to complete.
We have seen strong demand at Greenwich Millennium Village where we completed 122 homes Springhead Park Ebbsfleet where we completed 110 homes and Beaulieu Chelmsford where we completed 155 homes across four phases in the period.
We made good progress on delivery at our legacy sites at Kings Park Harold Wood and Horsted Park Chatham in the period delivering 217 units in total.
On our current plans both of these sites should be completed during 2019.
In line with our strategy we have maintained the land bank in our Housebuilding division acquiring 2896 plots on 16 sites during the year.
We completed four land sales during the period including a commercial sale at Cambridge Medipark a parcel of land at the site in Bicester where we are an associate partner and two residential sales at Bury St Edmunds and Silsden which we chose not to develop.

However we have a further 18 sites under construction to ensure we increase the number of selling outlets in 2018.
This gives us great visibility over delivery for 2018 which is set to be another year of strong growth in our Housebuilding division as we get closer to optimum scale.
All of our planned delivery for the next three years is identified and the majority over 75 per cent already has some form of planning.

Countryside Properties PLC  Annual report 2017 ANOTHER YEAR OF STRONG PERFORMANCE
Group Chief Financial Officers review
We have delivered another strong set of results with both divisions performing well and we are on track to deliver our growth objectives.
A combination of factors including the geographical mix of the business management of our pricing exposure and legacy issues at a Housebuilding site in Mill Hill London meant that our operating margin progress was modest during the year.
We made good progress with controlling overheads as a result of a number of initiatives including a small restructuring of Head Office functions in the first half which resulted in overheads falling further as a percentage of sales to 5.0 per cent 2016 5.9 per cent.
Overall adjusted operating margin increased by 20bps to 16.0 per cent 2016 15.8 per cent which contributed to a 34 per cent increase in adjusted operating profit to 164.1m 2016 122.5m.
Reported operating profit was up 48 per cent to 128.9m 2016 87.3m with the difference to adjusted operating profit being the proportionate consolidation of the Groups associate and joint ventures and a nonunderlying item relating to the restructuring costs referred to above.
Further details of the difference can be found in Note 6 to the financial statements.
Our net reservation rate per open sales outlet increased to 0.84 2016 0.78 which reflected continued strong demand for our homes with an increase in open sales outlets to 47 2016 43 helping to drive the increase in revenue.
We saw a moderation in sales rate immediately following the General Election in June but this reversed before year end with a normal summer trading pattern in 2017 compared to the very strong performance in August 2016.
A further 41 sites were under construction but not yet open for sale sustaining the production growth underpinning our mediumterm targets.
This growth in sales outlets when combined with our continued strong sales rate has not only increased completions but delivered a record yearend private forward order book up eight per cent to 242.4m 2016 225.4m.
Group performance 2017 was a year of substantial growth for the Group with total completions up 28 per cent to 3389 homes 2016 2657 homes.
We continued to manage down private ASP to moderate our exposure to higher price points which resulted in an eight per cent reduction in ASP to 430000 2016 465000.
Affordable ASP increased by 13 per cent to 135000 2016 120000 driven by the increasing use of shared ownership and lowcost housing by Registered Providers.
As a result the Group delivered adjusted revenue of 1028.8m 2016 777.0m up 32 per cent from last year as the Group passed the 1bn sales mark for the first time.
Statutory revenue increased by 26 per cent to 845.8m 2016 671.3m.
The difference between the adjusted and reported measures reflects the proportionate consolidation of the Groups associate and joint ventures.
We continued to see price growth during the year particularly at the lower price points and house price inflation for the full year was similar to the prior year at around five per cent.
During the year we saw cost price inflation moderate in London and the South East driven by some weakness in the London construction market.
Cost price inflation in the North West was higher although broadly consistent with the prior year.
Given the Groups forward purchasing for the 2018 financial year there is limited nearterm risk to margin from these trends.
Overall Group adjusted gross margin including the Groups share of associate and joint venture gross profit was 21.2 per cent slightly behind last years margin of 21.9 per cent as a result of the impact of the changing mix of the business towards the North West and a conscious management of our pricing in the South East.
We also experienced some modest reductions in selling price at premium price points in excess of 1m across the business.
Our legacy issues at a Housebuilding site in Mill Hill London also impacted gross margin in that division and we expect to conclude this development in the 2018 financial year.
Within this profit from land sales contributed 8.9m 2016 10.6m as we tactically sold parcels of land where we no longer expect to build and 5.6m 2016 5.9m from commercial sales again principally at the Medipark site in Cambridge where we sell serviced parcels of land for commercial use.
We ended the year with net cash of 77.4m 2016 12.0m slightly higher than planned due to the delayed start of two developments in our Partnerships division which will begin early in the new financial year.
As a result of the lower interest cost of our new facility and lower average debt levels during the year the Groups bank interest cost fell to 3.0m 2016 5.2m.
Despite a change to the discount rate applied to our land creditors and overage liabilities discussed in further detail below reported net finance costs decreased to 16.9m 2016 28.2m.
Partnerships
We began to see the results of our increased investments since IPO in our Partnerships division during 2017 with total completions up 17 per cent to 2192 homes 2016 1874 homes.
With private Strategic report Governance Financial statements Countryside Properties PLC  Annual report 2017 ASP increasing 12 per cent to 343000 2016 307000 and affordable ASP up nine per cent to 121000 2016 111000 adjusted revenue increased 36 per cent to 476.7m 2016 349.9m.
Private completions of 825 homes were up 31 per cent on the prior year 2016 628 homes as key developments at St Pauls Square Bow and East City Point Canning T own delivered a full year of production.
We were also able to begin the acceleration of our Acton London development using the proceeds raised at IPO in February 2016 and made good progress in our first year of delivery from our new West Midlands region based in Wolverhampton.
We were actively selling on 23 outlets at 30 September 2017 2016 18.
Affordable completions were up 10 per cent at 1367 homes 2016 1246 homes.
These affordable completions included the delivery of PRS housing principally from our ongoing partnership with Sigma Capital in the North West and West Midlands of 721 homes 2016 738.
The adjusted gross margin for the Partnerships division was 20.6 per cent slightly behind the 21.3 per cent delivered last year due to the increased proportion of sales from the North Wes t and West Midlands regions compared to last year.
As we benefited from the scaling up of our business adjusted operating margin increased to 16.7 per cent 2016 16.2 per cent.
As a result of the increased volume and improved operating margin adjusted operating profit of 79.4m was up 40 per cent 2016 56.8m.
On a reported basis Partnerships revenue increased to 418.8m up 34 per cent 2016 313.2m as a result of the growth in sales outlets delivering a greater number of completions along with an increase in ASP.
Reported Partnerships operating profit increased to 68.7m 2016 52.4m.
We had another very successful year in winning new business in the Partnerships division underpinning our longerterm growth plans.
In addition to those sites already in the land bank including those with preferred bidder status we secured 7030 new plots in the period.
We now have 19223 Partnerships plots under our control 2016 14504 plots.
This represents approximately nine years supply at current volumes and provides significant visibility.
Housebuilding
The increased production which started in 2016 together with strong customer demand at the sub 600000 level allowed us to significantly increase completions up 53 per cent to 1197 homes 2016 783 homes.
T otal adjusted revenue from Housebuilding was up 29 per cent to 552.1m 2016 427.1m.
Private completions increased by 68 per cent to 837 homes 2016 499 homes.
With the high rate of sales we sold out on a number of sites during the year resulting in open sales outlets at the year end down one at 24 2016 25.
With an additional 18 active sites in production we anticipate a material increase in open selling outlets by the end of the 2018 financial year.
Private ASP of 515000 was 23 per cent lower than last year 2016 665000.
This reduction was driven in part by our decision to manage price points down to focus on the market below 600000 where demand remains strongest but also some reductions in sales rates at premium price points over 1m.
Despite these pressures at the upper end of the market volumes have remained in line with our expectations and ahead of 2016.
Affordable revenue increased by 47 per cent to 65.7m 2016 44.6m with completions up 27 per cent to 360 2016 284 at an ASP of 183000 2016 157000 up 17 per cent.
Housebuilding adjusted gross margin was 21.6 per cent 2016 22.4 per cent a reduction of 80bps driven by delayed completions at our joint venture with Annington Developments Limited at Mill Hill in North London together with some pressure at higher price points.
Operating costs reduced as a percentage of turnover as our operating regions reached scale and we saw the benefit of operational gearing which together resulted in a 70bps increase in adjusted operating margin to 16.6 per cent 2016 15.9 per cent.
Overall the Housebuilding adjusted operating profit increased by 34 per cent to 91.5m 2016 68.1m.
On a reported basis Housebuilding revenue increased by 19 per cent to 427.0m 2016 358.1m with growth coming from the increased average number of open sales outlets and house price growth.
Reported
Housebuilding operating profit increased to 68.6m 2016 49.8m.
In line with our strategy we have maintained the land bank in our Housebuilding division and have acquired 2896 plots on 16 sites during the period.
The Housebuilding land bank now stands at 19826 plots 2016 19322 plots of which 83 per cent has been strategically sourced.
Nonunderlying items In the first half of the year certain Group operations were restructured principally the outsourcing of architecture and design services.
As a result of this a number of people left the Group at a cost of 1.6m.
From 1 April 2017 the discount rate applied to committed land payments recognised as land creditors or overage was reduced from 6.0 per cent to 3.4 per cent.

Taxation
The Group published its tax strategy for the first time in 2017 as part of its approach to maintaining an open and transparent relationship with tax stakeholders including HMRC.
The Group continues to hold a lowrisk tax rating.
The strategy confirms the Groups view that it seeks to comply fully with its statutory and other regulatory obligations and to act in a way which upholds its reputation as a responsible corporate citizen including full and transparent disclosure to tax authorities.
In line with Countrysides broader corporate strategy the key goals directing our tax strategy are adherence to applicable laws and regulations maximisation of shareholder value on a sustainable basis and protection of our reputation and brand.
We believe that our obligation is to pay the amount of tax legally due at the right time in accordance with rules set by the relevant authorities.
We also have a responsibility to shareholders to ensure that strategic business objectives are met without incurring unnecessary tax costs.
The income tax charge was 24.1m 2016 17.3m with an adjusted tax rate of 18.5 per cent 2016 21.8 per cent and on a reported basis an effective tax rate of 17.0 per cent 2016 22.0 per cent.
The adjusted rate has reduced due to a reduction in disallowable expenditure during the year due to the IPO transaction costs and the redemption of mandatory redeemable preference shares in the prior year.

Earnings per share EPS Adjusted basic earnings per share increased by 71 per cent to 27.8 pence 2016 16.3 pence reflecting the increase in adjusted operating profit during the year together with a decrease in adjusted net finance costs and a lower adjusted effective tax rate.

Basic earnings per share was 26.0 pence 2016 13.6 pence.
Basic earnings per share is lower than adjusted basic earnings per share due to the effect of nonunderlying items that are excluded from adjusted results.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Countryside Properties PLC  Annual report 2017
The Board has recommended a final dividend of 5.0 pence per share 2016 3.4 pence per share representing a payout of 30 per cent of adjusted profit after tax.
This brings the total dividend for 2017 to 8.4 pence per share 2016 3.4 pence per share.
This will be paid on 9 February 2018 to shareholders on the Register of Members at the close of business on 22 December 2017 subject to approval by shareholders at the AGM.
The proposed final dividend was recommended by the Board on 21 November 2017 and as such has not been included as a liability as at 30 September 2017.
In 2018 Countryside intends that the dividend will continue to represent 30 per cent of adjusted profit after tax.
Statement of financial position As at 30 September 2017 TNAV was 627.0m 2016 537.4m an increase of 89.6m which was mainly attributable to retained earnings after the payment of the Groups dividends during the year.
As we continued to grow the business inventory grew by 83.5m to 667.1m 2016 583.6m as we were active on 88 sites at 30 September 2017 2016 72 sites.
Investments in associate and joint ventures were maintained at 61.4m 2016 59.1m as Oaklands Hamlet in Chigwell Essex reached maturity as an open selling outlet.
Improving returns During the year a significant focus on working capital efficiency and cash generation saw asset turn defined as adjusted revenue divided by average TNAV excluding net cash or debt increase to 1.9 times 2016 1.7 times.
This together with the adjusted operating margin improvements helped our return on capital employed increase by 370bps to 30.5 per cent 2016 26.8 per cent.
This is 250bps ahead of our mediumterm ROCE target and is in part driven by the high level of cash on the balance sheet at 30 September which was the result of two delayed starts on site in our Partnerships division which will take place in the first half of the 2018 financial year.

Financing
On 3 May 2017 the Group signed a oneyear extension to its 300m revolving credit facility agreement.
The agreement has a variable interest rate based on LIBOR and now expires in May 2022 although the Group has the opportunity to extend the term of the facility by a further year on the next anniversary.
A number of other changes to the facility in May 2017 have given the Group greater flexibility particularly in driving the scale of the Partnerships division.

Impact of the new revenue accounting standard During the second half the Group has undertaken a detailed exercise to determine whether the new revenue accounting standard IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers will have a material impact on the Groups results.
The new standard is effective for the Group for the 2019 financial year commencing on 1 October 2018.
This exercise is substantially complete and we have not yet identified any areas of our business where we will see material changes to the way in which we currently recognise revenue.
We are working with advisors and others in the industry to determine the appropriate treatment for the recognition of revenue on land sales to Registered Providers of social housing and await further guidance on this matter from the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee at their meeting in November 2017.
We expect to reach a conclusion on this in the first half of the 2018 financial year.

Risk management
OPTIMISING OUR
RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS
Risk management
How we manage risk Risk identification and management is built into every aspect of Countrysides daily operations ranging from the appraisal of new sites assessment of the prospects of planning success building safely and selling effectively to achieve longterm success through the property market cycle.
Risk management is built into standardised processes for each part of the business at every stage of the housebuilding process.
Financial risk is managed centrally through maintenance of a strong balance sheet forward selling new homes and the careful allocation of funds to the right projects at the right time and in the right locations.
Risk management also includes the internal controls described within the Corporate Governance Report on pages 46 to 51.
The Risk Management Committee normally meets every quarter to review the Groups risk register.
The Groups risk register is maintained to record all principal risks and uncertainties identified in each part of the business.
A member of the Executive Committee is allocated as appropriate as the risk owner for each risk.
The risk owners call upon the appropriate expertise to conduct an analysis of each risk according to a defined set of assessment criteria which includes How does the risk relate to the Groups business model andor strategy What is the likelihood of the risk occurring What is the potential impact were the risk to occur Would the consequences be short medium or longterm What mitigating actions are available and which are cost effective What is the degree of residual risk and is it within the Groups risk appetite parameters Has the risk assessment changed and what is expected to change going forward The Risk Management Committee reviews the assessments made compares it to the Groups appetite for each risk reviews the current level of preparedness and determines whether further actions or resource are required.
In reviewing and agreeing the mitigating actions the Risk Management Committee considers the impact of risks individually and in combination in both the short and the longerterm.
Role and responsibilities Determines the appropriate controls for the timely identification and management of risk Manages the Groups risk register Monitors the effective implementation of action plans Reviews reports from the Internal Audit function

This section describes how these risks are identified managed and mitigated appropriately in order to deliver the Groups strategic objectives.
Our approach to risk Strategic report Governance Financial statements Countryside Properties PLC  Annual report 2017 Viability Statement The following statement is made in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code April 2016 provision C.2.2.
After considering the current position of the Company the Directors have assessed the prospects and viability of the Company over a threeyear period to September 2020.
In making this statement the Board has performed a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Company including those risks that would threaten Countrysides business model future performance solvency or liquidity.
The principal risks facing Countryside and how the Company addresses such risks are described in this Strategic Report and are summarised in the Principal risks and uncertainties section of this report.
Although longerterm forecasts are prepared to support the strategic planning process the nature of the risks and opportunities faced by the Group limits the Directors ability to reliably predict the longer term.
Accordingly a threeyear horizon is used to allow for a greater degree of certainty in our assumptions.
The Directors assessment includes a financial review which is derived from the Groups strategic forecasts and identifies divisional business performance expected cash flows net debt headroom and funding covenant compliance throughout the three years under review.
These forecasts also incorporate severe but plausible downside case scenarios illustrating the potential impact upon viability of one or more of the Groups principal risks crystallising during the period both individually and in combination.
A number of reasonable assumptions are included within these assessments including the assumption that the Groups debt facility which expires in 2022 will continue to be available on the same or similar basis throughout the period under review the assumption that following a material event the Group would adjust its strategy accordingly to preserve cash.
This would include inter alia suspending the purchase of land changing the build profile of existing developments or adjusting Group dividend policy the assumption that counterparties including local authorities and housing associations honoured the phased viability terms and conditions contained in a number of the Groups Partnerships contracts and the assumption that the Group will be able to effectively mitigate risks through enacted or available actions as described in the Principal risks and uncertainties section of this report.
The sensitivity analysis is performed based on assumptions modelled on the 2007 to 2009 period adjusted for changes in Countrysides business divisions during which the Housebuilding sector saw significant reductions in sales rates and average selling prices and illiquidity in the land market during a prolonged economic recession.
These assumptions include inter alia a 20 per cent fall in house prices and an up to 50 per cent reduction in sales rates offset by a 10 per cent build cost deflation.
It considers all of our principal risks although our assumption that we will be able to effectively mitigate some of our risks leads to a greater emphasis on those risks that are beyond our control such as external macroeconomic factors.
Having had due regard to the sensitivity analysis the Directors have concluded that we do not face a risk to our viability except in the event of highly improbable combinations of material events within the threeyear window.
Based on this conclusion the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of the assessment.
Ian Sutcliffe Group Chief Executive 21 November 2017 Key areas of focus during 2017 Data protection Given that the EUs General Data Protection Regulation GDPR takes effect from 25 May 2018 the businesswide objective of ensuring all business divisions are in compliance in advance of the deadline has been overseen by the Risk Management Committee during 2017.
The process commenced with an internal audit of the Groups state of readiness followed by the development and implementation of an operational road map using the findings of the audit to embrace GDPR and develop sustainable privacy with respect to Countrysides employees customers and suppliers.

Market
The Board Executive Committee and Risk Management Committee have spent considerable time during 2017 to ensure that the Groups mixedtenure approach and product mix are best suited to ensure we maintain affordability and serve the areas of strongest demand.
In order to better monitor potential changes in market risk management has expanded the range of third party data it reviews such as the monthly Barclays UK spend trend and increased the use of third party market assessments in advance of all major new projects.

Current assessment of principal risks
Impact
Unlikely Occasional Likely Low Moderate Significant Premitigation Postmitigation 2 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Countryside Properties PLC  Annual report 2017 RISK DESCRIPTION MITIGATION Inability to source and develop suitable land Competition or poor planning may result in a failure to procure land in the right location at the right price and at the right time.
Inability to attract and retain talented employees Inability to attract and retain highly skilled competent people at all levels could adversely affect the Groups results prospects and financial condition.
Inadequate health safety and environmental procedures A deterioration in the Groups health safety and environmental standards could put the Groups employees contractors or the general public at risk of injury or death and could lead to litigation or penalties or damage the Groups reputation.
A robust land appraisal process ensures each project is financially viable and consistent with the Groups strategy.
Remuneration packages are regularly benchmarked against industry standards to ensure competitiveness.
Succession plans are in place for all key roles within the Group.
Exit interviews are used to identify any areas for improvement.
Procedures training and reporting are all carefully monitored to ensure that high standards are maintained.
An environmental risk assessment is carried out prior to any land acquisition.
Appropriate insurance is in place to cover the risks associated with housebuilding.
Constraints on construction resources Costs may increase beyond budget due to the reduced availability of skilled labour or shortages of subcontractors or building materials at competitive prices to support the Groups growth ambitions.
The Groups strategic geographic expansion may be at risk if new supply chains cannot be established.
Programme delay rising project complexity Failure to secure timely planning permission on economically viable terms or poor project forecasting unforeseen operational delays due to technical issues disputes with third party contractors or suppliers bad weather or changes in purchaser requirements may cause delay or potentially termination of project.
Optimise use of standard house types and design to maximise buying power.
Use of strategic suppliers to leverage volume price reductions and minimise unforeseen disruption.
Robust contract terms to control costs.
The budgeted programme for each site is approved by the Divisional Board before acquisition.
Sites are managed as a portfolio to control overall Group delivery risk.
Weekly monitoring at both divisional and Group level.
LINK TO STRATEGY
Note
The Risk Management Committees review of risk including the principal risks takes into account the known and forecast developments flowing from plans being made for the UKs planned exit from membership of the European Union by March 2019 Brexit.
Brexit affects many of the principal risks but particularly those marked with an asterisk.
CHANGE
DURING YEAR Countryside Properties PLC  Annual report 2017 COMMITTED TO GOOD GOVERNANCE Chairmans introduction to governance Supporting implementation of the business strategy The Board has been heavily involved in monitoring and supporting the implementation across the Group of the strategy outlined during Countrysides initial public offering in February 2016.
Much progress has been made in 2017 with the further development of our Housebuilding and Partnerships business divisions including a number of changes to our Executive Committee as shown on pages 44.
This has resulted in a diverse and experienced executive team to drive the performance of those business divisions.
As set out on pages 50 and 51 the Board has combined a number of Board meetings with site visits at which we received presentations from the Regional Managing Directors and their respective teams.
Our site visits and the discussions between NonExecutives and members of the divisional teams have helped to inform our view of the success and the challenges of the implementation of the Groups strategy.
Implementing succession planning for the Board and Executive Committee Led by our Nomination Committee we are focused on ensuring that our talent pipeline is managed to support the Groups strategy.
During 2017 we have assisted the executive management in identifying and appointing candidates for the Executive Committee and other senior management roles and I am delighted with the appointments we have made which add significantly to the diversity in skills background and experience at senior management level.
Biographies of our Executive Committee members can be found on page 44 and my Nomination Committee Report on page 56 gives further detail about our input into the appointment process.
The Board has continued to support and review the success of our leadership development programmes.
We are confident that these our talent pipeline and other initiatives such as our two female NonExecutive Directors talking about their careers and overcoming challenges with the senior women within the business mean that we are well set to continue our success in developing internal staff into diverse and experienced managers of the future.
Succession planning for the Board and Committees has also been on the Nomination Committees agenda particularly given the Board changes as a result of Oaktree Capital Managements Oaktree share sell down.
Again more detail on our succession planning activity can be found in the Nomination Committee Report on page 56.
Dear Shareholders This report sets out our approach to governance and how our governance framework supported our activities throughout the year.
The Board regards corporate governance as a core and vital discipline complementing our desire to continually improve upon the success of the Group on behalf of our shareholders.
Our governance framework described in this report allows for the continued monitoring review development and implementation of the policies procedures and culture that support our high governance standards.
The success of our strategy is very much dependent on developing a culture across the Group that supports the implementation of our strategy.
I am pleased to report that our boardroom culture is good with constructive challenge flowing freely from the NonExecutive Directors underpinned by a genuine sense of mutual respect between all Directors.
This has been borne out by our performance evaluation process for 2017 the results of which are described on page 48.
During 2017 the principal areas of focus for the Board have been supporting implementation of the business strategy implementing succession planning for the Board and Executive Committee improving the management of risk to support implementation of the Groups strategic goals developing policies and procedures to address the new Consumer Code for Home Builders and preparing for the introduction of the Criminal Finances Act and the General Data Protection Regulation.
We have made good progress against all of these areas of focus in the year.
Improving the management of risk to support implementation of the Groups strategic goals Risk management and in particular the principal risks faced by the Group are key elements of the Boards ongoing agenda and have been in particular focus this year as we monitor the housebuilding market and related issues following the UKs vote in June 2016 to leave the European Union.
Details of our principal risks and uncertainties are set out on pages 38 and 39.
Our IT governance and security were strengthened during 2017 and security generally but particularly cyber security has remained high on our agenda in 2017.
The Group has completed a thorough risk assessment of information security during the year with regular reports on progress considered by the Audit Committee.
Other activities in 2017 Health and safety A focus on health and safety processes is critical for our business.
Health and safety KPIs are reviewed by the Board regularly.
Our approach to health and safety including a description of the metrics by which we measure our health and safety performance are described in detail on page 34.
The Board published its first statement under Section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act on the Groups website in November 2016 setting out the steps we have taken during the year to ensure that our operations and supply chains are free from trafficking and slavery.
The second statement which includes further improvements made during 2017 to combat modern slavery was published on the Groups website in October 2017.
Meeting our major shareholders We have developed a comprehensive investor relations programme with our Executive Directors meeting investors and analysts regularly supported where appropriate by me and other members of the Board.
Our investor relations programme which is described on page 50 is supported by Victoria Prior who we appointed as Director of Investor Relations in November 2015.
We have carried out a series of shareholder engagement events during 201617 as shown on page 41.
We again received positive feedback for each event and see them as a valuable opportunity to understand the views of and develop constructive relationships with our major shareholders.
Corporate governance is a core and vital discipline to the success of the Group.
Financial statements Countryside Properties PLC  Annual report 2017 Governance Strategic report The Board On 26 May 2017 we announced that Oaktree had completed a sale of shares in Countryside reducing its remaining shareholding in Countryside to approximately 23 per cent of the Companys issued share capital.
As required by the Relationship Agreement with Oaktree as described on page 49 James Van Steenkiste stepped down from the Board on 5 June 2017.
On 2 October 2017 we announced that Richard Adam had notified the Company of his decision to step down as a NonExecutive Director Chairman of the Audit Committee and Senior Independent Director of the Company with his last day of service being 31 December 2017.
The
Board has commenced a formal search for his replacement and a further announcement will be made as soon as the details and commencement date of Richards successor have been agreed.
On behalf of the Board I would like to thank James and Richard for their valuable contributions to Countryside since joining the Board.
I would also like to thank my remaining colleagues on the Board for their continued support commitment challenge and passion for our business.
Independence of Directors The Board reviewed the independence of all NonExecutive Directors excluding the Chairman at the Board meeting on 27 July 2017 and determined that they all continue to be independent with the exception of Federico Canciani who holds the position of Managing Director at Oaktree Capital Management UK Limited a substantial shareholder of the Company.
The Board is satisfied that the Chairman was independent upon appointment.
Board and Committee effectiveness In 2017 a Board and Committee evaluation was carried out.
The decision was made to conduct an internal review led by me and assisted by the Company Secretary.
An externally facilitated review will be organised next year.
I am delighted to confirm that no significant issues were raised and the view of the Board is that the governance structure together with the Board and its Committees all continue to operate effectively with a positive and open culture.
The review process is described in more detail on page 48.
I am satisfied that the NonExecutive Directors continue to be effective and show a high level of commitment to their roles.
All Directors with the exception of Richard Adam given his departure will as they will every year stand for reelection at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
David Howell
21 November 2017 Compliance with the Code From 5 June 2017 until 30 September 2017 Countryside has complied with all the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2016 the Code.
Richard Adam will remain as the Senior Independent NonExecutive Director the Chairman of the Audit Committee and a member of both the Remuneration and Nomination Committees until his last day of service to the Company on 31 December 2017.
During this time Countryside will remain compliant with all provisions of the Code.
In planning for Richard Adams succession the Nomination Committee has instigated a formal search for his replacement with the intention that his successor take on the role of Senior Independent NonExecutive Director Chairman of the Audit Committee and join both the Remuneration and Nomination Committees.
If Richard Adams successor is appointed prior to 31 December 2017 and there are no other changes to the Board composition Countryside will remain compliant with all provisions of the Code.
Prior to 5 June 2017 Countryside complied with all the provisions of the Code save that excluding the independent NonExecutive Chairman the Board had only three NonExecutive Directors which it considered to be independent.
This constituted noncompliance with Code provision B.1.2 that recommends at least half the Board excluding the Chairman comprises independent NonExecutive Directors.
Nonetheless as reported in our previous Annual Report the Board determined that the composition of the Board comprising two Executive Directors and six NonExecutive Directors brought a desirable range of skills and experience in light of the Companys challenges and opportunities following admission to the London Stock Exchange while at the same time ensuring that no individual or small group of individuals could dominate the Boards decision making.
Oaktree currently has one NonExecutive Director appointed to the Board following James Van Steenkiste stepping down on 5 June 2017 after Oaktrees reduction of its shareholding in the Company to below 25 per cent.
As and when Oaktree reduces its shareholding below 10 per cent its right to make Board appointments ceases.

This decision was subsequently approved by the Board.
The Committee determined the scope of internal audit activity for the 2017 financial year and reviewed the findings of audits performed during the year.
The Committee also ensured that recommendations for internal control improvements were being implemented by management on a timely basis.
The Committee continued to monitor the integrity of the Groups financial statements including the key judgements and estimates applied by management and scrutinised the scope performance and effectiveness of the external audit process.

Details of attendance at the Audit Committee meetings during the 2017 financial year are set out on page 53.
Internal controls The Board assisted by the Audit Committee is responsible for regularly reviewing the operation and effectiveness of the Groups internal controls.
The internal control system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material errors losses or fraud.
The Board is also responsible for ensuring that appropriate systems are in place to enable it to identify assess and manage key risks.
The financial reporting process and control system which includes the preparation of the consolidated financial statements is monitored and maintained through the use of internal control frameworks which address key financial reporting risks including risks arising from changes in the business or accounting standards.
Effectiveness is assessed through selfcertification and independent testing of the controls.
Whistleblowing
The Groups whistleblowing policy is supported by an external helpline.
All cases of whistleblowing are investigated by the Company Secretary and the results of any investigations are reported to the Audit Committee.
The Committee is satisfied that the policy and its administration remain effective.
Risk management
The successful management of risk is critical to achieving Countrysides strategic objectives.
The Board has delegated responsibility for reviewing and maintaining effective risk management systems and internal controls to the Audit Committee.
Daytoday management of the Groups risk management framework is conducted by the Risk Management Committee.
Its membership and role are detailed on page 47.
Financial statements Countryside Properties PLC  Annual report 2017 Governance Strategic report The Board reviews the Group risk register annually with the last review occurring on 16 October 2017.
In managing risk we analyse the nature and extent of risks and consider their likelihood and impact both on an inherent and a residual basis after taking account of mitigating controls.
This allows us to determine how we should manage each risk in order to achieve our strategic objectives.
At the quarterly meetings of the Risk Management Committee management discusses the key risks along with the mitigating action plans.
Following sign off by the Executive Committee the output of this review is presented to the Audit Committee.
The Groups key risk management procedures have been in place throughout 2017 and up to the date of approval of this Annual Report.
Overview of risk management process Internal control The Groups key internal control procedures include the following review of the Groups strategy and the performance of principal subsidiaries through a comprehensive system of reporting based on variances to annual budgets key performance indicators and regular forecasting a quarterly business review for each business division.
This covers financial performance a detailed range of strategic risks opportunities and KPI metrics which measure the overall performance of the business sector.
This process also identifies the key operational issues and actions required to address any deficiencies well defined Group policies and processes communicated through the Group Financial Reporting Procedures Manual and the intranet and a defined process governing the approval of sales opportunities and capital expenditure a defined organisational structure with appropriate delegation of authority across all levels of the organisation formal authorisation procedures for all investments with clear guidelines on appraisal techniques and success criteria and formal authorisation procedures for all significant sales opportunities and bid management with clear guidelines on success criteria and contracting practices.
The Audit Committee has on behalf of the Board conducted an annual review of the effectiveness of the Groups internal control systems for 2017 and the period prior to approval of this Annual Report.
The Audit Committee Chairman reported its findings to the Board at the 20 November 2017 Board meeting.
It considered all material controls in accordance with the Turnbull guidance.
Following this review no significant weaknesses or failings were identified and noted improvement areas are being addressed by management.
The internal control environment will continue to be monitored and reviewed by the Board and the Audit Committee.
Fair balanced and understandable At the request of the Board the Audit Committee considered whether the 2017 Annual Report was fair balanced and understandable and whether it provided the necessary information for the shareholders to assess the Groups performance business model and strategy.
The Audit Committee took into account its own knowledge of the Group its strategy and performance in the year and comprehensive reviews undertaken at different levels in the Group to ensure consistency and overall balance.
A similar detailed review undertaken by senior management and the results of the external audit were also taken into account by the Audit Committee.
Prior to the publication of both the interim and fullyear results for the Group the Audit Committee undertook a detailed assessment of the appropriateness of the adoption by the Group of the going concern basis in the preparation of the financial statements.
For further information in respect of going concern please refer to the Directors Report on pages 74 to 76.
Shortly before publication of the fullyear financial results for 2017 the Audit Committee undertook a detailed assessment of the Viability Statement and recommended to the Board that the Directors can believe that they have a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the threeyear period of their assessment.
For the detailed Viability Statement please refer to our risk section on page 37 of the Strategic Report.
Internal Audit The work performed by Deloitte which performed Internal Audit services throughout the year focused on areas of greatest risk to the Group including those matters identified through the risk management framework and any significant change projects occurring within the business.
The objective of Internal Audit is to provide independent assurance to the Audit Committee over the financial operational and compliance controls and to assist the Audit Committee in its assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls.
Internal Audit reports directly to the Group Chief Financial Officer but has the right to report to the Audit Committee Chairman independently of the Executive Directors.
All significant Internal Audit reports are reviewed by the Executive Committee and the Audit Committee and all reports are made available to the external auditor.
During the year the Audit Committee approved the internal audit plan reviewed the findings from audits and monitored the followup of actions identified in audits.
Oversight of the external audit Following a tender for external audit and auditrelated services in 2016 the Audit Committee and Board selected PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
PwCs appointment was approved by shareholders at the 2017 AGM.
The
Committees oversight of the external auditor includes reviewing and approving the annual audit plan.
In reviewing the plan the Committee discusses and challenges the auditors assessment of materiality and financial reporting risk areas most likely to give rise to material error.
PwC reported to the Board and confirmed its independence in accordance with ethical standards and that it had maintained appropriate internal safeguards to ensure its independence and objectivity.
The Committee considered the findings of the FRCs Audit Quality Review AQR teams report into the conduct of PwC audits generally.
In addition the AQR team selected to review the audit of the Groups 2016 financial statements as part of its annual inspection of audit firms.
The chairman of the Committee received a copy of the findings of the AQR team and has discussed this with PwC.
Whilst there were no significant findings some areas of PwCs audit procedures were identified as requiring improvement and we are satisfied with the responses implemented by PwC in the audit of the Groups 2017 financial statements.
None of the findings related to the Groups accounting policies.
Committee attendance The number of Audit Committee meetings attended by each member during the 2017 financial year is as follows

The Audit Committee has received a report at each meeting describing the extent of such services provided by PwC.
The award of nonaudit services to the Companys external auditor is subject to controls agreed by the Audit Committee to monitor and maintain the objectivity and independence of the external auditor.
In order to comply with the Ethical Standard for Auditors the Audit Committee considered and reapproved the Groups policy for auditor independence and the provision of nonaudit services at its meeting on 3 October 2017.
The policy provides details of permitted prohibited and auditrelated services in accordance with the Ethical Standard.
Services including inter alia those relating to taxation internal audit the design or implementation of internal controls and HR services are prohibited.

Where the services are not clearly trivial or where the cumulative fee in the financial year exceeds 100000 preapproval is required from the Audit Committee.
Further Audit Committee approval is required when nonaudit fees reach 70 per cent of the average audit fees over the last three years although this cap will not formally apply to the Group until the financial year beginning on 1 October 2019.

SECURITY REVIEW ENSURING THAT THE GROUPS INFORMATION IS SECURE AND MANAGED CORRECTLY HAS BEEN A KEY FOCUS IN 2017.
As part of Countrysides review of risk management a thorough information security review was conducted between 28 June and 13 July 2017.
Overseen by the Groups IT Management Committee the project was led by the Group IT Director with the support of our security partners Saepio and Pen T est Partners.
The review consisted of an internal and external penetration test followed by an ISO 27001 audit.
A presentation of the results was made to the Board on 27 July 2017 and a detailed roadmap of improvements is being put in place with the support of our security partners and the Board.
An internal audit by Deloitte to confirm the Groups assessment of cyber risk readiness was carried out in October with the results reviewed by the Executive Committee and the Audit Committee during November 2017.
Financial statements Countryside Properties PLC  Annual report 2017 Governance Strategic report Annual evaluation of Audit Committee performance As part of the overall Board evaluation process the Audit Committee reviewed its effectiveness during 2017.
This evaluation considered areas such as its composition its effectiveness in reviewing the work of the internal and external auditors and the Groups internal control systems the quality of reporting and the management of risk.
No significant issues were raised and the Audit Committee concluded that it continues to operate effectively.
Areas of significant judgement considered by the Audit Committee in 2017 The Audit Committee considered the following matters in respect of the Groups financial statements based upon its interaction with both management and the external auditor during the year.
Significant matters considered Our response to these matters Estimation of site profitability As disclosed in Note 1 to the financial statements gross profit is recognised as homes are sold based on a profit margin for the development taken as a whole.
Calculating this margin includes forecasting revenue and costs for the development as well as allocating land and infrastructure costs on a prorata basis.
Profit recognition in relation to commercial land transactions can be subjective and dependent on contractual terms.
The accuracy of allocation is monitored at Board level via the monthly management accounts and quarterly forecasts with any judgements being discussed with the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee has reviewed and approved the Groups accounting policy in relation to profit recognition.
The external auditor regularly examines the allocation of revenue and costs as a routine part of the external audit and no significant issues have been identified in this regard.
Carrying value of inventory Inventory is material to the Groups balance sheet and there is a risk that the carrying value will exceed its net realisable value particularly in challenging market conditions.
Management regularly reviews the carrying value of all sites under development and other inventory such as undeveloped land.
These reviews have regard to the latest cash flow forecasts for the relevant development or land parcel and comparable market valuations for land where applicable.
The Audit Committee considered managements review of the carrying value of inventory and the appropriateness of the level of provisions held.
The external auditor reported on this matter to the Audit Committee at the halfyear review and again for the final audit.
The Audit Committee was satisfied that the carrying value of inventory is appropriate.
Carrying value of shared equity loans The Groups shared equity loan portfolio is held at fair value as an available forsale financial asset.
The fair value is calculated using a discounted cash flow forecast based on likely future redemptions and defaults taking into account future house price inflation and discounted using an interest rate equivalent to a second charge mortgage.
Management reviews the carrying value regularly and takes into account third party evidence where available.
The Audit Committee reviewed the fair value methodology and the assumptions applied in determining the fair value of the shared equity portfolio and has agreed that the carrying value is appropriate.
The valuation methodology has also been audited by the external auditor.
Viability Statement testing The Viability Statement testing performed by management was based on the latest available threeyear forecast.
T o ensure that the financial position of the Group was robust downside sensitivity testing was performed by applying a range of overlays including reduced sales rates and average selling prices a reduction in land sales and reduced affordable housing sales.
We also included operational inefficiency downsides including delays to the delivery of key sites and enhanced cost inflation.
Each of the above assumptions was based on managements assumption of a reasonable downside outcome.
The Audit Committee reviewed the assumptions applied by management in arriving at the conclusion on the Groups viability and agreed that they were reasonable.
Presentation of nonunderlying items During the year the Group presented certain restructuring costs and the impact of a change in the discount rate applied to deferred land and overage payments as nonunderlying items and excluded them from adjusted profit measures.
Having discussed the presentation of these items outside adjusted profit with the external auditor the Committee accepted managements view that the costs presented as nonunderlying items were nonrecurring in nature and that it was appropriate to present them outside adjusted profit.
The Committee expects that the presentation of items outside adjusted profit will be infrequent.

The details of the Groups Executive Director and NonExecutive Director remuneration for the financial year including the operation of the Groups incentive plans and payments made under them will be set out each year in an Annual Report on Remuneration contained in the Groups Annual Report as required by the Regulations.
The table below sets out the key elements of the policy for Executive Directors including the rationale for their use and details of their operation Countryside Properties PLC  Annual report 2017 Notes to the policy table For the avoidance of doubt in approving this Directors remuneration policy at the 2017 AGM authority was given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into previously with Directors.
Malus and clawback The circumstances in which malus and clawback may apply include a material misstatement of the Companys accounts error in assessment of performance or calculation of the number of awards individual gross misconduct or conduct resulting in reputational damage to the Group.
Performance measures and targets The short and longterm incentive plans have a number of different financial performance measures aligned to the performance of the Company.
Targets will be set with reference to prior year performance budget and brokers forecasts and other external market expectations.
Performance targets will be set so as to be achievable but representing stretching performance for the business.
Annual bonus performance metrics are determined at the start of each financial year based on the key business priorities for the year ahead.
The majority will be linked to a profit metric as this is the primary indicator of our sustainable growth.
The target ranges for the measures used in the annual bonus scheme are considered to be commercially sensitive at the start of the financial year and prospective disclosure is not in the interest of shareholders.
Other than in exceptional circumstances where elements remain commercially sensitive actual targets performance achieved and awards made will be published at the end of the performance periods so shareholders can fully assess the basis for any payouts.
LTIP metrics are determined at the time of grant with performance measures selected to support the Companys longterm strategy.
Future metrics will align our longterm goal of value creation for shareholders through strong underlying financial growth.
It is intended that awards under the December 2017 grant will be made on the same basis as the two existing awards using TNAV ROCE and relative TSR as the performance measures.
Discretion
The Remuneration Committee retains discretion over certain elements of the policy as set out in the report including the operation of the variable incentive schemes.
The Committee may adjust elements of the plans including but not limited to participation the timing of the grant of award andor payment the size of an award up to plan limits andor payment in exceptional circumstances to grant andor settle an LTIP award in cash discretion relating to the measurement of performance in the event of a change of control determination of a good leaver in addition to any specified categories for incentive plan purposes adjustments required in certain circumstances e. performance conditions.
Should any such discretion be exercised an explanation would be provided in the following Annual Report on Remuneration and may be subject to shareholder consultation as appropriate.
NonExecutive Director remuneration policy The Board as a whole is responsible for setting the remuneration of the NonExecutive Directors other than the Chairman whose remuneration is determined by the Committee and recommended to the Board.
The table below sets out the key elements of the policy for NonExecutive Directors Objective Link to strategy Operation Maximum potential value Fees Core element of remuneration set at a level sufficient to attract and retain individuals with appropriate knowledge and experience in organisations of broadly similar size and complexity.
Fee levels are sufficient to attract individuals with appropriate knowledge and experience.
NonExecutive Directors are paid a base fee and additional fees for chairmanship of Committees and the role of Senior Independent
In exceptional circumstances fees may also be paid for additional time spent on the Companys business outside of normal duties.
Fees are reviewed each year with any increases normally effective from 1 October.
Any increases in fees will be determined based on time commitment and will take into consideration the level of responsibility and fees paid in other companies of comparable size and complexity e. within the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts.
NonExecutive Directors do not receive any variable remuneration element or receive any other benefits other than being covered for disability benefits under the Companys insurance whilst travelling on Company business.
The Company will pay reasonable expenses incurred by the Chairman and NonExecutive Directors.
The Company may also provide limited hospitality and selected benefits and settle any tax thereon provided that this is in connection with the performance of their role.
Remuneration policy report continued Financial statements Countryside Properties PLC  Annual report 2017 Governance Strategic report Approach to recruitment remuneration The Committees approach to recruitment remuneration is to pay no more than is necessary to attract candidates of the appropriate calibre and experience needed for the role.
The remuneration package for any new recruit will be assessed following the same principles as for the Executive Directors as set out in the remuneration policy table.
Where an existing employee is promoted to the Board the Executive Director policy will apply.
Historical entitlements will continue to be honoured and allowed to pay out on their original terms and will be fully disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration at the relevant time.
The table below summarises our key policies with respect to recruitment remuneration Remuneration element Recruitment policy Base salary and benefits The salary level will be set taking into account a number of factors including market practice the individuals experience and responsibilities and other pay structures within Countryside and will be consistent with the salary policy for existing Executive Directors.
Starting salaries may therefore be set below the market level and subject to performance increased by more than inflation as the employee gains experience over time.
The Executive Director will be eligible to receive benefits in line with Countrysides benefits policy as set out in the remuneration policy table.
Pension An Executive Director will be able to participate in Countrysides defined contribution pension scheme or receive cash allowance in lieu of pension benefits in line with policy for existing Executive Directors.
Annual bonus An Executive Director will be eligible to participate in the annual bonus scheme as set out in the remuneration policy table.
The maximum opportunity will be no more than 150 per cent of salary of which up to onethird may be deferred in shares as per the policy for existing Executive Directors.
Depending on the timing of the appointment the Committee may deem it appropriate to set different annual bonus performance conditions for Executive Directors for the first year of appointment.
Longterm incentives An Executive Director will be eligible to participate in Countrysides Long Term Incentive Plan as set out in the remuneration policy table.
The maximum opportunity offered may be up to 200 per cent of salary as per the policy for existing Executive Directors.
An LTIP award can be made shortly following an appointment assuming the Company is not in a closed period.
Share buyoutsreplacement awards The Committees policy is to not provide buyouts as a matter of course.
However should the Committee believe it necessary to grant awards to replace awards from a previous employer the Committee will seek to structure any replacement awards such that overall they are no more favourable than the awards due to be forfeited.
In determining the quantum and structure of any buyout the Committee will take into account the fair value and as far as practicable the timing and performance requirements of remuneration foregone.
Where possible existing arrangements will be used although the Committee may also make use of the flexibility provided by the Listing Rules to make awards without prior shareholder approval in unusual circumstances.
Relocation policies Should relocation of a newly recruited Executive Director be required reasonable costs associated with this relocation will be met by the Company.
Such relocation support could include but not be limited to payment of legal fees removal costs temporary accommodationhotel costs a contribution to Stamp Duty replacement of nontransferable household items and related taxes incurred.
In addition and in appropriate circumstances the Committee may grant additional support in relation to the payment of school fees.
The Companys policy when setting fees for the appointment of new NonExecutive Directors is to apply the policy which applies to current NonExecutive Directors.
Countryside Properties PLC  Annual report 2017 Service agreements and compensation for loss of office When setting notice periods the Committee has regard to market practice and corporate governance best practice.
Our policy is that notice periods for Executive Directors should be no greater than 12 months.
Both the Group Chief Executive and the Group Chief Financial Officer have contracts with notice periods of 12 months from either side.
The notice period for NonExecutive Directors is three months save in the case of the Chairman whose notice period is six months.
The NonExecutive Directors do not have service contracts but are appointed under letters of appointment which provide for a review after an initial threeyear term with the possibility of annual renewal.
All service contracts and letters of appointment are available for viewing at the Companys registered office and at the AGM.
When approving any termination payments for a departing Director the Committee will always seek to minimise cost to the Company whilst complying with the contractual terms and seeking to reflect the circumstances in place at the time.
The Committee reserves the right to make additional payments where such payments are made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation or by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination of an Executive Directors office or employment and may provide assistance with outplacement costs.
The table below sets out for each element of total remuneration the Companys policy on payment for loss of office in respect of Executive Directors and any discretion available to the Committee.
Broadly treatment will depend on the circumstances of departure and in particular whether a leaver is a good leaver.
For a good leaver the following will normally apply Remuneration element Treatment on cessation Salary benefits and pension Received for the notice period or payment in lieu of notice.

This had the effect of deferring 5m of profit in relation to those sites from 2016 to 2017.
The Board believed that this change was in the best interests of shareholders.
However in order to ensure that the 2017 targets were appropriately stretching and management did not benefit as a result the Remuneration Committee set the targets for 2017 taking account of this profit deferral.

Materiality
Audit scope Key audit matters Countryside Properties PLC  Annual report 2017 Financial statements Strategic report Governance Report on the audit of the financial statements continued Our audit approach continued The scope of our audit As part of designing our audit we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements.
In particular we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgments for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.
As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the Directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that in the auditors professional judgment were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement whether or not due to fraud including those which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter Cost forecast and margin estimates Group Refer to Note 3 Accounting policies and Note 2 Critical accounting policies.
The Groups margin recognition framework is based on the margin forecast for each site.
These margins which drive the recognition of costs as each unit is sold reflect estimated selling prices and costs for each development.
This process is effectively a method of allocating the total forecast costs representing both land and build costs of a development over each individual unit.
There is a risk that the margin forecast for the site and the margin subsequently recognised on each unit sale is not appropriate and reflective of the actual final profit margin that will be recognised on a development.
We consider the appropriate margin recognition across the life of the site to be the most significant financial reporting risk for the Group principally due to the high level of management judgment involved in the accounting for the Groups developments given that sales prices and build costs are inherently uncertain and are influenced by changes in external market factors such as the availability of mortgages and build cost inflation.
We obtained an understanding of managements process for preparing a site forecast and evaluated managements controls over cost forecasting and changes to forecasts.
We tested managements controls over the approval of initial forecasts as well as the controls over the regular updating of forecasts.
We also attended a number of managements monthly divisional board meetings which gave us additional evidence over the robustness of the forecasting process.
We held discussions with management to understand the status and progress of a sample of sites and tested that the explanations received were consistent with the latest management forecast.
Our substantive procedures focused on sites that generated significant revenue in the year and we assessed the appropriateness of a sample of underlying assumptions within the forecasts including sales prices and costs which have a significant impact on the site forecasts assessed managements historic forecasting accuracy on completed sites in FY17 understanding the reasons and testing where appropriate differences to the FY16 forecast margin tested a sample of forecast sales prices to the actual sales price attained for similar properties to support the validity of the estimated sales price in the forecast and tested a sample of costs incurred to third party support.
Based on the procedures performed we did not identify any sites where we considered the forecast margin to be inappropriate.
Land and inventory valuation Group Refer to Note 3 Accounting policies and Note 2 Critical accounting policies.
Inventory is comprised of land held for development work in progress raw materials and completed unitspartexchanged properties.
Inventory is the most significant balance in the consolidated statement of financial position and is held at the lower of cost and net realisable value NRV being the margin the development is forecast to make over its lifecycle based upon forecast sales prices and build costs.
The NRV of each development is forecast and monitored as described in the key audit matter above and is therefore subject to the same key assumptions.
Due to the influence of the same external factors and the cyclical nature of the housing industry with periodic downturns in customer demand there is a risk that the calculation of a developments NRV may be subject to estimation error leading to inventory being held at an incorrect value and an unrecorded impairment charge.
We obtained an understanding of managements process for preparing a site forecast.
We understood and evaluated managements controls over the cost forecasting process and tested the key controls over the approval of the initial forecasts and the monitoring of updates required to the forecasts over the course of the sites life.
We considered margins for all material sites to identify those with low or eroding margins due to specific issues or underperformance.
We discussed the identified sites with management including considering the level of provisions if any held against these sites and corroborated the explanations with available external evidence in respect of the carrying value of inventory.
We obtained an analysis of the composition of the inventory balance specifically the level and ageing of completed but unreserved units to understand if completed stock is held at the appropriate carrying value.
We also assessed the historical accuracy of managements forecasting on completed sites in FY17 understanding the reasons and testing where appropriate differences to the FY16 forecast margin.
For sites with a provision we compared the inventory valuation with the forecast NRV.
Based on the procedures performed we did not identify any sites where we determined additional impairments were required above those already recorded by management.
Countryside Properties PLC  Annual report 2017 Report on the audit of the financial statements continued Our audit approach continued Key audit matters continued Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter Commercial land transactions Group Refer to Note 3 Accounting policies.
The Group has entered into a number of commercial land transactions during the year.
The nature of these transactions can be complex and bespoke.
The format of the agreements introduces potential accounting to reflect the terms of the agreements.
Due to their complex nature we focused on this area to ensure that the accounting reflected the underlying agreements.
We held discussions with management to understand the substance of material commercial land transactions.
Where applicable we read the relevant extracts from managements papers on the proposed accounting treatment of the transactions.
We substantively tested material or complex land acquisitions through examination of contracts and agreements to check that the acquisition and subsequent overage terms had been identified and accounted for appropriately and that all the related liabilities had been properly recorded in the financial statements.
We assessed the accounting treatment of the transactions against IAS 18IAS 11 as applicable.
We were satisfied that management had appropriately accounted for these transactions.
Shared equity valuation available for sale financial assets Group Refer to Note 3 Accounting policies and Note 2 Critical accounting policies.
The Group has advanced loans to homebuyers to assist them in the purchase of their property under shared equity schemes.
These loans are held as available for sale financial assets in the balance sheet and are held at fair value.
The valuation method for these assets is not capable of being based on observable market data and therefore the valuation model is subject to management judgment and estimates including expected house price movements credit risk of borrowers discount rates which incorporate purchaser default rates recoverability and expected timing of receipt.
Changes in the assumptions used can have a significant impact on the fair value of these assets.
We evaluated and tested the mechanics of the calculation to check the correct application of the underlying assumptions and accuracy of the calculation.
We obtained a sample of the original loan agreements to verify terms of the loans used within the calculation.
We tested a sample of cash receipts from redemptions in the year to bank statements.
Through discussion with management and review of the calculation we identified the key assumptions included within the calculation including expected house price inflation discount rates recoverability and expected timing of receipt.
We corroborated these assumptions by comparing those used by management with comparable discount rates used by similar companies and our own independent research on house prices and redemption rates.
In addition to reperforming managements sensitivities we performed our own sensitivities based upon our own independent research to ascertain the extent to which reasonable adverse changes would either individually or in aggregate materially change the valuation of the assets.
Based on the procedures we performed we identified no changes to key assumptions which would result in a material change to the valuation.
Recoverability of investments Parent Refer to Note 1 Accounting policies The parent company holds investments in its subsidiaries totalling over 700 million.
We focused on this area due to the size of the investment balance as there is a risk of material misstatement if the underlying investments are underperforming.
We obtained managements assessment of the carrying value of the investments.
We agreed the cash flow forecast used in the assessment to formally approved forecasts.
We assessed key assumptions within managements forecasts.
We performed a sensitivity analysis over key assumptions including the discount and growth rates.
We assessed for impairment indicators of which there were none.
We did not note any exceptions arising from our audit procedures.
Independent auditors report continued to the members of Countryside Properties PLC Countryside Properties PLC  Annual report 2017 Financial statements Strategic report Governance Report on the audit of the financial statements continued Our audit approach continued How we tailored the audit scope We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole taking into account the structure of the Group and the parent company the accounting processes and controls and the industry in which they operate.
The Group is comprised of two segments Housebuilding and Partnerships.
These are then further broken down into seven operating divisions five for Housebuilding and two for Partnerships.
Each of the divisions is broken down into a number of reporting units which also include joint ventures that are included in the Group financial statements along with the centralised functions.
The reporting units vary in size and we identified 17 reporting units including centralised functions and the parent company which required an audit of their complete financial information due to their individual size.
These 17 reporting units were all audited by the Group engagement team and where applicable included the audit of the joint ventures.
The reporting units where we performed an audit of the complete financial information accounted for 83 per cent of the Groups profit before tax adjusted for nonunderlying items and 85 per cent of the Groups revenue.
Our audit work at these reporting units together with the additional procedures performed at Group level on the consolidation goodwill joint venture adjustments tax share based payments and the available for sale financial assets gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the Group and parent company financial statements as a whole.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality.
We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality.
These together with qualitative considerations helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgment we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows Group financial statements Parent company financial statements Overall Group materiality 7.2 million 2016 4.6 million.
6.5 million 2016 4.1 million.
How we determined it 5% of profit before tax adjusted for nonunderlying items.
1% of total assets restricted to an amount below the Group overall materiality.
Rationale for benchmark applied Based on our professional judgment we determined materiality by applying a benchmark of 5% of profit before tax adjusted for nonunderlying items.
We believe that underlying profit before tax is the most appropriate measure as it eliminates any disproportionate effect of nonunderlying charges and credits and provides a consistent yearonyear basis for our work.
We believe that total assets is the primary measure used by the shareholders in assessing the position of the entity and is an accepted auditing benchmark.
For each component in the scope of our Group audit we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality.
The range of materiality allocated across components was between 0.2 million and 6.5 million.
Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was less than our overall Group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above 0.3 million Group audit 2016 0.2 million and 0.3 million parent company audit 2016 0.2 million as well as misstatements below those amounts that in our view warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern In accordance with ISAs UK we report as follows Reporting obligation Outcome We are required to report if we have anything material to add or draw attention to in respect of the Directors statement in the financial statements about whether the Directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements and the Directors identification of any material uncertainties to the Groups and the parent companys ability to continue as a going concern over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to.
However because not all future events or conditions can be predicted this statement is not a guarantee as to the Groups and parent companys ability to continue as a going concern.
We are required to report if the Directors statement relating to Going Concern in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R3 is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We have nothing to report.
Countryside Properties PLC  Annual report 2017 Report on the audit of the financial statements continued Reporting on other information The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors report thereon.
The
Directors are responsible for the other information.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and accordingly we do not express an audit opinion or except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report any form of assurance thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements our responsibility is to read the other information and in doing so consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information.
If based on the work we have performed we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors Report we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit the Companies Act 2006 CA06 ISAs UK and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority FCA require us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below required by ISAs UK unless otherwise stated.
Strategic Report and Directors Report In our opinion based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors Report for the year ended 30 September 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
CA06
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors Report.
CA06
The Directors assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the Group We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding The Directors confirmation on page 37 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group including those that would threaten its business model future performance solvency or liquidity.
The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
The Directors explanation on page 37 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review of the Directors statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group and statement in relation to the longerterm viability of the Group.
Our review was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the Directors process supporting their statements checking that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code the Code and considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding of the Group and parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit.
Listing Rules Other Code Provisions We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when The statement given by the Directors on page 53 that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the Groups and parent companys position and performance business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group and parent company obtained in the course of performing our audit.
The section of the Annual Report on page 52 describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
The Directors statement relating to the parent companys compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the Code specified under the Listing Rules for review by the auditors.
Directors Remuneration In our opinion the part of the Directors Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.

The Companys registered office is Countryside House The Drive Brentwood Essex CM13 3AT.
The Groups principal activities are building new homes and regeneration of public sector land.
The parent company financial statements are on pages 119 to 124.
Initial public offering IPO The Company listed its shares on the London Stock Exchange on 17 February 2016.
Prior to the IPO there was a reorganisation of the Group which is described in the 2016 financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the merger method of accounting because the transaction under which the Company became the holding company of OCM Luxembourg Coppice Midco S. r.
Midco was a Group reconstruction with no change in the ultimate ownership of the Group.
All the shareholdings in Midco were exchanged via a shareforshare transfer on 11 February 2016.
The Company did not actively trade at the time.
The result of the application of the capital reorganisation is to present the financial statements as if the Company had always owned the Group  the financial statements have been presented as a continuation of Midco.
Critical accounting judgements and estimates The preparation of the Groups financial statements under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS requires the Directors to make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets liabilities income expenses and related disclosures.
Critical accounting judgements In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies which are described in Note 3 the Directors have made no individual judgements that have a significant impact on the financial statements apart from those involving estimates which are described below.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty Estimates and underlying assumptions affecting the financial statements are based on historical experience and other relevant factors and are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
This approach forms the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Changes in accounting estimates may be necessary if there are changes in the circumstances on which the estimate was based or as a result of new information.
Such changes are recognised in the year in which the estimate is revised.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities are described below.
Estimation of site profitability In order to determine the profit or loss that the Group recognises on its developments and construction contracts in a specific period the Group allocates the total cost of each development or construction contract between the proportion completing in the period and the proportion to complete in a future period.
The assessment of the total costs to be incurred requires a degree of estimation due to the longterm nature of the Groups activities and because actual costs are subject to market fluctuations.
Group management has established internal controls to review and ensure the appropriateness of estimates made on an individual development or contract basis.
Carrying value of inventory Inventory generated through the normal course of business is recorded at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
A financial appraisal is prepared and updated monthly for each development which records an estimate of future revenues and expenditure.
As both future cost and sales prices fluctuate in line with local market conditions significant adverse variances in either costs or sales prices estimates could lead to an impairment of inventory.
In circumstances where forecast revenues are lower than anticipated expenditure an inventory provision is made.
This inventory provision may be reversed in future periods when there is evidence of improved selling prices or reduced expenditure forecast on a development.
Availableforsale financial assets Availableforsale financial assets comprise loans that have been advanced to homebuyers to assist in their purchase of property under historical shared equity schemes.
The loans are generally secured by a second charge over the property and are either interest free or have interest chargeable from the fifth year onwards.
The loans are held at fair value which is based on an estimate of the future cash flows from the loans.
The estimate considers the value of the property based upon market conditions including potential future house price increases and possible borrower default.
The loans are discounted at an interest rate equivalent to that which would be payable for equivalent loans made against property by a third party.
Accounting policies Basis of preparation These financial statements for the year to 30 September 2017 are those of the Company and all of its subsidiaries.
It has been prepared in accordance with the IFRS as endorsed by the European Union IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRS IC interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented unless otherwise stated.
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis in Sterling and rounded to the nearest 0.1m under the historical cost convention except for availableforsale financial assets and sharebased payments.
Going concern The Groups business activities together with the factors likely to affect its future development are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 39.
The financial position of the Group its cash flows liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described on pages 26 to 29 of the Strategic Report.
Further disclosures regarding borrowings are provided in Note 23.
Countryside Properties PLC  Annual report 2017 Financial statements Strategic report Governance Accounting policies continued Going concern continued As described in the Viability Statement the Directors have assessed the prospects and viability of the Company over a threeyear period to September 2020.
The Board has performed a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Company including those risks that would threaten Countrysides business model future performance solvency or liquidity.
Having considered the Groups cash flow forecasts the Directors are satisfied the Group has sufficient liquidity and covenant headroom to enable the Group to conduct its business and meet its liabilities as they fall due for at least the next 12 months.
Accordingly these financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis.
New standards amendments and interpretations No new standards amendments or interpretations effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on 1 October 2016 have had a material impact on the financial statements.
The following amendments to standards and interpretations which will be relevant to the preparation of the Groups financial statements have been issued but are not effective and have not been early adopted for the financial year beginning 1 October 2017 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments on Classification and Measurement effective 1 October 2018 addresses the classification measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities.
It replaces the guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification and measurement of financial instruments.
IFRS 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement categories for financial assets amortised cost fair value through Other Comprehensive Income and fair value through Profit and Loss PandL.
The impact of IFRS 9 is being assessed by management.
The principal change identified is that gains and losses on shared equity loans will no longer be recognised through the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income.
It is not expected that this change will have a material impact on the reported results of the Group but will introduce an element of volatility in the Groups reported profit as the valuation of the shared equity loan portfolio changes.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers effective 1 October 2018 deals with revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful information to users of financial statements about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entitys contracts with customers.
Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good or service.
The standard replaces IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 Construction Contracts and related interpretations.
During the second half the Group has undertaken a detailed exercise to determine whether IFRS 15 will have a material impact on the Groups results.
The new standard is effective for the Group for the 2019 financial year commencing on 1 October 2018.
This exercise is substantially complete and we have not yet identified any areas of our business where we will see material changes to the way in which we currently recognise revenue except as described below.
We are working with advisors and others in the industry to determine the appropriate treatment for the recognition of revenue on land sales to Registered Providers of social housing where separate construction activity is also performed for the Registered Provider.
We understand that this matter is due to be considered by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee at their meeting on 22 November 2017.
We expect to reach a conclusion on this in the first half of the 2018 financial year and will provide further narrative and quantative disclosure on the impact of the standard if any in our 2018 Annual Report.
IFRS 16 Leases effective 1 October 2019 addresses the definition of a lease recognition and measurement of leases and establishes principles for reporting useful information to users of financial statements about the leasing activities of both lessees and lessors.
A key change arising from IFRS 16 is that most operating leases will be accounted for on balance sheet for lessees.
The standard replaces IAS 17 Leases and related interpretations.
Whilst managements full impact assessment of the introduction of IFRS 16 is not complete the Group does not have a significant number of leases which relate principally to office buildings and leased company cars.
The principal impact is likely to be the recognition of additional leasing assets and liabilities and the income statement impact is not expected to be material.
Amendments to IAS 7 and IAS 12 effective 1 October 2018.
These amendments require additional disclosures in the statement of cash flows and recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses respectively.
Amendment to IFRS 2 effective 1 October 2018.
This amendment clarifies the measurement for cashsettled sharebased payments and the accounting for modifications that change an award from cash settled to equity settled.
It also introduces an exception to the principles in IFRS 2 that will require an award to be treated as if it was wholly equity settled where an employer is obliged to withhold an amount for the employees tax obligations associated with a sharebased payment and pay that amount to the tax authority.
Amendment to IFRS 15 effective 1 October 2018.
These amendments comprise clarifications of the guidance on identifying performance obligations accounting for licences of intellectual property and the principal versus agent assessment gross versus net revenue presentation.
There are no IFRSs or IFRS IC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group for the financial year beginning 1 October 2017.
The Group has not applied the following amendments to standards which are EU endorsed but not yet effective Amendments to IFRS 11 Accounting for Acquisitions of Interest in Joint Operations Amendments to IAS 1 Disclosure Initiative Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation Amendments to IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements on the Equity Method Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014 Cycle The Group is currently considering the impact of these amendments on the Group however it is anticipated they will be minimal and effects will principally relate to the amendment of current disclosures.
Countryside Properties PLC  Annual report 2017 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 30 September 2017 Accounting policies continued Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are entities which the Group has the power to control.
The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to govern the financial and operating policies so as to obtain economic benefits from its activities.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are consolidated in the financial statements using the acquisition method of accounting from the date on which control is obtained up until the date that control ceases.
Noncontrolling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the income statement the statement of changes in equity and the statement of financial position.
Where the accounting policies of a subsidiary or equityaccounted investee do not conform in all material respects to those of the Group adjustments are made on consolidation to reflect the accounting policies of the Group.
Intragroup transactions balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated in preparing the financial statements.
Gains arising from transactions with joint arrangements and associate are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the entity.
Associate and joint ventures An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence but does not exercise control or joint control.
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method.
The Group has applied IFRS 11 to all joint arrangements.
Under IFRS 11 investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor.
Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
Under the equity method of accounting interests in the associate and joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Groups share of the postacquisition profits or losses and movements in other comprehensive income.
When the Groups share of losses in an associate or joint venture equals or exceeds its interests in the associate or joint venture the Group does not recognise further losses unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.
Unrealised losses arising on transactions between the Group and its associate and joint ventures are eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
The Group funds its associate and joint ventures through a combination of equity investment and shareholder loans.
The Directors review the recoverability of investments and shareholder loans for impairment annually.
Where an investment is held in an associate or joint venture which has net liabilities the investment is held at Nil and other longterm interests such as shareholder loans are reduced by the value equal to the net liabilities unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of its associate or joint ventures.
Business combinations All acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.
The cost of an acquisition is the aggregate of the fair values of the assets transferred liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued at the date of acquisition.
The consideration transferred includes the fair value of the asset or liability resulting from a deferred and contingent consideration arrangement.
Costs directly relating to an acquisition are expensed to the income statement.
The identified assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at their fair value at the date of acquisition.
The excess of cost of acquisition over the aggregate fair value of the Groups share of the net identified assets plus identified intangible assets is recorded as goodwill.
Intangible assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration on acquisition of a subsidiary over the interest in net fair value of the identifiable net assets and contingent liabilities acquired.
If the total consideration transferred is less than the fair value of the net assets acquired the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
An impairment review is carried out annually or when circumstances arise that may indicate an impairment is likely.
The carrying value of goodwill is compared to its recoverable amount being the higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal.
Any impairment is charged immediately to the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the cash generating units CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
Brands
The Group carries assets on the balance sheet for brands that have been acquired.
Internally generated brands are not recognised.
Cost is determined at acquisition as being directly attributable cost or where relevant by using an appropriate valuation method.
Acquired brands are tested for impairment when a triggering event is identified.
Acquired brands are amortised over a period of 20 years.
Software
Computer software that generates an economic benefit of greater than one year is recognised as an intangible asset and carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Computer software costs that are recognised as assets are amortised on a straight line basis over their economic useful life of four years.
These are reviewed for impairment at such time as there is a change in circumstances by which the carrying value may no longer be recoverable.
Countryside Properties PLC  Annual report 2017 Financial statements Strategic report Governance Accounting policies continued Property plant and equipment Property plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any applicable impairment losses.
Depreciation is charged at rates to write off the cost of the asset on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.
The applicable annual rates are Plant and machinery 20 per cent to 25 per cent Fixtures and fittings 10 per cent The Group does not own any land or buildings considered to be nontrade related.
The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories loans and receivables and available for sale.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired.
Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
Financial assets are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or the Group transfers substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They are included in current assets except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period.
These are classified as noncurrent assets.
The Groups loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Availableforsale financial assets Availableforsale financial assets are nonderivative assets that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories.
They are included in noncurrent assets unless the investment matures or management intends to dispose of it within 12 months of the end of the reporting period.
Equity share scheme loans are classified as availableforsale financial assets and are initially recorded at fair value net of transaction costs.
Fair value is assessed annually with gains and losses being recognised directly in the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income until the loan is repaid.
The loans are discounted at an interest rate equivalent to market rate.
On repayment the accumulated fair value which had been recognised in the consolidated statement of changes in equity is recognised in the income statement.
If a loan is determined to be impaired any impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Increases in the fair value of availableforsale assets are initially deferred and recorded within reserves.
Reductions in the fair value of availableforsale assets are recorded as a reduction in reserves to the extent available with any additional reduction recorded in the income statement.
The net deferral of increases in fair value are disclosed in the availableforsale reserve.
Inventories
Inventories are normally stated at cost or fair value if acquired as part of a business combination and held at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Costs comprise direct materials applicable direct labour and those overheads incurred to bring the inventories to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value represents estimated selling price less all estimated costs to sell including sales and marketing costs.
Land options purchased are initially stated at cost.
Option costs are written off over the remaining life of the option and are also subject to impairment review.
Impairment reviews are performed when circumstances arise which indicate an impairment is likely such as a refusal of planning permission.
Any impairments are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Land inventory is recognised when the substantial risks and rewards of ownership transfer to the Group after unconditional exchange of contracts.
Where land is purchased with deferred payment terms a corresponding liability is recognised within trade and other payables.
Precontract expenditure is capitalised where it is probable that a contract will be signed or otherwise is recognised as an expense within costs of sales in the income statement.
Provisions for inventories are made where appropriate to reduce the value of inventories and work in progress to their net realisable value.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost less any provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment is established when the carrying value of the receivable exceeds the present value of the future cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate.
The carrying value of the receivable is reduced and any impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
If collection is expected in one year or less receivables are classified as current assets.
If not they are classified as noncurrent assets.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and other shortterm deposits held by the Group with maturities of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts are classified within current liabilities.
Countryside Properties PLC  Annual report 2017 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 30 September 2017 Accounting policies continued Trade payables Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated initially at their fair value and subsequently amortised cost.
Where land is purchased on deferred settlement terms the land and associated liability are discounted to their fair value.
The discount to fair value is amortised over the period of the credit term and charged to finance costs using the effective interest rate method.
Changes in estimates of the final payment due are capitalised into inventory and in due course to cost of sales in the income statement.
Trade payables also include liabilities in respect of land overage where the Group is committed to make contractual payments to land vendors related to the performance of the development in the future.
Land overage is estimated based on expected future cash flows in relation to relevant developments and where payment will take place in more than one year is discounted.
Deposits received from customers relating to sales of new properties are classified within current trade payables.
Trade payables are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less.
If not they are classified as noncurrent liabilities.
Borrowings
Interestbearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded initially at their fair value and bank loans are reported net of direct transaction costs to the extent that borrowings are available for offset.
Such instruments are subsequently carried at their amortised cost and finance charges including premiums payable on settlement or redemption are amortised over the term of the instrument using the effective interest rate method.
The excess of unamortised borrowing costs is disclosed within prepayments.
Bank loans are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the date of the statement of financial position.
Overdrafts are classified as current liabilities.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal obligation as a result of a past event which it is probable will result in an outflow of economic benefits that can be reliably estimated.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material the provision is discounted at the pretax discount rate that reflects the risks specific to the liability.
Provisions for onerous leases are recognised when the foreseeable net cash outflows on a lease exceed the benefits derived from the lease which has more than one year before expiring or option to exercise a break.
Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in share premium as a deduction from the proceeds.
Where any Group company holds shares in the Companys equity share capital the consideration paid including any directly attributable incremental costs is deducted from equity until the shares are cancelled or reissued.
Offsetting financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Revenue
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable net of applicable valueadded tax Stamp Duty Land Tax rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group.
Revenue and profit are recognised as set out below.
Private housing Revenue is recognised in the income statement on legal completion at the fair value of the consideration received.
Part exchange In certain instances property may be accepted in part consideration for a sale of a residential property.
The fair value is established by independent surveyors reduced for cost to sell.
Differences between net proceeds received and fair value are recorded as a reductionincrease in cost of sales.
The original sale is recorded in the normal way with the fair value of the exchanged property replacing cash receipts.
Cash incentives Cash incentives are considered to be a discount from the purchase price offered to the acquirer and are therefore accounted for as a reduction to revenue.
Land and commercial sales Revenue is recognised when substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the land or commercial property transfer to the buyer generally when there is an unconditional exchange of contracts.
Revenue is measured as the fair value of consideration received or receivable.
Affordable housing contracts and design and build contracting Contract revenue and costs are recognised in accordance with IAS 11 Construction Contracts.
Where the outcome of a longterm contract can be estimated reliably revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date.
This is normally measured by surveys of work performed to date.
Variations in contract work claims and incentive payments are included to the extent that it is probable that they will result in revenue and they are capable of being reliably measured.
Where the outcome of a longterm contract cannot be estimated reliably contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs incurred that it is probable will be recoverable.
Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue the expected loss is recognised immediately in the income statement within cost of sales.
Project management services Revenue earned for the provision of project management services typically to the Groups joint ventures and associate are recognised on an accruals basis in line with the underlying contract.
Countryside Properties PLC  Annual report 2017 Financial statements Strategic report Governance Accounting policies continued Cost of sales For sales of private housing the Group determines the value of inventory charged to cost of sales based on the total forecast cost of developing a site.
Once the total expected costs of development are established they are allocated to individual plots to achieve a build cost per plot.
These costs are recognised within cost of sales when the related revenue is recognised in accordance with the Groups revenue recognition policy.
T o the extent that additional costs or savings are identified as the site progresses these are recognised over the remaining plots unless they are specific to a particular plot in which case they are recognised in the income statement at the point of sale.
For land and commercial property sales cost of sales represents the carrying value of the related inventory on the Groups statement of financial position and this is recognised within cost of sales when revenue is recognised in accordance with the Groups revenue recognition policy.
As outlined above costs in relation to the sale of affordable housing and design and build contracts are recognised in accordance with IAS 11.
Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable and incentives receivable under operating leases are recognised on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Finance costs and finance income Borrowing costs Borrowing costs in relation to the Groups debt facility are recognised on an accruals basis.
Also included in borrowing costs is the amortisation of fees associated with the arrangement of the financing.
Finance charges including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
The Group does not capitalise borrowing costs into developments.
Unwind of discounting The finance cost associated with the time value of money on discounted receivables and payables is recognised within finance costs as the discount unwinds over the life of the relevant item.
Current and deferred income taxation Income tax comprises current and deferred tax.
Current taxation The current taxation payable is based on taxable profit for the period which differs from accounting profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and those items never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is measured using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax rates used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction which affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated at the substantively enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled based upon tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in comprehensive income except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity or items charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income in which case the deferred tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the Group intends to settle the balances on a net basis.
Segment reporting Segment reporting is presented in the consolidated financial statements in respect of the Groups business segments.
Segmental reporting reflects the Groups management structure and primary basis of internal reporting.
Segmental results include items directly attributable to the segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
The chief operating decisionmaker CODM has been identified as the Groups Executive Committee.
The CODM reviews the Groups internal reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources.
The CODM assesses the performance of the operating segments based on underlying operating profit and tangible net operating asset values TNOAV.
Pension obligations The Group operates a defined contribution pension plan.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions to a separate entity.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they fall due.
Sharebased payments The Group provides benefits to employees including Directors of the Group in the form of equitysettled sharebased payment transactions whereby employees render services in exchange for rights over shares.
For equitysettled sharebased payments the fair value of the employee services rendered is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares awarded or options granted excluding the impact of any nonmarket vesting conditions.
All share options are valued using an optionpricing model Black Scholes or Monte Carlo.
This fair value is charged to the income statement over the vesting period of the sharebased payment scheme.
Countryside Properties PLC  Annual report 2017 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 30 September 2017 Accounting policies continued Sharebased payments continued Countryside Properties PLC invoices its subsidiary undertakings an amount equivalent to the fair value of the grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiaries.
The fair value of employee services received measured by reference to the grant date fair value is recognised over the vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings with a corresponding credit to equity.
The Group does not operate any cashsettled sharebased payment plans.
Adjusted measures Certain items which do not relate to the Groups underlying performance are presented separately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as nonunderlying items where in the judgement of the Directors they need to be disclosed separately by virtue of their nature size or incidence in order to obtain a clear and consistent presentation of the Groups underlying business performance.
As these nonunderlying items can vary significantly from year to year they create volatility in reported earnings.
In addition the Directors believe that in discussing the performance of the Group the results of joint ventures and associate should be proportionally consolidated including the Groups share of revenue operating profit and TNOAV given their importance to the Groups operations.
As such the Directors believe that the adjusted revenue adjusted Group operating profit and adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share measures presented provide a clear and consistent presentation of the underlying performance of the Groups ongoing business for shareholders.
Adjusted Group operating profit is not defined by IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable with the adjusted or underlying profit measures of other companies.
Examples of material and nonrecurring items which may give rise to disclosure as nonunderlying items are fees incurred in relation to business combinations or capital market transactions adjustments to the statement of financial position that do not relate to trading activity such as the recognition and reversal of nontrade impairments the impact of material and nonrecurring changes to discount rates accelerated write off of unamortised issue costs on the refinancing of borrowings and the costs of Group restructuring exercises.
Sharebased payment charges in respect of the preIPO Management Incentive Plan established during the year ended 30 September 2013 in connection with the acquisition of Copthorn Holdings Limited and its subsidiary companies by Oaktree Capital Management LLC were also treated as a nonunderlying item in the prior year.
This allows the underlying performance of the Group to be measured from period to period due to the fact that full benefits of owning these shares are crystallised only following an exit event such as the IPO.
Adjusted Group operating profit is one of the key measures used by the Board to monitor Groups performance.
Dividends
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Dividends payable are recorded in the period in which they are approved or paid whichever is earliest.
Segmental reporting Segmental reporting is presented in respect of the Groups business segments reflecting the Groups management and internal reporting structure and is the basis on which strategic operating decisions are made by the Groups Chief Operating DecisionMaker CODM.
The Groups two business segments are Partnerships and Housebuilding.
The Partnerships division specialises in medium to largescale housing regeneration schemes delivering private and affordable homes in partnership with public sector land owners and operates primarily in and around London the West Midlands and the North West of England.
The Housebuilding division develops largescale sites providing private and affordable housing on land owned or controlled by the Group primarily around London and in the SouthEast of England operating under both the Countryside and Millgate brands.
Segmental adjusted operating profit and segmental operating profit includes items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Central head office costs have been allocated between the segments using a percentage of revenue basis.
Items below Group operating profit have not been allocated.
Segmental net assets and tangible net operating asset value includes items directly attributable to the segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis with the exception of intangibles and net cash or bank debt excluding unamortised bank loan and arrangement fees.
Countryside operates entirely within the United Kingdom.

This resulted in a material nonrecurring finance cost of 7.6m 2016 Nil being recognised as an expense within nonunderlying finance costs.
Impairment of unamortised loan arrangement fees As described in Note 23 the Group refinanced in May 2016.
As a result unamortised debt finance costs in relation to the previous facility as at the refinancing date of Nil 2016 3.2m were expensed as a nonunderlying finance cost.
Taxation
A total tax credit of 1.8m 2016 1.0m in relation to all of the above nonrecurring items was included within taxation in the income statement.
The Directors believe that adjusted revenue including share of revenue from associate and joint ventures adjusted operating profit including share of operating profit from associates and joint ventures and underlying diluted and basic earnings per share measures presented provide a clear and consistent presentation of the underlying performance of the Groups ongoing business for shareholders.
These are not measures that are defined by IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable with the adjusted or underlying profit measures of other companies.

This will reduce the Groups future tax charge accordingly.
Deferred taxes at the balance sheet date have been measured using the enacted rates that are expected to apply to the unwind of each asset or liability.
The tax assessed for the year is lower 2016 higher than the standard rate of corporation tax in the United Kingdom which is 19.5 per cent 2016 20.0 per cent.

Deferred tax recorded directly to equity Tax of 0.7m 2016 0.2m was credited directly to equity in relation to sharebased payments.
Legislative changes In the March 2016 Budget the Government announced that it will introduce new rules to restrict the deductibility of net interest costs from 1 April 2017 and that from the same date the amount of taxable profits that can be offset by brought forward tax losses will be restricted to 50 per cent of those profits.
As the proposed changes had not been substantively enacted by the end of the financial period to which these financial statements relate their effects are not included in the tax notes.
The overall effect of these changes would not have had a material impact on the financial statements if they had been substantively enacted in the period.
Earnings per share Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue.
In the prior year the weighted average number of shares in issue was calculated from the date of the IPO to 30 September 2016.

Goodwill relates to the acquisition of the Copthorn Holdings Group in April 2013 19.3m and Millgate Developments in February 2014 18.5m.
Both entities are considered to be cash generating units CGUs.
The goodwill balance is tested annually for impairment.
The recoverable amount has been determined as the value in use of the business assessed on the current fiveyear cash flow forecasts.
These forecasts are based on achieving the Groups mediumterm targets of 17 per cent operating margin and 28 per cent ROCE with appropriate growth rates applied in following years.
Forecast revenue is based on a Boardapproved fiveyear plan which takes into account current market trends and the Groups growth plans.
Cash flow beyond the fiveyear period is extrapolated using a growth rate of 2 per cent per annum.
Cash flows generated by both CGUs are discounted using a pretax discount rate of 12.5 per cent approved by the Board of Directors.
Sensitivities
The recoverable value of both CGUs is substantially in excess of the carrying value of goodwill.
Sensitivity analysis has been undertaken on each goodwill impairment review by changing the discount rates profit margins growth rates and other variables applicable to each CGU.
None of these sensitivities either individually or combined resulted in the recoverable amount of the goodwill being reduced to below its current carrying value.
Brand
Brand relates to both the Countryside brand 13.5m acquired as part of the Copthorn Holdings Group in 2013 and the Millgate brand 10.7m acquired as part of Millgate Developments Limited in 2014.

The loans are secured by either a first or second legal charge over the property and are either interest free or have interest chargeable from the fifth year onwards or tenth year onwards dependent upon the scheme under which the loans were issued.
The assets are held at fair value which represents the current market value of the properties held discounted to fair value based on the redemption date of the loan.
These loans are subject to credit risk where loans may potentially not be repaid if the borrower defaults on repayment.
An adjustment for credit risk is built into the calculation by using a discount rate equivalent for home loans which rank behind mortgages.
None of these financial assets are either past due or impaired.
The estimated value takes into consideration movements in house prices the anticipated timing of the repayment of the asset and associated credit risk.
As the precise valuation and timing of the redemption of these assets remains uncertain the Group applies assumptions based upon current market conditions and the Groups experience of actual cash flows resulting from these transactions.
These assumptions are reviewed at the end of each financial year as part of the impairment review conducted by the Directors.
The difference between the estimated future value and the initial fair value is credited to finance income over the term of the loan.
Future house price inflation is assumed to be zero 2016 zero.
The discount rate applied is 8.5 per cent 2016 8.5 per cent which the Directors believe approximates the cost of a second charge mortgage on similar properties.
If UK house price inflation had been one per cent higher or lower with all other variables held constant and excluding any effect of current or deferred tax the value of shared equity would increase or decrease by 0.1m 2016 0.1m respectively whilst if the discount rate used had been one per cent higher or lower the value of these financial instruments would decrease or increase by 0.4m 2016 0.5m and 0.4m 2016 0.5m respectively.
Changes in economic conditions will change the estimates made therefore impacting the fair value of these loans.
The inputs used are by nature estimated and the resultant fair value has been classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy.

Bank loans Bank loan and arrangement fees Bank loans In May 2016 the Group signed a new 300m revolving credit facility with Lloyds Bank plc Barclays Bank PLC HSBC Bank plc and Santander UK plc.
The agreement has a variable interest rate based on LIBOR and expires in May 2021 although the Group has the opportunity to extend the term of the facility by a further two years.
Subject to obtaining credit approval from the syndicate banks the Group also has the option to extend the facility by a further 100m.
This facility is subject to both financial and nonfinancial covenants and is secured by floating charges over all the Groups assets.
In May 2017 the Group exercised the first option to extend the facility by a further year to May 2022.
The carrying value of the loans drawn under both the old and new facilities is equal to their fair value.
As the impact of discounting is not significant the fair values are based on discounted cash flows and are within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Bank loan arrangement fees are amortised over the term of the facility.
As a result of the signing of the new facility agreement in the prior year the unamortised loan arrangement fee for the previous facility of 3.2m was expensed to the income statement as a nonunderlying finance cost in 2016 Note 6b.
2.8m of debt finance costs in 2016 were capitalised in relation to the new facility and a further 0.6m of debt finance costs were capitalised in relation to the May 2017 extension.

The different levels have been defined as follows Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly that is as prices or indirectly that is derived from prices.
Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is unobservable inputs.
The key assumptions used in Level 3 valuations include house price movements the expected timing of receipts credit risk and discount rates.
Future house price inflation is assumed to be zero 2016 zero.
The discount rate applied was 8.5 per cent 2016 8.5 per cent which Directors believe approximates the cost of a second charge mortgage on similar properties.
T echniques such as discounted cash flow analysis have been used to determine fair value for the Level 3 financial instruments.
The following table presents the Groups assets that are measured at fair value at 30 September Level 1 Level 2 Level 3
Assets
Availableforsale financial assets   7.4 7.4
Availableforsale financial assets   8.7 8.7 There were no transfers between levels during the year.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market for example overthecounter derivatives is determined by using valuation techniques.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entityspecific estimates.
If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable the instrument is included in Level 2.
If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data the instrument is included in Level 3.
The fair values of the financial instruments that are measured at amortised cost is not shown because the difference is not material.
Financial risk management The main financial risks associated with the Group have been identified as liquidity risk interest rate risk housing market risk and credit risk.
The Directors are responsible for managing these risks and the policies adopted are set out below.
Liquidity risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of equity Company share capital reserves and retained earnings and debt bank loan facilities.
The Group manages its liquidity risk by monitoring its existing facilities for both financial covenant and funding headroom against forecast requirements based on shortterm and longterm cash flow forecasts.

Interest rate risk Interest rate risk reflects the Groups exposure to fluctuations in interest rates in the market.
This risk arises from bank loans that are drawn under the Groups loan facilities with variable interest rates based upon UK LIBOR.
For the year ended 30 September 2017 it is estimated that an increase by 0.5 per cent in interest rates would have decreased the Groups profit before tax by 0.4m 2016 0.7m.

The Group has no exposure to foreign currency risk.
Housing market risk The Group is affected by price fluctuations in the UK housing market.
These are in turn affected by the wider economic conditions such as mortgage availability and associated interest rates employment and consumer confidence.
Whilst these risks are beyond the Groups ultimate control risk is spread across business activities undertaken by the Group and the geographic regions in which it operates.
We have considered the sensitivity in relation to availableforsale financial assets which is detailed in Note 15.
Credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk is limited solely to the United Kingdom for housebuilding activities and by the fact that the Group receives cash at the point of legal completion of its sales.
The Groups remaining credit risk predominantly arises from trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
Loans receivable from financial assets held for sale are those advanced to homebuyers to assist in their purchase of property under the shared equity schemes.
The loans are secured by either a first or second charge over the property and are held at fair value.
Trade receivables on deferred terms arise from land sales.
The amount deferred is secured by a charge over the land until such time payment is received.
Trade and other receivables comprise mainly the amounts receivable from the Homes and Communities Agency in relation to the Help to Buy scheme housing associations joint ventures and the associate.
The Directors consider the credit rating of the various debtors is good in respect of the amounts outstanding and therefore credit risk is considered to be low.
Cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments are held with UK clearing banks which are either A or A rated.
Capital management The Groups policies seek to protect returns to shareholders by ensuring the Group will continue to trade profitably in the foreseeable future.
The Group also aims to optimise its capital structure of debt and equity so as to minimise its cost of capital.
The Group manages its capital with regard to the risks inherent in the business and the sector within which it operates by monitoring its actual cash flows against bank loan facilities financial covenants and the cash flow forecasts approved by the Directors.

The loss for the year was 2.6m 2016 11.2m from the period from incorporation to 30 September 2016.
The financial statements are prepared in Sterling which is the functional currency of the Company and are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds.
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
The Company has not disclosed the information required by regulation 51b of the Companies Disclosure of Auditor Remuneration and Liability Limitation Agreements Regulations 2008 as the Group accounts of the Company are required to comply with regulation 51b as if the undertakings included in the consolidation were a single group.
1.2 Going concern The Groups business activities together with the factors likely to affect its future development are set out in the strategic report on pages 2 to 39.
The financial position of the Group its cash flows liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Chief Financial Officers Review on pages 26 to 29 of the Strategic Report.
Further disclosures regarding borrowings are provided in Note 24 of the Group financial statements including the impact of certain sensitivities.
The Directors are satisfied the Group has sufficient liquidity and covenant headroom to enable the Group to conduct its business and meet its liabilities as they fall due for at least the next 12 months.
The Companys ability to continue as a going concern is inextricably linked to the results of the Group as a whole.
As such the Directors consider the Company to be a going concern and these financial statements are prepared on this basis.
1.3 Fixed asset investments The value of the investment in each subsidiary held by the Company is recorded at cost less any impairment in the Companys statement of financial position.
A subsidiary is an entity that the Company has the power to control.
1.4 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and other shortterm deposits held by the Company with maturities of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts are classified within current liabilities.
1.5 Financial instruments Fair value measurement of financial instruments The Company has adopted IAS 39 Recognition and Measurement of Financial Instruments.
Financial assets Financial assets which primarily represent loans to subsidiary companies and cash are initially recognised at fair value.
Borrowings
Interestbearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded initially at their fair value net of direct transaction costs.
Borrowings are subsequently carried at their amortised cost and loan arrangement fees are amortised over the term of the instrument.
Finance costs associated with each individual drawdown are expensed over the period of that drawdown.
Borrowings are classified as noncurrent liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability until the end of the term of the agreement.
Further details of the Companys bank loans can be found in Note 24 of the Group financial statements.
Countryside Properties PLC  Annual report 2017 Countryside Properties PLC  Annual report 2017 Accounting policies continued 1.6 Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Dividends payable on equity instruments are recognised as liabilities once they are no longer at the discretion of the Company.
1.7 Taxation Current taxation Income tax for the years presented comprises current and deferred tax.
The current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the period which differs from accounting profit as reported in the statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and those items never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is measured using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
1.8 Dividend Dividend distributions to Countryside Properties PLC shareholders are recognised in the Companys financial statements in the periods in which the final dividends are approved in the Annual General Meeting or when paid in the case of an interim dividend.

Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds.
1.10 Related parties The Group discloses transactions with related parties which are not wholly owned within the same Group.
Where appropriate transactions of a similar nature are aggregated unless in the opinion of the Directors separate disclosure is necessary to understand the effect of the transactions on the Group financial statements.
Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty The preparation of the financial statements requires the Directors to make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets liabilities income expenses and related disclosures.
Critical accounting judgements In the process of applying the Companys accounting policies which are described above the Directors have made no individual judgements that have had significant impact upon the financial information apart from those involving estimations which are dealt with below.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty The estimates and underlying assumptions are based on historical experience and other relevant factors and are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
This approach forms the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Changes in accounting estimates may be necessary if there are changes in the circumstances on which the estimate was based or as a result of new information.
Such changes are recognised in the year in which the estimate is revised.
The key assumptions about the future and key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities are described below.
Impairment of fixed asset investments Determining whether fixed asset investments are impaired requires judgement and estimation.
The Directors periodically review fixed asset investments for possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate in managements judgement that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Such indicating events would include a significant planned restructuring a major change in market conditions or technology and expectations of future operating losses or negative cash flows.
