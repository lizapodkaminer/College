STATEMENT
2017 was a transformational year for Animalcare Group plc.
Whilst characterised by continued organic growth the most dominant factor during the year was the reverse acquisition of Ecuphar NV Ecuphar.
The transaction completed on 13 th July 2017 and our statutory results for the year ended December 2017 reflect a full 12 months contribution from Ecuphar and five and a half months of Animalcare Group plc Animalcare as previously constituted. comparatives are only for the Ecuphar business.
Financial Trading Group revenue increased by 22.4% to 83.7m 2016 68.4m with 11.3% organic growth within the Ecuphar business which contributed 76.1m to overall Group revenues and 7.6m from the original Animalcare business.
Underlying EBITDA which excludes fair value adjustments on acquired inventory amortisation of acquired intangibles and acquisition and integration costs increased by 11.9% to 10.0m 2016 8.9m with 1.6m contributed by the Animalcare business.
This performance primarily reflects the impact of lower gross margins investments to support future growth and the disposal of Nutriscience which Ecuphar sold in October 2016.
Including nonunderlying items the Groups profit before tax decreased to 0.5m 2016 5.1m.
The Group generated 2.6m 2016 9.3m net cash from operations which included a cash outflow from nonunderlying items totalling 3.8m.
Further details on business performance can be found in the CEO Review and CFO Review respectively.
Board
Following the acquisition the executive Directors comprised Chris Cardon who took on the role of Chief Executive Officer for the enlarged group supported by Iain Menneer as Chief Operating Officer and Walter Beyers as Chief Financial
In September 2017 Chris Brewster who at the time of the acquisition stood down as a Board Director but remained within the business was reappointed to the Board as Chief Financial Officer replacing Walter Beyers who resigned to pursue other interests.
More recently Iain Menneer stood down as Chief Operating Officer.
I would like to take the opportunity to recognise both Iains and Walters contributions and we wish them well for the future.
Dividend
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 2.0 pence per share which when added to the second interim dividend of 4.7 pence per shares gives a total dividend of 6.7 pence per share since the reverse acquisition.
This final dividend is subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting on 27th June 2018 and will be paid on 6th July 2018 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 8th June 2018.
Product Development A key strategy for growth remains the continued cultivation of a strong new product development pipeline.
In 2017 we launched Acecare a sedative from Animalcares original UK pipeline and sales have performed in line with internal forecasts.
We have deliberately focused the development team on 17 active projects and we have a steady flow of products that are going through registration and are expected to launch in 2018 and 2019.
Summary and Outlook Having brought together two highly complementary businesses in particular with regard to our respective geographic markets product portfolios and product development pipelines we are growing a successful pan European animal health business.
We have the opportunity to continue this growth through further strategic acquisitions but also through organic growth focused on existing products and our product development pipeline as well as the synergies and benefits of crossselling which we expect to see impacting our Q4 2018 performance and more meaningfully in 2019.
We believe we have created a platform for strong future growth and I look forward to updating on our progress.

Overview
Products are supplied to animal health professionals both directly or through national distribution networks and fall into two categories regulated pharmaceuticals and over the counter products.
Products are either owned by the Group or on distribution from third parties.
The Group invests significantly in its inhouse development pipeline.
The portfolio is very broad with over 300 products including pharmaceuticals vaccines biocides and nutraceuticals.
The Group focuses on certain niche therapy areas including odontology dermatology otology and surgeryanaesthesia.
Overview
Medini is the wholesaling division based close to Bruges supplying medical veterinary and paramedical products to veterinary professionals throughout Belgium.
The business has been trading for 25 years and is well established in this stable market.
The extensive range of over 5000 products includes own label and branded items ranging from small disposable items to larger capital equipment and diagnostic instruments.
The company is a specialist in the supply of surgical instruments.

Animalcare Group plc Annual Report 2017 site Stock Code ANCR STRATEGIC REPORT OUR BUSINESS 05 26011 Proof 4 OUR MARKETPLACE One in three homes in Europe is estimated to keep a pet prompting total care spending of 38bn.
Pet numbers increased by 10% between 2012 and 2015 to 623 million in contrast to a decline in farm animal numbers by 9% to 296 million.
Of the European medicines sector valued at approximately 6bn in 2017 sales of vaccines and parasiticides represent 30% each 1.8bn with antimicrobials falling to 13% market share.
The market as a whole grew by 9% in that period.
Animal health markets in both Europe and the US are now dominated by their respective companion animal sectors.
The latter valued at approximately 5.9bn www. hi. rg.
Our Primary Market The enlarged Group now generates 57% of its revenues from its sales in the Companion Animal and Equine sector and is therefore well placed to benefit from the rise in European pet ownership and spend.
The Group still generates strong sales from the Production Animal sector in niche profitable product areas.
The Group comprises direct sales and marketing operations in 7 European territories see graphic on page 4.
Distribution to European and Rest of World geographic territories is managed by our export team.
The pharmaceutical licensing is managed through our inhouse regulatory team or local consultants where necessary.
Our revenue from export sales has increased steadily in recent years and offers great potential for future growth.
The Group will continue to serve the Small and Large Animal markets and bring new products to each segment where there is a commercial and strategic fit.
Over the last five years sales of medicines for companion animals have overtaken sales of farm animal products rising from 47% to 53% of the European market with sales in 2017 of approximately 3.17bn www. nimalhealtheurope. u.
OUR MARKETS BY GEOGRAPHY The export business continued its strong growth in 2017 with sales improving 24% versus prior year.
Animalcare Group now exports to 38 countries in Europe Asia Australasia Africa and South America through 86 different distribution partners.
The addition of the Animalcare Ltd small animal products has created a wellbalanced export portfolio of Farm Animal Equine Small Animal and OTC brands.
To facilitate the increased complexity of the export business and to help drive further growth a dedicated export division has been formed with Martin Gore Group Head of
The export division has associates from all three exporting centres in the business Animalcare Ltd UK Ecuphar Veterinaria ES and Ecuphar NV BE with over 40 years combined experience in the Animal Health market between them.
We believe with the formation of this team and the increased focus and resources on exports the export business will continue to contribute strongly to the Groups sales and profits.
During the year there was significant growth in the key core export markets of the UK France the Nordics and Ireland supported by growth in newer markets including New Zealand and Taiwan.
The growth of recently launched products Aqupharm and Isocare were ahead of management expectations while sales of core established brands Danilon Otoclean and Caniquantel all showed double digit growth.
Dinalgen sales were behind prior year but this was largely down to phasing of purchasing patterns in major markets.
Looking forward there will be some natural slippage in the short term for the export business as sales through distribution partners in countries where we have a direct sales force are moved inhouse.
While this decreases export sales it will be profit enhancing for the Group.
This has not affected the export division in 2017 and will have minimal effect in 2018 but notice has now been served on distribution partners in Germany Spain Portugal Italy and Belgium with the full benefits being gained from 2019 onwards.
The focus for 2018 is on quick wins especially expanding the OTC business and rationalising distributors.
Contracts have been signed for OTC products in new markets in the Middle East and China with sales expected to come on line mid 2018 assuming no regulatory issues.
Longer term we see good opportunities for growth in our pharmaceutical exports especially in the fast growing Asian market.
There are continued concerns surrounding the use of antibiotics in Western and Northern Europe countries that may affect future sales of our antibiotics range.
In summary the export business is now a significant contributor to the Group and by creating a dedicated export division we see potential for longterm growth.

83.7 2017 68.4 2016 The Group delivered total revenue growth of 22.4% of which 11.3% was from the continuing Ecuphar business.
Through maximising existing portfolio revenues delivering new products from our pipeline and via our network of partnerships we aim to achieve organic growth in excess of our blended market growth rate broadly matching revenue and profit growth in the medium term.
Acquired businesses have to be a good fit with our operating culture and strategy in addition to being valueenhancing financially.
Basic Underlying Earnings per share EPS The measure of how successful we are in growing our business organically and by acquisition coupled with strong financial disciplines including those related to tax and capital allocation is captured in the Groups underlying earnings per share.
12.6 2017 16.7 2016 The decrease reflects the significant increase in the adjusted weighted average number of shares following the reverse acquisition.
Underlying EPS is a key measure of our overall performance and the return we generate for shareholders before exceptional items.
We aim to grow the business from 2018 to deliver yearonyear earnings enhancement.

READ ABOUT OUR STRATEGY ON PAGES 10 AND 11 READ ABOUT OUR PERFORMANCE ON PAGES 13 TO 25 12 26011 Proof 4 Introduction and Summary of the Group The key aim for our business is to create a cashgenerative growing panEuropean animal health company and in July 2017 Animalcare Group plc completed the acquisition of Ecuphar NV Ecuphar an acquisition that constituted a reverse takeover.
This brought together two businesses to create an enlarged group focused on the development and marketing of innovative products providing significant benefits to animal health.
The business now has a considerably enlarged footprint and sales network with direct sales teams in 7 European countries and an export network that covers over 38 countries across Europe Asia Australasia Africa and South America through 86 different distribution partners.
Within our product portfolio we have 50 licensed drugs eight vaccines and over 100 care and nutraceutical products employing around 100 sales representatives and 28 agents marketing these products to our global customer base.
Shareholders in Animalcare are now invested in a substantially increased panEuropean animal health platform with the following characteristics and strategic objectives Delivering double digit profit growth We expect to deliver further incremental organic growth across revenues EBITDA and underlying net earnings with the potential to achieve doubledigit profit growth.
Cash generative Continuing focus on cash generation allows us to maintain dividend payments as well as invest in our business to drive future growth.
Strong organic growth potential We now have an increased geographic footprint for crossselling we expect to extract further synergies taking effect in 2018 but with a more meaningful impact in 2019 and we expect to deliver further growth through our new product development pipeline.
Acquisitive growth potential Our strong balance sheet and scale also opens opportunities for valueaccretive acquisitions which would allow us to target direct sales in other geographical territories.
Business Review
The Group is focused on the development and sale of veterinary products in the companion animal production animal and equine markets and is divided into two segments Pharmaceuticals and Wholesale.
Pharmaceuticals
The Pharmaceuticals segment develops and markets veterinary pharmaceutical products which are supplied to animal health professionals both directly and through our international distribution network.
Our products fall into two categories regulated pharmaceuticals and over the counter products.
Products are either owned by the Group or licensed on longterm distribution agreements with third parties.
We have a very broad portfolio of over 300 products including pharmaceuticals vaccines biocides and nutraceuticals and the Group focuses on certain niche therapy areas including odontology dermatology otology and surgeryanaesthesia.
As a Group we invest significantly in our inhouse development pipeline which I discuss later on in my report.
T h e key aim for our business is to create a cash generative growing pan

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS REVIEW
Following the acquisition this segment now includes the products that were previously categorised as Licensed Veterinary Medicines Animal Welfare and Companion Animal Identification.
Based on the statutory results for the year ended 31 st
2017 sales in this division net of intercompany sales increased by 28.4% to 59.7m 2016 46.5m which now accounts for 71.4% of total revenues.
The 13.2m yearonyear increase is attributable to an additional 7.6m of sales derived from acquisition growth with the balance generated through organic growth within the Ecuphar business.
Organic growth was driven by a number of factors including a very strong performance from sales into the Production Animals market as well as strong growth from Companion Animals.
In the division our top 20 pharmaceutical products which account for 51% of this divisions total sales grew by 15.1% in 2017.
Looking at our direct sales markets Orozyme the first product of the Company that was developed continues to hold a strong position in the Orodental area.
Direct sales for this product grew by 11% and we expect to see further growth in this area through the launch of new innovative products in 2018.
Leisguard our treatment against leishmaniosis in dogs showed strong sales across our Mediterranean footprint and we expect to see future growth for this product in 2018 in Scandinavia.
Prazitel and Caniquantel which both play an important role in the area of antiparasitic treatment also grew well in 2017.
We were pleased with the performance across our export network.
Our key core export markets of France the Nordics and UK and Ireland showed significant growth and we expect to benefit from ongoing direct sales in the UK now following the acquisition.
During the period we signed new distribution agreements to cover New Zealand and Taiwan and both regions granted regulatory approval to sell Aqupharm intravenous fluid range and Isocare anaesthesia our recently launched products for use in surgery.
This contributed to the growth of Aqupharm and Isocare sales which were ahead of management expectations and sales of core established brands such as Danilon antiinflammatory Otoclean dermatology and Caniquantel antiparasitics all showed double digit growth.
Dinalgen antiinflammatory sales were behind prior year but this was largely down to phasing of purchasing patterns in major markets.
The positive impact of the crossselling opportunity was minimal during the year.
We expect to see this contribute to our organic growth during Q4 2018 later than originally anticipated with a more meaningful contribution in 2019.
The underlying EBITDA performance of our Pharmaceuticals division increased by 15.1% to 9.7m 97.1% of the Groups underlying EBITDA with reported EBITDA reducing to 7.5m 2016 10.2m.
Whilst this underlying growth was driven by the contribution of the acquisition the organic performance in this division was impacted by lower gross margins mainly due to a changing sales mix following higher growth from lower margin Production Animal products and export sales as well as pricing pressures in a competitive market and the disposal of Nutriscience in 2016 which generated 1.3m of sales at margins in excess of 50%.
Whilst the impact of a changing sales mix and competitive pricing pressures are likely to persist over the rest of 2018 we expect to deliver at least double digit growth in underlying EBITDA in this division and to see further strong sales growth driven by a growing portfolio of products and a wider geographical sales reach for these products.
Wholesale
Our Wholesale division focuses on the sale of thirdparty veterinary pharmaceuticals supplies and instruments in Belgium.
Based close to Bruges in the North West of Belgium this business supplies veterinary professionals across the country and has been trading for 25 years and is well established in a stable market.
The extensive range of over 5000 products includes own label and branded items ranging from small disposable items to larger capital equipment and diagnostic instruments.
The division also specialises in the supply of surgical instruments.
Revenues increased by 9.7% entirely through organic growth to 23.9m 2016 21.8m with this division representing 28.6% of total Group sales.
This division delivered underlying and reported EBITDA of 0.3m 2016 0.5m reflecting the investment made in sales staff to drive future growth.
Growth was driven by the addition of new customers as well as expanding the range of products sold to existing customers.
Product Development Pipeline The focus on building value within our product development pipeline continues.
As an enlarged business our development team is located across a number of sites providing extensive skills and capabilities across Belgium Germany Spain and UK.
Karolyn Tapper previously Director of Business Development for Animalcare Ltd has been appointed to the new role of Group Head of Technical and Commercial Development to structure and integrate the teams to ensure that we continue to grow through investing in and attracting new product opportunities.
14 26011 Proof 4 A project rationalisation and prioritisation process for all projects across the Group has been undertaken.
Within the context of the enlarged Group technical feasibility development costs and commercial forecasts have been reviewed thoroughly to determine which projects would be continued.
The Company is currently focused on 17 active new product development pipeline projects within Spain and UK.
In 2017 we launched Acecare a sedative from the original UK pipeline.
Sales have been in line with the original project forecast.
One centralised registration was submitted in 2017 and launch of this product is planned in late 2018.
Progress of the pipeline continues and in 2018 three new products have already been registered across Europe with additional submissions planned throughout the year.
Alongside the new product development pipeline a number of product improvement and product maintenance projects are ongoing.
Several registrations to expand the global presence of our products were made in 2017 and launch within new territories is planned at the end of 2018 and during 2019.
New Products through Strategic Alliances and Partnerships In addition to broadening our product portfolio through our own development pipeline we are aware that our wide geographical footprint is attractive to similar companies in the US and Asia who are seeking routes to market for their products across Europe.
During the period we have seen the first result of this strategy with an agreement with USbased Nutramax to provide Europe wide distribution of their nutritional supplement Cosequin which promotes canine joint health.
People
We currently have 100 sales representatives and 28 agents across Europe having invested in an additional 6 sales representatives and support roles during the year.
As a result of changes in senior and executive management in the Company it was necessary to find and appoint new Country Managers in Spain and the UK the two key territories in the
This has been completed with the new recruits now in post in the weeks following the year end.
Internal appointments have also been made in the important areas of Technical and Product Development and Export.
These new roles will progress the integration of the Group and help us to realise commercial opportunities more quickly.
It is clear that an appointment in supply chain management will be required in the near future to ensure the operational efficiencies of the Group within this area are achieved.
In addition we announced at the end of April that Iain Menneer has stood down from his role as Chief Operating Officer.
We are very grateful for all of Iains work on the integration of Animalcare and Ecuphar and we wish him well for the future.
Iains role as COO will not be replaced and has been redistributed within the senior management team that he was accountable for who will take on further responsibilities and report directly to myself.
The key component to ensuring we continue to deliver on our longterm growth strategy is to continue to attract and retain the highest calibre people to drive forward our development.
I would like to extend my thanks to all of our staff for their hard work.
Brexit
The details of how the UK pharmaceutical regulations will be extracted from the current harmonised European structure are not yet clear.
The Veterinary Medicines Directorate UK Government agency is looking for close cooperation to enable a smooth transition to ensure animal welfare and food safety.
The recent acquisition has enabled the new Group to start restructuring its pharmaceutical licence ownership with legal entities in the UK and Europe postBrexit to allow uninterrupted commercial supply of product.
We will continue to monitor the situation and take the necessary action to ensure business continuity.
Animalcare Group plc Annual Report 2017 site Stock Code ANCR STRATEGIC REPORT OUR PERFORMANCE 26011 Proof 4 Postperiod end  Le Vet purchase by Dechra On 13 th February Dechra plc acquired Le Vet Beheer B.
Le Vet a business which has developed a portfolio of products and established a network of marketing partners across Europe.
Le Vet has been a longterm partner of Animalcare and Ecuphar with distribution agreements in four territories.
Whilst certain distribution arrangements will not change it is clear that this will not be the case across all of them.
We are taking action now to mitigate against any material change which could adversely impact trading part way through 2019.
Strategy and Outlook The strategy of the business remains focused on building long term shareholder value by creating a growing profitable and highly cash generative panEuropean animal health platform capable of investing in a steady flow of new products and rewarding shareholders with dividend payments.
Further growth is expected through the execution of a clear strategy for growth via both organic sales growth and through targeted acquisitions.
Our strategy for growth includes Crossselling opportunities across customers and distribution channels More synergies delivered through further integration of the businesses Enhancing geographic footprint and sales marketing and distribution network Developing network of partnerships  strategic alliances to increase exposure to new opportunities Identifying selective valueaccretive acquisitions Diversifying the portfolio of products into additional therapeutic areas within companion animal as well as production animal and equine markets Broadening the product development pipeline to include novel therapies We expect growth in revenues to be driven by the launch of new products from our development pipeline additional regulatory approvals for our existing products in new territories and the distribution of new products for US or Asia based third parties across our European footprint.
We also expect margin improvement to be seen as the opportunity to crosssell products fully impacts as existing distribution agreements held by our UK business for Germany Spain Portugal Italy and Belgium are exited and replaced by our own direct sales network.
We believe we are on track to deliver double digit profit growth during 2018 and enhancement to profit margins will be driven by further synergies and crossselling opportunities which will start to take effect late in 2018 as integration progresses but will deliver a more meaningful impact on profit margins during 2019 as the full effect of these changes are felt.
We believe the business is well positioned for future growth and the Directors remain confident of delivering longterm shareholder value.

This included 76.1m from the continuing Ecuphar business an increase of 11.3% 3.8% at CER and 7.6m contribution from the acquired Animalcare operations.
Underlying EBITDA increased by 11.9% to 10.0m 2016 8.9m including a 1.6m contribution from acquisition business.
Ecuphars continuing business underlying EBITDA decreased by 5.6% to 8.4m primarily reflecting the lower gross margins investments in our infrastructure and people to support future growth and the disposal of NutriScience which Ecuphar sold in October 2016 which contributed profits of approximately 0.2m.
More details regarding operational performance are provided within the Trading Performance section.
Basic underlying EPS decreased by 24.6% to 12.6 pence 2016 16.7 pence.
The 33.3% increase in profit after tax was offset by the significant increase in the weighted average number of shares from 23.8 million which has been adjusted for the merger ratio of 6337 as described in note 9 to 42.0 million.

This growth was primarily driven by very strong growth in Production Animals revenue which as an overall category increased by 25.2% versus prior year to 28.4m together with a strong contribution from the Companion Animals category.
Further detail on revenue by product category is given below.
Underlying EBITDA improved by 15.1% to 9.7m however declined by 3.6% from continuing business to 8.1m 2016 8.4m representing an EBITDA margin of 15.6% 2016 18.1%.
This decline was driven by a combination of lower gross margins which fell by 2.3% to 53.6% and a 2.3m increase in operating costs.
Gross margins in our continuing business have fallen for three main reasons Lower margin sales mix primarily reflecting higher growth in our Production Animal product category and export markets.
Maintaining market share in a competitive environment at some expense to margins.
Disposal of NutriScience in October 2016 which generated 1.3m sales at margins in excess of 50%.
Operating costs have increased by 2.3m to 19.9m 2016 17.6m representing 38.2% 2016 37.8% of sales.
Approximately
1.5m of this increase relates to investment in our infrastructure in particular IT and RandD people and marketing to position the business for future growth.
The balance of 0.8m reflects higher distribution costs as a result of significantly increased vaccine sales together with higher inventory write offs.
Reported EBITDA which includes 2.2m nonunderlying items as analysed in note 5 reduced to 7.5m 2016 10.2m.
Wholesale segment Our wholesale segment which comprises the purchase and resale of veterinary pharmaceuticals supplies and instruments in Belgium delivered revenue of 23.9m representing an increase of 9.7% on the prior year .
Whilst gross margins at 10.1% remained broadly comparable with prior year 2016 10.4% underlying and reported EBITDA reduced from 0.5m to 0.3m mainly due to increased employee costs to drive product sales and services growth.
Revenue by Product Category % Change at AER % Companion Animals 42791 30799 38.9% Production Animals 28390 22668 25.2% Equine 4718 5567 15.3% Other products and services 7777 9327 16.6% Total 83676 68361 11.3% Companion Animals revenue increased by 38.9% to 42.8m and following the reverse acquisition of Animalcare Group plc now represents 51.1% of total business up from 45.1% in the prior year.
Animalcare revenues generated 24.5% of the growth with the balance of 14.4% delivered by existing business primarily driven by increased export sales increased wholesale sales and market penetration of core pharmaceuticals.
Production Animals revenue grew by 25.2% on prior year despite ongoing pressure on antibiotic usage.
This growth largely came from full year sales of new products launched in 2016 in particular rabbit vaccines and continued growth of core products in both our established markets as well as newer geographies such as Italy.
Equine revenues reduced to 4.7m due to the prior year oneoff benefit of horse vaccine sales in Germany as a result of competitor supply issues.
Reported Financial Results Given the significant changes to the Group following the reverse acquisition the financial results contain a number of non underlying items comprising the fair value uplift of inventory acquired amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles and acquisition and integration costs.

Nonunderlying items incurred in the year are summarised below all figures are pretax Fair value adjustment of acquired inventory of 0.4m  this is a noncash uplift to the value of acquisition inventory as a result of the fair value exercise carried out in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
Amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles totalling 4.3m  this comprises 1.7m charge arising on the acquired intangibles relating to the Animalcare reverse acquisition and 2.6m in relation to previous acquisitions made by Ecuphar NV principally Esteve SA which was acquired on 30 th April 2015.
Acquisition and integration costs of 1.8m  this principally includes the transaction costs borne by Ecuphar NV in relation to the reverse acquisition of Animalcare Group plc and postacquisition integration costs including the internal transfer of Animalcare Ltd to Ecuphar NV and the setup of a new longterm incentive plan which the Board is seeking to implement during 2018.
Earnings per Share and Dividend Basic underlying EPS decreased by 24.6% to 12.6pence 2016 16.7 pence.
The 33.3% increase in profit after tax was offset by the significant increase in the weighted average number of shares from 23.8 million which has been adjusted for the merger ratio of 6337 as described in note 8 to 42.0 million.
The reported basic EPS which incorporates nonunderlying items decreased to 0.4 pence 2016 14.8 pence The Board is proposing a final dividend of 2.0 pence per share added to the second interim dividend of 4.7 pence per share paid in November 2017 giving a total dividend of 6.7 pence per share since the reverse acquisition.
This final dividend is subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting on 27th June 2017.
The Board will continue to maintain the current dividend policy and timing of payments whilst continuing to invest for future growth.
Cash Flow Net Debt and Borrowing Facilities Net debt at 1 st January 2017 23782 Net cash generated from operations 2425 Net capital expenditure 2532 Acquisition of subsidiaries net of cash acquired 26852 Receipts from issue of share capital 29402 Net finance expenses 657 Dividends paid 2816 Other cash movements 45 Foreign exchange on cash and borrowings 1051 Net debt at 31 st December 2017 25908 20 26011 Proof 4 The Group generated 2.4m net cash from operations 2016 9.3m which includes a cash outflow from nonunderlying items totalling 3.8m.
Working capital increased by 5.6m principally reflecting the payment of 2.5m nonunderlying items which were recognised accrued at the time of the reverse acquisition 2.0m increase in trade receivables due to strong growth in the final quarter and 1.4m investment in stock.
This stock increase was mainly within our wholesale operation due to anticipated further antibiotic restrictions with the balance largely in our highgrowth territories.
Net capital expenditure of 2.5m largely comprises investment in our product development pipeline from which a significant number of new products launches are expected in 2019 and 2020.
The 33.1m cash consideration for the acquisition of Ecuphar NV was funded using 4.0m of cash held by Animalcare Group plc and 29.1m of equity raised through a placing net of 0.9m expenses.
As part of the reverse acquisition the Group agreed to maintain the existing Ecuphar NV borrowing facilities the Facilities through four banks which comprised i 41.5m revolving credit facility RCF ii 10m term facility to finance permitted acquisitions Term Loan A and iii 4.08m quarterly amortising term facility Term Loan B.
There are three covenants governing the facilities a minimum adjusted solvency ratio of 30% measured as consolidated adjusted equity to consolidated adjusted total assets ii a maximum leverage ratio of 3.5 times measured as consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA iii a minimum interest coverage ratio of 4 times measured as consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expenses.
Based on the 12 months unaudited proforma underlying EBITDA of 11.8m see below the Groups net debt underlying EBITDA leverage ratio was 2.2 times.
At 31 st December 2017 total facilities were 48.4m of which 33.5m net of cash balances was being utilised leaving headroom of 14.9m.
These bank facilities together with the Groups operational cash flow indicate that the Group has sufficient facilities available to fund its operations and allow for future expansion.
Summary
The transformational reverse acquisition of Ecuphar has created critical scale for the Group within the European animal health market providing a strengthened position to capitalise on growth in the market to deliver longterm shareholder value.
To support this value creation and to maximise the commercial operational and financial synergies the Group must deliver a wide ranging and comprehensive integration.
The historical growth of Ecuphar was complemented by a series of acquisitions including the largest and most significant acquisition of Esteve in 2015.
Prior to the reverse limited integration of these operations was undertaken.
This has presented additional challenges resulting in the current process to integrate the businesses taking longer than expected.
From a financial performance perspective we have delivered strong revenue growth however this has not translated through to our operating profit as we have experienced competitive market pressures and changing sales mix leading to margin decline in the second half of 2017.
Against this backdrop our priorities for the current year are Increasing sales of new products from our distribution network and expanding our geographic footprint Focusing on gross margin and EBITDA development in order to deliver anticipated profit growth Improving operating cash generation important in providing the business with the funds to continue the momentum in our product development pipeline together with dividend flow Delivering integration to unlock scale benefits and support EBITDA We remain firm in our belief that the reverse acquisition will provide a number of opportunities for growth.
Delivering the comprehensive integration to realise the synergies and benefits available is key.
Ultimately to create value the combination of our businesses must become more than the sum of the parts.
We expect to see some benefits of the integration in the current year but a more meaningful impact on profit in 2019.
Once fully integrated we believe this will provide a strong platform for longterm value creation for our shareholders.

This is shown in further detail in the reconciliation section below.
On the proforma basis revenue increased by 9.6% 3.4% at CER to 91.9m however underlying EBITDA decreased by 8.5% 12.9% decrease at CER to 11.8m.
The principal drivers for the financial performance of the existing Ecuphar business are described earlier in the Trading Performance section.
For the acquired Animalcare business revenues increased 1.7% to 15.8m driven by 0.6m growth within export offset by a 0.4m reduction in sales from our microchipping business the latter primarily as a result of the 0.3m incremental sales benefit observed in 2016 following the introduction of compulsory microchipping in the UK.
Gross profit was flat at 8.7m largely reflecting the changing sales mix towards lower margin export business.
Operating expenses excluding nonunderlying items increased by 0.4m of which approximately half relates to higher central costs including the enlarged Board.
The balance primarily relates to investment in our UK trading business staff base.
As a result underlying EBITDA fell by 0.6m to 3.3m.
The proforma results are yet to reflect the benefits from leveraging the Groups enlarged platform which include commercial synergies operating efficiencies and optimisation of the RandD function.
We will continue to deliver the integration throughout 2018 to deliver more significant value creation from 2019.

CHRIS BREWSTER CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER Animalcare Group plc Annual Report 2017 site Stock Code ANCR STRATEGIC REPORT OUR PERFORMANCE 26011 Proof 4 OUR PRINCIPAL RISKS
Risk Management Framework
The Board is responsible for maintaining and reviewing the effectiveness of our risk management activities intended to monitor and mitigate rather than eliminate the significant risks that the Group is exposed to.
In accordance with our governance practices the Audit Committee supports the Board of Directors in monitoring the Groups risks and is responsible for reviewing the effectiveness of the risk management and internal control systems.
Our Risks A summary of the principal risks together with an explanation of how the Group mitigates each risk their trend and linkage to our strategy are set out in the table below.
RISK
ALIGNMENT
TO STRATEGY POTENTIAL IMPACT MITIGATION TREND Competitor risk Launch of competitor products for example other generic or more superior product profile.
Our product portfolio is broad however contains products with strong market share which is attractive to competitors.
Revenues and gross margins may be adversely affected should competitors launch competing generic or superior novel products.
Operating costs may increase to protect market share.
We monitor new product registrations and competitor launches and develop commercial and marketing responses accordingly.
Diversification of our product portfolio and geographies will lessen the impact on our business.
Market risk In certain geographies the veterinary market continues to see the emergence and growth of buying groups and corporate customers who are looking for value from the products and services we provide.
The emergence and growth of corporate customers and buying groups represents an opportunity for sales volume growth but may result in lower margins.
We continue to develop and strengthen our sales and marketing teams in respect of key account support and achieve our goal to better serve our changing customer base both on a national and in future a European basis.
Integration risk The integration of Ecuphar and Animalcare is wide ranging and may fail to deliver expected returns due to integration challenges.
Failure to deliver the integration to the expected timetable together with anticipated commercial and operational synergies will inhibit growth and lead to higher costs and lower than expected profits.
An integration plan has been prepared and is being implemented across key work streams including supply chain technical and product development finance HR export and IT.
Product development risk Pharmaceutical development is complex involving technical regulatory and financial risk.
Failure to successfully deliver new product development projects could have a material impact on the Groups results and damage our market position and relationship with our customers.
Complete failure of a project or failure to meet commercial expectations due to for example competitor launches generic or novel would result in impairment of capitalised development costs.
Following careful selection of development strategy each new product development project undergoes rigorous review by the crossdiscipline senior management team with final signoff by the Board.
The pipeline is reviewed regularly with corresponding updates provided to the Board to ensure each project is progressing according to plan.
Key
Up Down Same 24 26011 Proof 4
ALIGNMENT
TO STRATEGY POTENTIAL IMPACT MITIGATION TREND Reliance on third parties risk The supply of products to our customers in a timely manner is vital to the success of the Group.
The Group does not manufacture any of its own products and is solely reliant on an increasing third party supplier and contract manufacturer base across the UK and Europe.
Any disruption to the relationship with our key supply partners whether commercial or via change of control or interruption to the supply chain could result in significant loss of revenue and damage the Groups reputation with its customers.
Given the increasing complexity and diversity in our supply chain we have identified the need for increased specialist resource in this area which will form part of the integration.
We monitor supplier performance and maintain adequate inventories including safety stock held by our suppliers based on risk assessments.
Regulatory risk Continuing pressure to reduce antibiotic usage and resistance.
In certain countries this has led to increasing government intervention to limit the use of antibiotics in food producing animals.
Decline in sales of our antibiotic product range.
Regular dialogue is maintained with relevant authorities in each country to ensure we maintain a thorough understanding of regulatory changes.
We aim to sell products that minimise antimicrobial resistance concerns.
People risk The Group has a small Executive and senior management team whose skills knowledge experience and performance make a large contribution to the success of the Group.
Failure to retain and attract high calibre individuals in key roles could impact the successful implementation of our strategy and adversely impact on our results.
The Nomination Committee leads the process for all potential appointments to the Board.
Remuneration packages are reviewed annually to help ensure that the Group has the right mix of base salary and shortterm and longterm incentives to attract retain and reward key employees to execute our growth strategy.

This is closed to new members and no further options will be granted under the LTIP 2014.
In 2014 Iain Menneer and Chris Brewster were granted the following options Iain Menneer  31955 A Ordinary Shares of 1.00 each A Shares for a total cash subscription of 31955 representing 5.2% of Animalcare Ltds issued share capital and Chris Brewster  19173 A Shares representing 3% of Animalcare Ltds issued share capital and 11800 B Ordinary Shares of 1.00 each B Shares representing a further 2% of Animalcare Ltds issued share capital for a total cash subscription of 30973.
The total cash subscriptions were based on independent valuation considered to be equal to fair value at the time of acquisition.
Both Directors had the right to sell their A Shares to the Company at any time after 27 th June 2017 in exchange for Ordinary Shares of 20 pence each in the Company Ordinary
Their rights to sell the A Shares are subject to amongst other provisions the Company having a market capitalisation in excess of 39.0m the Hurdle at the time of sale.
The
Hurdle was determined by the Remuneration Committee and broadly represented a 20% premium to the Companys market capitalisation on 27 th June 2014.
Each holder of A Shares would on a sale of his entire holding to the Company be entitled to receive Ordinary Shares representing a percentage of the increase in the Companys market capitalisation above the Hurdle being 5% for Iain Menneer and 3% for Chris Brewster.

In June 2017 it was agreed between the Company Iain Menneer and Chris Brewster that the options under the LTIP 2014 did not become exercisable as a result of the acquisition of Ecuphar NV.
The Company however determined that it was appropriate to offer the right to exchange their shares in Animalcare Limited for Ordinary Shares shortly before completion of the acquisition and each took up that right.
As a consequence 918896 new Ordinary Shares were issued to Iain Menneer and Chris Brewster on th July 2017.
The number of new Ordinary Shares issued pursuant to the exercise of these rights was determined using the lower of the closing middle market price for an Ordinary Share on nd June 2017 being the dealing day before the date the offer to exchange was made and the average of the closing middle market prices for an Ordinary Share over the dealing days in the 30 day period before that date being 392.5 pence.

CHRIS BREWSTER CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER AND COMPANY SECRETARY th May 2018 26011 Proof 4 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ANIMALCARE GROUP PLC Report on the audit of the financial statements
In our opinion Animalcare Group plcs Group financial statements and Company financial statements the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Groups and of the Companys affairs as at 31 st December 2017 and of the Groups profit and the Groups and the Companys cash flows for the period then ended have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as regards the Companys financial statements as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
We have audited the financial statements included within the Annual Report which comprise the Group and parent Company statements of financial position as at 31 st December 2017 the Group income statement and statement of comprehensive income the Group and parent Company statements of cash flows and the Group and parent Company statements of changes in equity for the period then ended and the notes to the financial statements which include a description of the significant accounting policies.
Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing UK ISAs UK and applicable law.
Our
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK which includes the FRCs Ethical Standard as applicable to listed entities and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
Our audit approach
Materiality
Audit scope
Audit
Ma  er s Overall Group materiality 255000 based on 2.5% of Adjusted EBITDA.
Overall Company materiality 100000 based on the lower of component and statutory materiality statutory materiality based on 0.5% of net assets.
We as the Group engagement team audited the two components based in the UK  being Animalcare Group plc and Animalcare Limited.
The components based overseas  being Ecuphar NV Medini NV Othopaedics and Ecuphar Spain  have been audited by PwC component auditors.
We were heavily involved at all stages of their audits by virtue of numerous communications throughout the process including the issuance of detailed audit instructions review and discussion of audit findings in particular over our areas of focus.
As a result of this scoping we obtained coverage over 77% of the Groups external revenues and 88% of the Groups EBITDA.
Accounting for the reverse acquisition of Ecuphar NV Group and parent.
Accounting for complex customer arrangements Group.
Carrying value of intangibles in relation to New Product Development Group.
The scope of our audit As part of designing our audit we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements.
In particular we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.
As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the Directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
Animalcare Group plc Annual Report 2017 site Stock Code ANCR OUR FINANCIALS 41 26011 Proof 4 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ANIMALCARE GROUP PLC Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that in the auditors professional judgement were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement whether or not due to fraud identified by the auditors including those which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter Accounting for the reverse acquisition of Ecuphar N.
On 13 th July 2017 the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Ecuphar NV via a shareforshare exchange.
In line with the requirements of IFRS 3 this is being accounted for as a reverse acquisition given the relative size of Ecuphar NV in comparison to Animalcare Group plc.
We focused on this area because the accounting for acquisitions involves judgement and estimates that have a material impact on the amounts recognised in the Group Financial Statements including determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired which largely consists of Animalcare Group plcs proprietary product portfolio and pipeline of new products and the useful economic lives of these identified intangibles determining the fair value of other assets and liabilities acquired and determining the appropriate disclosures and accounting treatment in relation to the reverse acquisition.
We obtained and read the relevant terms of the purchase agreements to inform our further audit procedures to test the accounting for the acquisition.
We tested the recognition in the Consolidated Financial Statements of the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired and residual goodwill.
In doing so we tested the valuation of the acquired intangibles by testing if the assumptions used in the calculations were consistent with our understanding of the acquisition and through agreement to supporting evidence.
In addition we utilised our internal valuation experts to assess the reasonableness of the valuation methodology and other key assumptions driving the valuation specifically the discount rate applied.
We found no inconsistencies in the assumptions used in the valuation and considered whether any other intangible assets should have been identified based on our understanding of the transaction our knowledge of the business the purchase agreements and discussions with the Directors we did not identify any.
We have also reviewed the financial statement disclosures to ensure that the reverse acquisition is appropriately disclosed in line with IFRS we did not identify any issues.
Accounting for complex customer arrangements The Group provide rebate discounts and equipment deals to buying groups corporate owned veterinary practices and independent veterinary practices.
These are contractual and vary by customer and product type.
We focused on this area because the amount of customer rebates payable in respect of the year is determined by the contract terms for each customer which are negotiated separately and as a result differ from one another.
This means that the calculation of the rebates recognised in the Income Statement and as a payable at the year end relies on a manual process which is inherently more prone to error than systems based processes.
We also focused on the completeness of the Income Statement charge and year end provision due to the risk of potential omission given the manual nature of the process.
To test customer rebates we recalculated for a sample of customers the customer rebate expense recognised within the Income Statement in the year and provided for at the Balance Sheet date finding them to be broadly consistent tested whether any rebate arrangements had been omitted from the amounts charged in the year and liabilities held at the Balance Sheet date by checking the contractual arrangements with the Groups most significant customers to make sure that all rebate arrangements had been identified by the Directors and did not identify any that had been omitted and agreed amounts settled with customers post period end to source documentation credit notes and cash payment to check they had been accounted for in the right accounting period and found no instances of amounts recorded in the wrong period.
42 26011 Proof 4 Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter Carrying value of intangibles in relation to New Product Development New Product Development expenditure is capitalised and amortised over the estimated economic life of the product when the relevant criteria of IAS 38 Intangible assets are met.
Judgement is required when assessing the technical and commercial feasibility of New Product Development projects including whether regulatory approval will be achieved.
Given the level of judgement involved we have focused on this area.
The risk we focused on is that the carrying value of these intangibles may be overstated and that an impairment charge may be required.
To assess the carrying value of intangibles in relation to New Product Development we have tested a sample of costs capitalised during the year to assess whether these have been appropriately treated in line with the Groups accounting policy and accounting standards most notably IAS 38 Intangible assets and noted no issues met with management responsible for the particular costs to obtain an understanding of the associated project and to independently assess whether project costs meet the criteria for capitalisation as set out in accounting standards we agreed with managements judgements reviewed managements feasibility analysis for ongoing new product development projects which considers the payback period being the point in time when the New Product Development will turn a profit based on its expected future earnings potential.
This has been reviewed to assess the carrying value of the related intangible assets with no issues noted and determined that the disclosure detailed within note 10 is consistent with the requirements of IAS 38 Intangible assets.
How we tailored the audit scope We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole taking into account the structure of the Group and the Company the accounting processes and controls and the industry in which they operate.
The Group operates through 13 components in a number of different countries.
The procedures performed over the components either by the Group team or PwC component audit teams accounted for 77% of the Groups external revenues and 88% of the Groups EBITDA.
We as the Group engagement team tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole taking into account the geographic structure of the Group the accounting processes and controls and the industry in which the Group operates.
We as the Group engagement team performed an audit of the complete financial information for the two UK components  Animalcare Group plc and Animalcare Limited.
For the remaining components of the Group being Ecuphar NV Medini NV Othopaedics and Ecuphar Spain PwC component auditors under our instructions performed an audit of their complete financial information.
Where the work was performed by PwC component auditors we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work at those components to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole.
We were involved at all stages of their audits by virtue of numerous communications throughout the process including the issuance of detailed audit instructions review and discussion of audit findings in particular over our areas of focus.
We as the Group engagement team were also responsible for other head office activities such as the Purchase Price Allocation in relation to the reverse acquisition of Ecuphar and the financial statement disclosures.
The procedures performed over the components either by the Group team or PwC component audit teams accounted for 77% of the Groups external revenues and 88% of the Groups EBITDA.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality.
We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality.
These together with qualitative considerations helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.
Animalcare Group plc Annual Report 2017 site Stock Code ANCR OUR FINANCIALS 43 26011 Proof 4 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ANIMALCARE GROUP PLC Based on our professional judgement we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows Group financial statements Company financial statements Overall materiality 255000 100000 How we determined it 2.5% of Adjusted EBITDA.
Based on the lower of component and statutory materiality statutory materiality based on 0.5% of net assets.
Rationale for benchmark applied Based on the benchmarks used in the Annual Report EBITDA is the primary measure used by the shareholders in assessing the performance of the Group and is a generally accepted auditing benchmark.
We believe that net assets is considered to be appropriate as it is not a profitoriented company.
The Company holds the investments in subsidiaries and therefore net assets is deemed a generally accepted auditing benchmark.
For each component in the scope of our Group audit we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality.
The range of materiality allocated across components was between 100000 and 240000.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above 13000 Group audit and 13000 Company audit as well as misstatements below those amounts that in our view warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Conclusions relating to going concern We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which ISAs UK require us to report to you when the Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate or the Directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the Groups and Companys ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
However because not all future events or conditions can be predicted this statement is not a guarantee as to the Groups and Companys ability to continue as a going concern.
Reporting on other information The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors report thereon.
The Directors are responsible for the other information.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and accordingly we do not express an audit opinion or except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report any form of assurance thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements our responsibility is to read the other information and in doing so consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information.
If based on the work we have performed we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors Report we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit ISAs UK require us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below.
44 26011 Proof 4 Strategic Report and Directors Report In our opinion based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors Report for the year ended 31 December 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors Report.
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors Responsibilities the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements the Directors are responsible for assessing the Groups and the Companys ability to continue as a going concern disclosing as applicable matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditors report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs UK will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if individually or in the aggregate they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRCs website at www. rc. iteauditorsresponsibilities.
This description forms part of our auditors report.
Use of this report This report including the opinions has been prepared for and only for the Companys members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose.
We do not in giving these opinions accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Other required reporting Companies Act 2006 exception reporting Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if in our opinion we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit or adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us or certain disclosures of Directors remuneration specified by law are not made or the Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

The Group comprises Animalcare Group plc and its subsidiaries.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in note 6 and within the Directors Report.
Details of the subsidiaries can be found in note 27.
2 Basis of Preparation The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors under the historical cost convention except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union adopted IFRSs the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting under IFRS and the IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretation.
They have also been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the AIM Rules.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in thousands of pound sterling K or thousands of  and all currency values are rounded to the nearest thousand 000 except when otherwise indicated.
The preparation of financial statements in compliance with adopted IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires Group management to exercise judgement in applying the Groups accounting policies.
The areas where significant judgement and estimates have been made in preparing the financial statements and their effect are disclosed in Note 3.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently.
On 13 th July 2017 the Company acquired the entire issued ordinary share capital of Ecuphar NV and became the legal parent of Ecuphar NV.
The accounting policy adopted by the Directors applies the principles of IFRS 3 Revised Business Combinations in identifying the accounting parent as Ecuphar NV and the presentation of the Group consolidated statements of the Company the legal parent as a continuation of financial statements of the accounting parent or legal subsidiary Ecuphar NV.
This policy reflects the commercial substance of this transaction as follows The original shareholders of the legal subsidiary undertaking were the most significant shareholders following admission to AIM owning 46.9% of the issued share capital The assets and liabilities of the legal subsidiary Ecuphar NV are recognised and measured in the Group financial statements at the precombination carrying amounts without restatement to fair value The retained earnings and other equity balances recognised in the Group financial statements reflect the retained earnings and other equity balances of Ecuphar NV immediately before the business combination The results of the period from 1 st January 2017 to the date of the business combination are those of Ecuphar NV The equity structure appearing in the Group financial statements reflects the equity structure of the legal parent including the equity instruments issued under the share forshare exchange to effect the business combination and adjusted in accordance with IFRS 3.
This results in the creation of a reverse acquisition reserve as at 1 st January 2017 being the difference between the Company equity structure and that of Ecuphar NV.
The consolidated financial statements cover the year ended st December 2017.
The financial statements for the comparative year ended 31 st December 2016 represent the substance of the reverse acquisition and are those of Ecuphar NV.
3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Going concern An analysis of the factors likely to impact on the Groups future business activities performance and strategy are set out in the
Chief Executives Review and Chief Financial Officers Review.
The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 01 to 25.
For the purposes of their assessment of the appropriateness of the preparation of the Groups accounts on a going concern basis the Directors have considered the current cash position and forecasts of future trading including working capital and investment requirements.
During the year the Group met its daytoday general corporate and working capital requirements through existing cash resources.
At 31 st December 2017 the Group had cash on hand of 7579k 2016 951k.
Overall the Directors believe the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
The Groups forecasts and projections taking account of reasonable possible changes in trading performance show that the Group should have sufficient cash resources to meet its requirements for at least the next 12 months.
Accordingly the adoption of the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements remains appropriate.
Basis for consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Group and its subsidiaries.
52 26011 Proof 4 Entities are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition which is the date when the Group obtains control and continue to be consolidated until the date when such control ceases.
The financial statements of the entities are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent Company using consistent accounting policies.
All intraGroup balances transactions unrealised gains and losses resulting from intraGroup transactions and dividends are fully eliminated.
The Group attributes profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income to the owners of the parent Company and to the noncontrolling interest based on present ownership interests even if the results in the noncontrolling interest have a negative balance.
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary without a loss of control is accounted for as an equity transaction.
If the Group loses control over the subsidiary it will derecognise the assets including goodwill and liabilities of the subsidiary any non controlling interest and the other components that are equity related to the subsidiary.
Any surplus or deficit arising from the loss of control is recognised in profit or loss.
If the Group retains an interest in the previous subsidiary then such interest is measured at fair value at the date the control is lost.
The proportion allocated to the parent and noncontrolling interests in preparing the consolidated financial statements is determined based solely on present ownership interests.
Nonunderlying items Nonunderlying items are material items of income or expense which because of their nature and the expected frequency of the events giving rise to them merit separate disclosure.
Other items relates to the amortisation of acquired intangible assets and fair value movements on foreign exchange hedging instruments.
The separate presentation of exceptional and other items enables the users of the accounts to better understand the elements of trading performance during the year and hence to better assess trends in that performance.
Noncontrolling interests The Group has the choice on a transaction by transaction basis to initially recognise any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree which is a present ownership interest and entitles its holders to a proportionate share of the entitys net assets in the event of liquidation at either acquisition date fair value or at the present ownership instruments proportionate share in the recognised amounts of the acquirees identifiable net assets.
Other components of noncontrolling interest such as outstanding share options are generally measured at fair value.
The Group has not elected to take the option to use fair value in acquisitions completed to date and currently only has minor noncontrolling interest resulting from business combinations.
Segment reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker.
The chief operating decisionmaker who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments has been identified as the Executive Committee.
Operating segments are aggregated when they have similar economic characteristics which is the case when there is similarity in terms of a the nature of the products and services b the nature of the production processes c the type or class of customer for their products and services d the methods used to distribute their products or provide their services and e if applicable the nature of the regulatory environment.
The Group has two operating segments Pharmaceutical and Wholesale.
Foreign currency translation Functional and presentation currency The Groups consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling GBP which is the Groups presentational currency.
For each entity the Group determines the functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using the functional currency.
The functional currency of most subsidiaries of the Group is Euros.
The statement of financial position is translated into GBP at the closing rate on the reporting date and their income statement is translated at the average exchange rate at yearend.
Differences resulting from the translation of the financial statements of the parent and the subsidiaries are recognised in other comprehensive income as cumulative translation differences.
Foreign currency transactions Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Euros at the exchange rate at the end of the previous month end.
Monetary items in the statement of financial position are translated at the closing rate at each reporting date and the relevant translation adjustments are recognised in financial or operating result depending on its nature.
Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method at the acquisition date which is the date at which the Group obtains control over the entity.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the amount of the consideration transferred to the seller measured at the acquisition date fair value and the amount of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree.
Animalcare Group plc Annual Report 2017 site Stock Code ANCR OUR FINANCIALS 53 26011 Proof 4 3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are with limited exceptions measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
The
Group recognises any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity on an acquisitionbyacquisition basis either at fair value or at the noncontrolling interests proportionate share of the acquired entitys net identifiable assets.
The Group measures goodwill initially at cost at the acquisition date being the fair value of the consideration transferred to the seller plus the amount of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree plus if the business combination is achieved in stages the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree remeasured at the acquisition date less the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired and assumed liabilities.
Goodwill is recognised as an intangible asset with any impairment in carrying value being charged to the consolidated income statement.
Where the fair value of identifiable assets liabilities and contingent liabilities exceed the fair value of consideration paid the excess is credited in full to the consolidated income statement on acquisition date.
Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in general and administrative expenses.
Property plant and equipment Property plant and equipment is stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation andor accumulated impairment losses if any.
Such cost includes borrowing costs directly attributable to construction projects if the asset necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use it is probable that they will result in future economic benefits to the Group and the cost can be measured reliably.
When significant parts of property plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals the Group recognises such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and depreciates them accordingly.
Likewise when a major inspection is performed its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the property plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied.
All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Depreciation is calculated on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows Equipment 5 years Office furniture and office equipment 35 years or lease term if shorter Leased equipment 45 years Leasehold improvements 5 years or lease term if shorter Land is not depreciated.
A leased asset is depreciated over the useful life of the asset.
However if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term the asset is depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term.
An item of property plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal.
Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset is included in the income statement when the asset is derecognised.
The assets residual values useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed at each financial yearend and adjusted prospectively if appropriate.
Leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is or contains a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at the inception date whether fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset even if that right is not explicitly specified in an arrangement.
Finance leases which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item are capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the fair value of the leased item or if lower at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are recognised as financial expenses in the consolidated income statement.
Where substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are not transferred to the Group an operating lease the total rentals payable under the lease are charged to the consolidated income statement on a straightline basis over the lease term.
The aggregate benefit of lease incentives is recognised as a reduction of the rental expense over the lease term on a straightline basis.
Intangible assets Intangible assets comprise the acquired product portfolios inprocess research and development licensing and distribution rights and customer acquired in connection with business combinations product portfolios and product development costs and capitalised software.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED YEAR ENDED 31 S T DECEMBER 2017 54 26011 Proof 4 The useful life of the intangible assets is as follows Capitalised software 5 years Patents distribution rights and licenses 712 years Product portfolios and product development 10 years Inprocess research and development Not amortised Goodwill Not amortised.
Intangible assets acquired separately Intangible assets with finite useful lives which are acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over their useful economic lives and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.
The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period.
The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the consolidated income statement based on its function which may be cost of sales sales and marketing expenses research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives that are acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill
Goodwill is not amortised but it is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill is allocated to cashgenerating units for the purpose of impairment testing.
The allocation is made to those cash generating units or groups of cashgenerating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
The units or groups of units are identified at the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes being the operating segments.
Internally generated intangible assets  research and development expenditures Research and development includes the costs incurred by activities related to the development of software solutions new products updates and enhancements guides and other products.
Expenditures in research and development activities are recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
Development activities involve the application of research findings or other knowledge to a plan or a design of new or substantially improved software products before the start of the commercial use.
Internal development expenditures on an individual project are recognised as an intangible asset when the Group can demonstrate the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that the asset will be available for use or sale its intention to complete and its ability to use or sell the asset how the asset will generate future economic benefits the availability of resources to complete the asset the ability to measure reliably the expenditure during development.
Internal development expenditures not satisfying the above criteria and expenditures on the research phase are recognised in the consolidated income statement as incurred.
Subsequent to initial recognition internally generated intangible assets are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses on the same basis as intangible assets which are acquired separately.
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognised separately from goodwill are initially recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date which is regarded as their cost.
Subsequent to initial recognition intangible assets acquired in a business combination are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses on the same basis as intangible assets which are acquired separately.
Impairment of nonfinancial assets Impairment tests on goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful economic lives are undertaken annually at the financial year end.
Other nonfinancial assets are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount i. sell the asset is written down accordingly.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset the impairment test is carried out on the smallest group of assets to which it belongs for which there are separately identifiable cash flows its cashgenerating units CGUs.
Goodwill is allocated on initial recognition to each of the Groups CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination giving rise to the goodwill.
Animalcare Group plc Annual Report 2017 site Stock Code ANCR OUR FINANCIALS 55 26011 Proof 4 3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations which are prepared separately for each of the Groups CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated.
These budgets and forecast calculations generally cover a period of five years.
For longer periods a longterm growth rate is calculated and applied to future cash flows projected after the fifth year.
Impairment charges are included in profit or loss except where applicable to the extent they reverse gains previously recognised in other comprehensive income.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed.
Where goodwill forms part of a cashgenerating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation.
Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cashgenerating unit retained.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition are accounted for as follows Raw materials purchase cost on a first in first out basis Goods purchased for resale purchase cost on a first in first out basis.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Financial assets Financial assets include loans deposits receivables measured at amortised cost and availableforsale financial investments measured at fair value.
Financial assets measured at amortised cost The Group has loans and receivables that are measured at amortised cost.
The Groups loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables other financial assets and cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand deposits held at call with banks other shortterm highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and  for the purpose of the statement of cash flows  bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts are shown within loans and borrowings in current liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial position.
Financial assets that are classified as loans and receivables are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method EIR.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR.
The EIR amortisation is included under financial income in the consolidated income statement.
The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the consolidated income statement under other operating expenses or financial expenses.
Availableforsale financial assets measured at fair value Availableforsale financial assets relate to investments that are not initially acquired in view of a shortterm sale shares and securities and that are not fully consolidated nor equity consolidated.
Assets in this category are measured at fair value with the resulting gains and losses being directly recognised in other comprehensive income equity.
Assets in this category are measured at cost when there is no price input available in an active market and the fair value cannot be measured reliably by applying alternative valuation methods.
Impairment of financial assets The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.
A financial asset or a group of financial assets is to be impaired if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset an incurred loss event and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or the group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
In cases of availableforsale financial assets objective evidence would include a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the investment below its cost.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows excluding future expected credit losses that have not yet been incurred or its current fair value in cases of availableforsale financial assets.
The present value of the estimated future cash flows is discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate.
If a loan has a variable interest rate the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of loss is recognised in the income statement.
In the event of an impairment loss for availableforsale financial assets the accumulated impairment loss is removed from other comprehensive income and recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
Impairment losses on availableforsale financial assets are not reversed.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED YEAR ENDED 31 S T DECEMBER 2017 56 26011 Proof 4 Financial liabilities The Group has financial liabilities measured at amortised cost which include loans and borrowings trade payables and other payables and financial liabilities resulting from an interest rate swap classified as held for trading.
Financial liabilities at amortised cost Those financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs and are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the effective interest rate method amortisation process.
Derivative financial liabilities The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge the exposure to changes in interest rates however the use of derivatives is limited and does not represent significant amounts.
Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value.
After initial recognition the financial instruments are measured at fair value on the balance sheet date.
Such hedging transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting criteria although they offer economic hedging according to the Groups risk policy.
Changes in the fair value of such instruments are recognised directly in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
Derecognition
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the consolidated statement of financial position if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
Share capital Financial instruments issued by the Group are classified as equity only to the extent that they do not meet the definition of a financial liability or financial asset.
The Groups ordinary shares are classified as equity instruments.
Dividends
Dividends paid are recognised within the statement of changes in equity only when an obligation to pay the dividends arises prior to the year end.
Sharebased payments The Group issues equitysettled sharebased payments to certain employees.
Equitysettled sharebased payments are measured at fair value excluding the effect of nonmarketbased vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of such equitysettled sharebased payments is expensed on a straightline basis over the vesting period based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of nonmarketbased vesting conditions with a corresponding movement in equity.
Fair value is measured by use of the BlackScholes model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted based on managements best estimate for the effects of nontransferability exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The fair value of the shares issued under the new Long Term Incentive Plan were valued on a discounted cash flow basis in conjunction with a third party valuation specialist.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Employee benefits Shortterm employee benefits The Group has shortterm employee benefits which are recognised when the service is performed as a liability and expense.
The shortterm employee benefit is the undiscounted amount expected to be paid.
Management incentive plans The Group has implemented an incentive plan for some of its employees.
The liability recognised is the undiscounted amount expected to be paid.
Postemployment benefits The Group has a defined contribution obligation where the Group pays contributions based on salaries to an insurance company in accordance with the laws and agreements in each country.
The Belgian defined contribution pension plans are by law subject to minimum guaranteed rates of return currently 3.25% on employer contributions and 3.75% on employee contributions.
These rates have been modified by the law of 18 th December 2015 and effective for contributions paid as from 2016 to a new variable minimum return based on the Belgian government bonds with a minimum of 1.75% and a maximum of 3.75%.
Animalcare Group plc Annual Report 2017 site Stock Code ANCR OUR FINANCIALS 57 26011 Proof 4 3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued These plans qualify as a defined benefit plan as from 1 st
2016 considering the modified law.
Previously the Group has adopted a retrospective approach whereby the net liability recognised in the statement of financial position is based on the sum of the positive differences determined by individual plan participant between the minimum guaranteed reserves and the benefits accrued at the closing date based on the actual rates of return.
The impact of the defined contribution plans accounted for as a defined benefit plan is not material.
Contributions are recognized as expenses for the period in which employees perform the corresponding services.
Outstanding payments at the end of the period are shown as other current liabilities.
Employee benefits  pensions The Group operates a stakeholder pension scheme available to all eligible employees.
Payments to this scheme are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Revenue recognition Sales of goods Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods supplied stated net of discounts returns and value added taxes.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when all of the following five conditions are met The Group transfers to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods The Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold The Group can measure reliably the amount of revenue It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group and The Group can measure reliably the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction.
Trade goods include goods produced for the purpose of sale and goods purchased for resale.
The Group bases its estimate of returns on historical results taking into consideration the type of customer the type of transaction and the specifics of each arrangement.
Sales of services When the outcome of a transaction involving the rendering of services is estimated reliably revenue associated with the transaction is recognised when the services are rendered.
The outcome of a transaction is estimated reliably when all of the following four conditions are satisfied The amount of revenue is measured reliably It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group The stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date can be measured reliably and The costs incurred for the transaction and the costs to complete the transaction are measured reliably.
In general these services are invoiced as they are performed and the amounts directly recognised in the income statement and do not require the measurement of the stage of completion.
Upfront income received in relation to longterm service contracts is deferred and subsequently recognised over the life of the relevant contracts.
Interest income For all financial instruments measured at amortised cost interest income is recorded using the effective interest rate which is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period where appropriate to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability.
Interest income is included under financial income in the income statement.
Financing costs Financing costs relate to interests and other costs incurred by the Group related to the borrowing of funds.
Such costs mostly relate to interest charges on short and longterm borrowings as well as the amortisation of additional costs incurred on the issuance of the related debt.
Financing costs are recognised in profit and loss for the period or capitalised in case they are related to a qualifying asset.
Other financial income and expenses Other financial income and expenses include mainly foreign currency gains or losses on financial transactions and bankrelated expenses.
Taxes
Current income tax Income tax assets and liabilities for the current period are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED YEAR ENDED 31 S T DECEMBER 2017 58 26011 Proof 4 Current income tax relating to items that are recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is calculated using the liability method on temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
Fair value measurements Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability or in the absence of a principal market in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.

New and revised standards not yet adopted Standards and interpretations applicable for the annual period beginning on 1 st January 2017 Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows  Disclosure Initiative  effective 1 st January 2017 Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes  Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses effective 1 st January 2017 Annual Improvements Cycle 20142016  Amendments to IAS 12 effective 1 st January 2017 The application of those IFRS standards had no material effect on the 2017 consolidated financial statements of the Group.
The standards and interpretations that are issued but not yet effective up to the closing date of the Groups financial statements are disclosed below.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and subsequent amendments The final version of IFRS 9 replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement.
IFRS 9 brings together all three aspects of the accounting for financial instruments project classification and measurement impairment and hedge accounting.
IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 st January 2018.
Early application is permitted by applying all of the requirements in this standard at the same time.
Alternatively entities may elect to early apply only the requirements for the presentation of gains and losses on financial liabilities designated as FVTPL without applying the other requirements in the standard.
Except for hedge accounting retrospective application is required but providing comparative information is not compulsory.
For hedge accounting the requirements are generally applied prospectively with some limited exceptions.
Animalcare Group plc Annual Report 2017 site Stock Code ANCR OUR FINANCIALS 59 26011 Proof 4 3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued The Group plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective date.
The Group has performed an impact assessment of all three aspects of IFRS 9.
Overall the Group expects no significant impact on its balance sheet and equity of applying the impairment requirements of IFRS 9.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 specifies how and when a company will recognise revenue as well as requiring such entities to provide users of financial statements with more informative relevant disclosures.
The standard provides a single principlesbased fivestep model to be applied to all contracts with customers as follows Identify the contracts with a customer Identify the performance obligations in the contract Determine the transaction price Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and Recognise revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
Under IFRS 15 revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer.
The new revenue standard will supersede all current revenue recognition requirements under IFRS.
Either a full retrospective application or a modified retrospective application is required for annual periods beginning on or after 1 st January 2018.
Early adoption is permitted.
The Group plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective date using the full retrospective method.
During 2017 the Group performed an assessment of IFRS 15.
This analysis showed that there is no material impact on the results of the Group.
IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 sets out the principles for the recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of leases and requires lessees to account for all leases under a single onbalance sheet model similar to the accounting for finance leases under IAS 17 Leases.
The standard includes two recognition exemptions for lessees leases of lowvalue assets e. term leases i. leases with a lease term of 12 months or less.
At the commencement date of a lease a lessee will recognise a liability to make lease payments i. lease term i. the rightofuse asset.
Lessees will be required to separately recognise the interest expense on the lease liability and the depreciation expense on the rightofuse asset.
Lessees will be also required to remeasure the lease liability upon the occurrence of certain events e. used to determine those payments.
The lessee will generally recognise the amount of the remeasurement of the lease liability as an adjustment to the rightofuse asset.
Lessor accounting under IFRS 16 is substantially unchanged from todays lessor accounting under IAS 17.
Lessors will continue to classify all leases using the same classification principle as in IAS 17 and distinguish between two types of leases operating and finance leases.
IFRS 16 also requires lessees and lessors to make more extensive disclosures than under IAS 17.
The new standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 st January 2019.
Early application is permitted but not before an entity applies IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with
A lessee can choose to apply the standard using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach.
The standards transition provisions permit certain reliefs.
As at the reporting date the Group has noncancellable operating lease commitments of 3302k see note 22.
However the Group has not yet determined to what extent these commitments will result in the recognition of an asset and a liability for future payments and how this will affect the Groups profit and classification of cash flows.

Significant accounting judgements estimates and assumptions The preparation of the Groups consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue expenses assets and liabilities and the accompanying disclosures.
Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities for future periods.
On an ongoing basis the Group evaluates its estimates assumptions and judgements including those related to revenue recognition development expenses income taxes impairment of goodwill intangible assets and property plant and equipment and business combinations.
The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the consolidated financial statements were prepared.
Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments however may change due to market changes or circumstances arising beyond the control of the Group.
Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.
Internally developed intangible assets Under IAS 38 internally generated intangible assets from the development phase are recognised if certain conditions are met.
These conditions include the technical feasibility intention to complete the ability to use or sell the asset under development and the demonstration of how the asset will generate probable future economic benefits.
The cost of a recognised internally generated intangible asset comprises all directly attributable cost necessary to make the asset capable of being used as intended by management.
In contrast all expenditures arising from the research phase are expensed as incurred.
Determining whether internally generated intangible assets from development are to be recognised as intangible assets requires significant judgement particularly in determining whether the activities are considered research activities or development activities whether the product enhancement is substantial whether the completion of the asset is technically feasible considering a companyspecific approach and the probability of future economic benefits from the sale or use.
Management has determined that the conditions for recognising internally generated intangible assets from product development activities are not met until shortly before the developed products are available for sale.
This assessment is monitored by the Group on a regular basis.
Capitalised software expenditure The Group has historically capitalised software projects and developments.
Expenditure on a bespoke webbased system designed to facilitate online ordering of its products and services is currently capitalised in the Groups financial statements as the Directors have adjudged it to meet the relevant criteria.
The rate of depreciation on capitalised software is set so as to reflect the pattern of usage and the level of pace of change within the global information technology market.
Income taxes Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the losses can be utilised.
Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies.
As at 31 st December 2017 the Group had 664k 2016 255k of tax losses carried forward and other tax credits such as investment tax credits and notional interest deduction.
These losses relate to the subsidiaries that have a history of losses do not expire and may not be used to offset taxable income elsewhere in the Group.
The Group may also be required to evaluate some uncertainty surrounding potential liability in relation to uncertain tax positions.
Uncertain tax positions whether assets or liabilities are recognised using a probable threshold in accordance with IAS 12 and they are reflected at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
It may also include interpretations of complex tax laws as well as transfer pricing considerations which could be disputed by tax authorities.
Assessing uncertain tax positions requires significant judgement from management.
Animalcare Group plc Annual Report 2017 site Stock Code ANCR OUR FINANCIALS 61 26011 Proof 4 3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued Impairment of goodwill The Group has goodwill for a total amount of 51413k 2016 9959k which has been subject to an impairment test.
The goodwill is tested for impairment based on the Fair Value Less Costs of Disposal FVLCD method which uses sales and EBITDA multiples.
The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the different CGUs are disclosed and further explained in note 9.
No impairment charges have been recorded during the reported periods.
Impairment of slowmoving and obsolete inventory The Group performs regular stockholding reviews in conjunction with sales and market information to help determine any slow moving or obsolete lines.
Where identified adequate provision is made in the financial statements for writing down or writing off the value of such lines in order to reflect the realisable value of its stock.
Business combinations The Group determines and allocates the purchase price of an acquired business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the business combination date.
The purchase price allocation process requires the Group to use significant estimates and assumptions including estimated fair value of the acquired intangible assets estimated fair value of property plant and equipment While the Group is using its best estimates and assumptions as part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement.
Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets the Group has acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer contracts and relationships software licence sales and maintenance agreements the fair value of the plant and equipment the fair value of the deferred revenue discount rates and the determination of useful lives and amortisation period of acquired intangible assets.
4 Business Combinations and Disposals of
Business combinations Reverse acquisition of Animalcare Group plc On 13 th July 2017 Animalcare Group plc acquired 100% of the share capital of Ecuphar NV for a total consideration of 133775k satisfied through a combination of a shareforshare exchange and 33145k in cash net of commissions.
The acquisition of Ecuphar NV by Animalcare Group plc is deemed to be a reverse acquisition under the provisions of IFRS 3 Business
In accounting for a reverse acquisition rather than an acquisition the combined financial statements are deemed to be a continuation of the books of the legal acquiree Ecuphar NV rather than a continuation of those of the legal acquirer Animalcare Group plc.
The assets and liabilities of Ecuphar NV are recognised and measured in the Group financial statements at the pre combination carrying amounts without restatement to fair value and no goodwill arises in relation to them.
Conversely the assets of Animalcare Group plc and Animalcare Ltd are consolidated at their fair values.
The overall effect is that the consolidated financial statements are prepared from an Ecuphar NV perspective rather than Animalcare Group plc and in summary this means the comparative consolidated financial information is that of Ecuphar NV rather than that of Animalcare Group plc the result for the year and consolidated cumulative profit and loss reserves are those of the Ecuphar NV plus the post acquisition results of the Animalcare Group plc a reverse acquisition reserve of 56762k has been created the share capital and share premium account are that of Animalcare Group plc and the cost of the combination has been determined from the perspective of Ecuphar NV.
Goodwill arises on the reverse acquisition when comparing the deemed fair value consideration of Animalcare Group plc acquiring the shares of Ecuphar NV.
The fair value of the consideration is the market capitalisation of Animalcare Group plc at the acquisition date based on the closing share price on 12 th July of 355p per share.

The fair value of the consideration is the market capitalisation of Animalcare Group plc at the closing share price of 355p per share on th July 2017.
Transaction costs of equity transactions relating to the issue and readmission of the Companys shares are accounted for as a deduction from equity where they relate to the issue of new shares.
The fair value of the net assets acquired and shown in the table above was 34290k.
The fair value of the consideration was 75338k resulting in goodwill on reverse acquisition of 41048k.
In addition the fair value uplift of inventory amounted to 401k and the fair value uplift of the identified intangibles amounted to 30957k.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities respectively were increased by 885k and 6843k.

Animalcare Group plc Annual Report 2017 site Stock Code ANCR OUR FINANCIALS 71 26011 Proof 4 Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Under the Animalcare Group plc LTIP  which was introduced in June 2014 the Directors interests in the LTIP  which was implemented via a subscription for growth shares in the capital of Animalcare Ltd a subsidiary of the Company are as follows Iain Menneer  31955 A Ordinary Shares of 1.00 each A Shares for a total cash subscription of 31955 representing 5.2% of Animalcare Ltds issued share capital and Chris Brewster  19173 A Shares representing 3% of Animalcare Ltds issued share capital and 11800 B Ordinary Shares of 1.00 each B Shares representing a further 2% of Animalcare Ltds issued share capital for a total cash subscription of 30973.
The total cash subscriptions were based on independent valuation considered to be equal to fair value at the time of acquisition.
Dr Menneer and Mr Brewster had the right to sell their A Shares to the Company at any time after 27 th June 2017 in exchange for Ordinary Shares of 20 pence each in the Company Ordinary Shares.
Their rights to sell the A Shares are subject to amongst other provisions the Company having a market capitalisation in excess of 39.0m the Hurdle at the time of sale.
The Hurdle was determined by Animalcares Remuneration Committee and broadly represented a 20% premium to the Companys market capitalisation on 27 th June 2014.
Each holder of A Shares would on a sale of his entire holding to the Company be entitled to receive Ordinary Shares representing a percentage of the increase in the Companys market capitalisation above the Hurdle being 5% for Dr Menneer and 3% for Mr Brewster.
The A Shares do not have a right to receive a dividend except for any amounts distributed on the winding up of the Company or on an asset sale.
The B Shares are not entitled to participate in any increase in the value of the Company above the Hurdle but can be exchanged for Ordinary Shares of an equal value at any time after 27 th June 2017.
The B Shares have a right to an annual dividend on a nonfixed coupon basis calculated by applying a rate of LIBOR  2% to the nominal value of the B Shares.
Further details of the Plan including the Hurdle antidilution and other provisions are set out in Animalcare Ltds articles of association which is available within the Investors section constitutional documents of the Companys website at httpsite It was agreed between the Company Dr Menneer and Mr Brewster that the put options did not become exercisable as a result of the reverse acquisition of Ecuphar NV.

Basis of preparation The Company financial statements cover the period of 18 months from 1 st July 2016 to 31 st December 2017.
The financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors under the historical cost convention except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union adopted IFRSs and the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
They have also been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the AIM Rules.
Under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present a separate Profit and Loss account in these separate financial statements.
The profit dealt with in the accounts of the Company was 6028000 2016 loss 399000.
The accounting policies of the Company are the same as for the Group where applicable.
Going concern The Directors have assessed the Companys ability to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future in accordance with FRC Going Concern and Liquidity Risk guidance October 2009.
It is considered appropriate to continue to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.
Intangible assets The Company recognises intangible assets at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Intangible assets arise both as a result of applying IFRS 3 which requires the separate recognition of intangible assets from goodwill on all business combinations from 1 st January 2004 and from the purchase of software that is separable from any associated hardware.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straightline basis over their useful economic lives as follows Software Estimated useful life  4 years Operating leases Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straightline basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Employee benefits  Pensions The Company operates a stakeholder pension scheme available to all eligible employees.
Payments to this scheme are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments in Group companies are stated at cost less provisions for impairment losses.
Dividends
Dividends paid are recognised within the statement of changes in equity only when an obligation to pay the dividend arises prior to the year end.
Sharebased payments The Company issues equitysettled sharebased payments to certain employees.
Equitysettled sharebased payments are measured at fair value excluding the effect of nonmarket based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of such equitysettled sharebased payments is expensed on a straightline basis over the vesting period based on the Companys estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of nonmarket based vesting conditions with a corresponding movement in equity.
Fair value is measured by use of the BlackScholes model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted based on managements best estimate for the effects of nontransferability exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The fair value of the shares issued under the Long Term Incentive Plan were valued on a discounted cash flow basis in conjunction with a third party valuation specialist.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year .
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Companys liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
94 26011 Proof 4 1 Significant Accounting Policies continued Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the statement of comprehensive income except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Company intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Companys balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand deposits repayable on demand and other shortterm highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities.
Finance income and expense Finance income comprises interest receivable on funds invested that are recognised in the income statement.

The total cash subscriptions were based on independent valuation considered to be equal to fair value at the time of acquisition.
Dr Menneer and Mr Brewster had the right to sell their A Shares to the Company at any time after 27 th June 2017 in exchange for Ordinary Shares of 20 pence each in the Company Ordinary Shares.
Their rights to sell the A Shares are subject to amongst other provisions the Company having a market capitalisation in excess of 39.0m the Hurdle at the time of sale.
The Hurdle was determined by Animalcares Remuneration Committee and broadly represented a 20% premium to the Companys market capitalisation on 27 th June 2014.
Each holder of A Shares would on a sale of his entire holding to the Company be entitled to receive Ordinary Shares representing a percentage of the increase in the Companys market capitalisation above the Hurdle being 5% for Dr Menneer and 3% for Mr Brewster.
The A Shares do not have a right to receive a dividend except for any amounts distributed on the winding up of the Company or on an asset sale.
The B Shares are not entitled to participate in any increase in the value of the Company above the Hurdle but can be exchanged for Ordinary Shares of an equal value at any time after 27 th June 2017.
The B Shares have a right to an annual dividend on a nonfixed coupon basis calculated by applying a rate of LIBOR  2% to the nominal value of the B Shares.
Further details of the Plan including the Hurdle antidilution and other provisions are set out in Animalcare Ltds articles of association which is available within the Investors section constitutional documents of the Companys website at httpsite It was agreed between the Company Dr Menneer and Mr Brewster that the put options did not become exercisable as a result of the reverse acquisition of Ecuphar NV.
The Company however determined that it was appropriate to offer the right to exchange their shares in Animalcare Limited for Ordinary Shares shortly before completion of the reverse acquisition and each took up that right.
As a consequence 918896 new Ordinary Shares were issued to Dr Menneer and Mr Brewster.
The number of new Ordinary Shares issued pursuant to the exercise of these rights was determined using the lower of the closing middle market price for an Ordinary Share on 22 June 2017 being the dealing day before the date the offer to exchange was made and the average of the closing middle market prices for an Ordinary Share over the dealing days in the 30 day period before that date being 392.5 pence.

This was satisfied by the issue of 918896 new Ordinary Shares at a price of 392.5 pence per share.
On 19 th July 2017 Animalcare Ltd was transferred to Ecuphar NV as part of a postcompletion restructuring of the Group.
The consideration was 4000000 in cash.
