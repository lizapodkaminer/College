CHAIRMANS STATEMENT
TEN YEARS OF CREATING VALUE THROUGH GROWTH AND RETURNS Although the Group has a history stretching back over a century Fresnillo only became a listed company in 2008.
Today as we stand on the brink of our second decade we can look back on our achievements with justifiable pride.
Despite a changing market environment and pressures affecting the mining industry as a whole we are delivering on our longterm commitments and continuing to create value through growth and returns for our stakeholders.
Over the last decade we have paid close to US2.5 billion in dividends invested over US4 billion to sustain and expand our operations and develop new projects and increased attributable silver and gold production by over 55% and 245% respectively.
FOR MORE DETAILS ON OUR ACHIEVEMENTS  IN BOTH FINANCIAL AND NONFINANCIAL TERMS  SINCE THE IPO IN 2008 SEE PAGES 12 26 52 72 While we remain confident about our future and growth potential we do not ignore the challenges faced by the mining industry.
These include lower grades access to land environmental demands social pressures and growing complexities in the permitting processes among others.
Managing these pressures requires increased focus and expertise to avoid excessive delays to projects and to maintain our social licence to operate.
KEY POINTS Adjusted revenue 9.2% Increased profitability gross profit 4.9% profit for the period 32.0% Dividends paid in 2017 of US236.6 million up 168.2% Strong corporate governance Increased gender diversity at Board level Further growth and returns anticipated 2017 A YEAR OF PROGRESS 2017 has again proved the importance of a consistent conservative longterm strategy based primarily on organic growth developed and implemented by a committed professional team and fully supported by the Board.
This provided the foundation for another year of record silver production and stable gold production.
The commitment to exploration across precious metals price cycles continues to be the key to our success growth and longterm prospects.
WE END OUR FIRST DECADE OF OPERATIONS AS WE STARTED IT FIRM IN OUR COMMITMENT TO GROWTH AND RETURNS ENERGISED BY THE SUCCESS OF OUR STRATEGY AND CONFIDENT ABOUT OUR FUTURE PROSPECTS.

Against a backdrop of relatively stable precious metals prices and an upward trend of byproduct base metal prices we have delivered sound financial results.
The Group generated over US2230 million in adjusted revenue in 2017 a rise of 9.2% over the prior year with a 32.0% increase in profit for the period.
Cash and other liquid funds at year end were US896.0 million versus US912.0 in 2016 and debt remained at US800 million.
FOR OUR MARKETS SEE PAGES 1417
FOR THE FINANCIAL REVIEW
SEE PAGES 104115 CONSISTENT DIVIDEND POLICY Fresnillo plcs dividend policy is closely aligned with our focus on creating value through growth and returns and is based on paying out 3350% of profit after tax each year with certain adjustments made to exclude noncash effects in the income statement.
Dividends are paid in the approximate proportions of onethird as an interim dividend with the balance as a final dividend.
Before declaring a dividend the Board carries out detailed analysis of the profitability of the business underlying earnings capital requirements and cash flows.
Our aim is to maintain sufficient flexibility to respond to movements in precious metals prices and other factors that could impact our business.
We declared an interim dividend of 10.6 US cents per share with a final dividend of 29.8 US cents per share bringing the total for the year to US297.7 million.
MEETING OUR OPERATIONAL GOALS At the time of the IPO we set ourselves two demanding targets for our first decade of operations.
Our target for gold production of 750 koz was reached in 2015 three years ahead of plan while the 65 moz objective for silver is on track to be achieved in 2018.
There were a number of key operational developments during the year but here I would like to focus on two in particular .
Firstly the second phase of our silvergold San Julin project was commissioned.
This new mine discovered by our exploration team is a cornerstone of our future prospects and opens a promising remote district to further growth.
Several Board members visited the site during 2017 and saw at firsthand how the plans of the Board and management have become reality.
Secondly despite falling short of our expectations due to several operational issues performance at the Fresnillo mine continued to improve.
We have taken a number of corrective steps to address these issues including strengthening our operational leadership team improving contractor efficiency and eliminating bottlenecks caused by inefficient working practices.
We expect the construction of the new Pyrites plant to significantly advance towards commissioning in 2018 improving the gold and silver recovery from the tailings at both the Fresnillo and Saucito mines.
In addition we started construction of the second line at the Dynamic Leaching Plant at Herradura which will improve gold recovery particularly as we encounter increasing quantities of higher sulphide grade ore.
The Board expects to approve the development of our joint venture with Mag Silver at Juanicipio in the first half of 2018 and we anticipate the startup of production in the first half of 2020.
Juanicipio is the next major project for Fresnillo and management is committed to ensuring that the mine fulfils its true potential.
We have a wellestablished record of replenishing reserves and resources and 2017 again saw good progress in this respect.
Exploration results for the year were positive.
Overall our resource base has expanded significantly.
Silver resources have grown from 2171 moz in 2016 to 2320 moz in 2017 while gold resources remained stable at 38.5 moz.
Gold reserves increased by 22.7% mainly due to the Herradura mine while silver reserves showed a decrease of 5.4% with an increase at Saucito offset by falls at Fresnillo and Cinega.
Exploration remains a key pillar of our Company as we move towards achieving our 2018 goals and further success in the years beyond.
OUR WORKFORCE Health and safety remain the paramount priority of our Board.
I regret to report that one fatal accident occurred in early 2017.
While the trend of the broader safety indicators continued to improve supported by our drive towards a more systematic approach to incidents this fatality is unacceptable.
One fatality is one too many and our sincere condolences and support have been conveyed to the family of the victim.
We will never sacrifice the health and safety of our people  or the longterm sustainability of our business  for shortterm gain financial or otherwise and strive to implement bestinclass systems and practices throughout the
However it is clear that there remains much work to do particularly where contractors are concerned.
Contractor staff do not always display a consistent focus on safety and lack sufficient training due to frequent rotation of personnel.
During the year we took decisive steps to engage them in our health and safety culture.
This new approach has already borne fruit and will be extended in 2018.

CHAIRMANS STATEMENT
CONTINUED
The Boards Health Safety Environment and Community Relations HSECR Committee continued to review our culture and values as part of its work and will be monitoring progress in the coming year .
We again increased our HSECR activities during 2017 supporting a large number of new and established programmes which underline our commitment to the wellbeing of our people and their communities.
Please see the Social and Sustainability Report on pages 74103 for more details.
SUPPORTING OUR EXECUTIVE TEAM The Board plays an active role in setting Group strategy and supporting the Executive Committee.
We regularly review progress versus plan ensuring that the business has the required flexibility to respond to changing market conditions while at the same time fulfilling our commitment to continuous investment across price cycles.
During 2017 we again ensured that capital allocation was balanced by growth shareholder returns financial strength and flexibility within the context of our commitment to sustainability and risk management.
Familiarity with the business is key for an effective Board.
I encourage Board members to gain practical knowledge about our activities and over the course of the year my colleagues visited a number of operational sites.
For example six Directors visited San Julin to gain firsthand understanding of the importance and challenges of the operation.
STRENGTHENING OUR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE The most important function of the Board is to ensure strong and effective corporate governance.
We have continued to identify and where appropriate implement best practice in line with the UK Corporate Governance Code and evolving stakeholder expectations in both the UK and Mexico.
I have set out details regarding the major developments in my introduction to the Corporate Governance section on page 117.
In summary these include New antibribery and corruption legislation in Mexico.
The work we have undertaken over the past few years to ensure compliance with UK legislation enabled us to accommodate the requirements of the new Mexican legislation with ease.
Continued support for greater gender diversity at Board level in line with our commitment to align Fresnillo more closely with expectations relating to diversity on FTSE 100 boards.
Evolution of the independent representation on the Board.
The continued support of over 99% of our independent shareholders for our executive remuneration policy.
As we approach the tenth anniversary of our listing on the London Stock Exchange I am pleased to report that while our business model has remained essentially the same we are also continuing to learn and evolve  particularly in the areas of sustainability the application of IT and corporate governance.
For example our Code of Conduct was reviewed and benefited from updates during the year reflecting our commitment to building and maintaining an ethical culture across all our operations.
Based on our values of Responsibility Integrity Trust and Loyalty this culture is the cornerstone of our past achievements and the platform for our future success.
2017 again saw us complement regular workshops and master classes with online training in order to ensure that all our people are aware of the importance we attach to our values.
Corporate culture is a key agenda item for every Board meeting with updates on the cultural programme provided as part of the CEOs report.
These regular bulletins are supported by an annual presentation by the Head of Sustainability.
CHANGES TO THE BOARD In May I was delighted to welcome Dame Judith Macgregor as an Independent Nonexecutive Director .
Dame Judith was the British Ambassador to Mexico from 2009 to 2013 and has been the President of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office FCO Womens Association since 2006 overseeing a significant increase in the number of FCO women in senior grades.
Dame Judith is the third female appointment to the Board in the past five years and is currently one of two female members.
With women continuing to be underrepresented on our Board and in our workforce during the year we developed a new policy which aims to encapsulate our commitment to greater diversity and inclusion.
OUTLOOK FOR 2018 AND BEYOND We will continue to maintain our disciplined approach to investment in order to support the key Explore Develop Operate and Sustain elements of the business model.
Our
Fresnillo increased production at San Julin development of Juanicipio and the continued evaluation of the Orisyvo gold project.
Human Capital is key to our ability to create value through growth and returns.
Throughout 2017 our people again showed the skills and professionalism needed to overcome challenges as well as the commitment to deliver results.
On behalf of the Board and shareholders I want to express my gratitude for their efforts.
The Board and I reiterate our confidence in the established and proven strategy and in the capacity of the Executive Committee to execute it.
While volatility in exchange rates or precious metals prices may present shortterm challenges we anticipate further growth and returns over the longer term.

OCTAVIO ALVDREZ
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
CEO QandA OVERLEAF 08 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Once again we have managed our costs expanded our exploration pipeline and achieved our production guidelines all of which have combined to enable us to continue our track record of creating value through growth and returns.
At the time of our IPO in 2008 we made a commitment to double production by 2018.
After nine years  a period that has seen a global financial crisis as well as volatile prices for precious metals  we are well on the way to confirming this remarkable achievement.
Our success bears testament to the expertise commitment and sheer hard work of our people without whom none of this would have been possible.
But it is also a tribute to the original vision of the Board and the strength of a strategy that is both effective and consistent.
When times are challenging it can be tempting to switch strategy to address shortterm trends for example by making substantial cutbacks to areas such as exploration.
Indeed this is something that we have seen many of our peers do over the last decade.
At Fresnillo however our strategy has remained constant from our first day of operation  and this consistency has been the platform for what has been a successful record of growth and returns.
Q  WHAT WERE THE PRODUCTION HEADLINES FOR THE YEAR A  Silver production from our mines reached a record level of 54.2 moz due to phase I at San Julin operating at full capacity for the entire year and the start of operations of phase II at the same mine.
Production at the Fresnillo mine also increased yearonyear albeit at a slower pace than anticipated.
We are continuing to implement several improvement measures at the mine including enhanced equipment maintenance the installation of a vertical conveyor to reduce truck haulage and increased supervision to improve the efficiency of our contractors.
These measures together with the hiring of two new contractors will help us maintain development rates at the Fresnillo mine and improve them in the long run.
As expected gold production slightly decreased due to the reduction in inventories at Herradura in 2016 not being repeated to the same extent in 2017 and a slower speed of recovery at Noche Buena due to a longer leaching process.
Zinc production increased as a result of the positive contribution from San Julin and increased volumes produced at the Fresnillo mine due to the higher ore grades.
Q  HOW DID PRECIOUS METALS PRICES IMPACT PERFORMANCE DURING THE YEAR A  Fresnillos operations are designed to deliver results across price cycles.
They did so during the years when prices were falling  and they have done so again over the last 12 months when prices for silver and gold have been largely stable.
At the same time the year saw a significant increase in prices for base metals which are byproducts of our silver and gold production processes and this upward trend made a positive contribution towards our overall financial performance.
Our proven ability to perform in all price environments is important given the unpredictable nature of prices.
This ability is based on an effective strategy teamed with high quality execution.
Operational excellence targeted investment and disciplined cash management as well as sustainable business practices are the hallmarks of our decadelong reputation for achievement.
Q  LOOKING AT THE STRATEGY IN DETAIL HOW DID YOU MAXIMISE THE POTENTIAL OF EXISTING OPERATIONS IN 2017 A  Maximising the potential of existing operations is the first pillar of our strategy and we recorded a number of key achievements during the year .
Firstly we continued the turnaround at our flagship Fresnillo mine which has a history that can be traced back to the 16th century.
While the mine remains very productive it is nonetheless a mature operation  and there is an inevitable downward trend in grade as the workable veins narrow and weaken.
Put simply we have to invest in infrastructure in order to maintain high rates of production as we go deeper and incur the increased costs associated with greater haulage distances.
QandA WITH THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE CONSISTENT STRATEGY CONSISTENT PERFORMANCE KEY POINTS On track to deliver commitments made at time of IPO New objectives due to be announced in summer 2018 Silver production up 16.6% gold production down 2.6% Improved performance at Fresnillo Phase II at San Julin commissioned as planned Silver resources up by 6.9% gold resources remained stable Silver reserves down by 5.4% gold reserves up by 22.7% Improvement in health and safety A challenging year ahead but we face the future with confidence I AM DELIGHTED TO REPORT THAT 2017 WAS ANOTHER GOOD YEAR FOR FRESNILLO.

I am pleased to say that despite issues with maintenance and contractors performance at Fresnillo has improved yearonyear with an upturn in production from 15.9 moz in 2016 to 16.5 moz in 2017.
At Saucito the relatively small investments made in previous years have consolidated the mines position as the worlds largest silver producing mine allowing throughput to increase by a third albeit reducing recoveries in the short term.
We also maximised the efficiency of the Dynamic Leaching Plant at San Julin where the drive and skills of our people have seen us consistently achieve 3500 and at times over 3800 tonnes per day from a process that has a nominal design capacity of 3000 tonnes per day.
In last years report I referred to a comprehensive review of how IT can be the springboard for improved efficiency.
This initiative made significant progress in 2017 with several projects now in place and delivering results.
Among others these include Ventilation Plus which is now providing ventilation on demand at San Julin and is being deployed at Saucito Fresnillo and Cinega Track Plus which enables our teams to know the precise locations of every resource across a mine and is in operation at San Julin and Saucito and ProxAlarm which improves safety by preventing collisions and other incidents involving vehicles and is in the process of being installed at all mines.
FOR OUR OPERATIONAL KPIS SEE PAGES 2829 Q  HOW HAVE YOU DELIVERED GROWTH THROUGH DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS A  The construction of the San Julin silver and gold mine has been a hugely important project for Fresnillo.
We identified the need for this project at the time of the IPO and it finally came to fruition in 2017 with the completion of phase II.
The flotation plant was commissioned in July and we expect the mine to achieve an average annual production of 14.2 moz of silver and 49.3 koz of gold.
Located on the ChihuahuaDurango border we believe that San Julin has the potential to become established as an entirely new mining district.
In addition construction of the Pyrites plant has continued as planned.
This development project will strengthen the Companys production profile by extracting additional quantities of silver and gold from the historical and ongoing tailings at the Fresnillo and Saucito mines.
Construction of the second line at the Dynamic Leaching Plant at Herradura also continued during the year with commissioning expected in the first half of 2018.
This plant will enable sulphides occurring deeper in the pit to be processed more efficiently.
FOR OUR DEVELOPMENT KPIS SEE PAGE 30 Q  HOW HAVE YOU EXTENDED THE GROWTH
A  Our ability to fuel the pipeline has been one of our most notable success stories over the years.
While some of our peers have neglected their exploration activities our strategy has been to actively expand ours  and the talented team of over 100 Fresnillo geologists has enabled us to make great strides in our resources.
From just over 1 boz of silver in 2008 our resources had more than doubled to 2.3 boz by the end of 2017 supported by around 1.8 m hectares of exploration mining concessions in
At the same time our gold resources have increased from 12 moz in 2008 to 38.5 moz at the end of 2017.
We have made good progress in Peru where 350000 hectares of concessions have given Fresnillo the largest exploration portfolio in the country.
We have identified significant opportunities at Pilarica and expect this to become our first operational mine outside Mexico in the medium term.
We are also set to begin exploration in Chile following three years of scouting the territory and have begun a project to evaluate opportunities in Argentina which shares some of Chiles geological potential.
FOR OUR EXPLORATION KPIS SEE PAGE 30 Q  AND HOW HAVE YOU ADVANCED AND ENHANCED THE SUSTAINABILITY OF YOUR OPERATIONS A  The last of our four strategic pillars sustainability lies at the heart of everything we do at Fresnillo and nothing is more important to the sustainability of our Company than the health and safety of our employees and contractors.
Although the trend from 2011 to 2017 is in the right direction we can never be complacent and sadly we have to report that we experienced one fatality at the beginning of the year .
We continued to strengthen our health and safety programmes in 2017 focusing on engaging contractors as well as our own people.
Around 70% of our workforce of 16000 are contractors and we are working hard to align them fully with our health and safety culture and expectations.
A new approach piloted at Saucito and subsequently adopted at both Fresnillo and Cinega is already strengthening our safety culture.
Under this new approach which we plan to roll out across our other operations in the coming months our people are encouraged to report each incident within a fixed time frame no matter how minor and with a full description.
Our safety team then analyses the incident and identifies its root cause enabling us to more systematically put measures in place to prevent any reoccurrence.
FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 QandA WITH THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE
Our promise to create value through growth and returns is not confined to our financial investors and we were pleased to be included in the FTSE4 Good Index in 2017.
We work hard to ensure that the communities close to our operations also see a return on their investment of time skills and commitments.
Initiatives such as the Week of Health Silver Saves Lives and a wide range of educational programmes have proved very successful in improving the lives and prospects of those who depend on us or are impacted by our operations.
FOR OUR SUSTAINABILITY KPIS SEE PAGE 31 Q  THE GOALS SET AT THE TIME OF THE IPO ARE ALMOST ALL NOW ACHIEVED HAVE YOU SET A NEW TARGET A  It is cause of great satisfaction to the management team that we are on track to achieve our original production goals by the end of the next financial year .
We are currently in the process of finalising our next set of objectives and these will be announced as part of our interim results presentation in August 2018.
Q  WILL THE STRATEGY CHANGE IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE YOUR FUTURE GOALS A  No absolutely not.
A proven strategy applied with consistency has been the foundation for our success to date and a key differentiating factor between ourselves and our peers.
Despite our relative youth as a standalone Company our history as a mining group stretches back 130 years and we drew on all the experience gathered across those decades to identify and establish the principles that shaped our strategy.
The business model is sound the balance sheet robust and the ability to deliver results across all price cycles has been ably demonstrated.
As we move into our second decade we will continue to monitor opportunities to complement organic growth with accretive mergers and acquisitions.
However we recognise that this can be a challenge.
Most operations we evaluate from geological and financial perspectives fall short of the rigorous criteria and expectations we apply to Fresnillo operations.
Q  WHAT DO YOU EXPECT IN 2018 A  While we are forecasting that all our operations will perform at their maximum levels we nonetheless anticipate a challenging year in 2018.
Inflationary pressures are likely to increase and it is unclear whether precious metals prices have already bottomed out or may drift lower .
In addition 2018 is an election year in Mexico and this will doubtless bring an unwelcome degree of volatility to exchange rates.
However that said our people have worked successfully in similar market environments before and will undoubtedly do so again.
We expect continued growth through exploration and development together with increased production at San Julin further improvements in performance at Fresnillo completion of the new Dynamic Leaching Plant at Herradura and the commissioning of the new Pyrites plant at Saucito.
These projects will lead to increased production with associated costs though we will continue to seek corresponding efficiencies from other operations.
A strong balance sheet targeted investment and operating costs amongst the lowest in the industry will again be the defining characteristics of our Company.
In particular I look forward to our project at Juanicipio moving from exploration to the development stage subject to Board approval in April 2018.
Our new approach to health and safety is set to be rolled out to all mines and this should lead to an improved system that will benefit all employees and contractors.
In conclusion I would like to thank our people communities suppliers clients and shareholders for their continued support during the last year .
Together we face the future with cautious confidence.

FRESNILLO IN CONTEXT We are also affected by factors common to the mining industry in general as well as by those more specific to the business environment in Mexico.
In silver our peers are other primary silver miners although much of the global silver production is derived as a byproduct of gold lead zinc and copper mines.
We have long been the top global producer of silver both byproduct and primary and aim to maintain that leadership position.
We are also one of Mexicos largest gold producers with peers being other mediumsize producers.
THE PRECIOUS METALS MARKET Silver prices traded in the range of US15.62oz to US18.54oz during 2017 ending the year up 6.3% versus the previous year which suggests a fairly balanced market.
Prices were driven in part by investors seeking a safe haven in the face of global uncertainties.
Gold ended 2017 13.5% higher versus 2016 supported by a weakening US dollar continued geopolitical instability and increased equity valuations which saw investors adding gold to their portfolios in order to manage risk exposure.
The price of gold fluctuated between US1158oz and US1349oz over the 12 months.
Fresnillo plc does not take a position on where prices demand or sentiment are headed however we do monitor price movements and market dynamics in order to support our financial projections and cash management strategies and prices will continue to colour budget considerations in areas such as exploration and the timing of certain capital expenditures.

SUPPLY AND DEMAND
The price of silver has been supported by a yearonyear decline in production since the 2015 peak with the latest reports estimating that annual production for 2017 will fall to 870 moz a reduction of 2% To a significant extent this continuing downward trend is a result of the industrys ongoing under investment in capex as miners attempt to protect margins.
Most analysts expect global production to again fall in the coming years.
However silver production as a byproduct of base metal mining is likely to grow as producers increase activity in response to recent hikes in the prices of lead and zinc up 22.4% and 30.5% respectively for the 12 months ending 31 December 2017.
Given the time and resources required to bring a new mine on stream our expectations are that any negative impact of such additional supply will be felt in the medium rather than the short term.
As the chart shows demand for silver is predominantly generated by industry and also by investors who prize it as a safe haven.
The exceptionally high electrical and thermal conductivity of silver make it ideal for use in the electrical and electronic industries in particular the solar energy sector .
SILVER DEMAND BY SECTOR
Jewellery 20% 207.0 Coins and Bars 20% 206.8 Silverware 5% 52.1 Industrial Fabrication 55% 561.9 Looking ahead we see both positive and negative factors influencing demand.
Global economic growth and innovation will increase demand for technologies associated with solar energy mobile telephony the internet of things and autonomous vehicles among other sectors.
This will in turn drive demand for silver .
On the other hand this increase in demand will to an extent be offset by the practice of thrifting as manufacturers seek to control their costs by reducing silver content in their products.
GOLD
Global gold production continues to grow with 3268 tonnes being produced in 2017 according to the World Gold Council.
Demand for gold is primarily due to its value as a hedge against inflation.
It has long been regarded as a reliable safe haven asset and a highly regarded store of wealth.
In addition gold is sought after by societies across the world for its appearance and has been fashioned into jewellery and works of art for centuries.
Gold also plays a role in industry where properties such as conductivity mean it is the metal of choice for a huge range of highend electronic products.
The outlook for gold is heavily influenced by developments in the US.
Potential headwinds for gold prices include a stronger US dollar and the new US tax reform.
In addition with the dollar ceasing to fall the Federal Reserve has confirmed its intentions to further tighten monetary policy.

FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 OUR MARKETS
CAPITAL INVESTMENT AND BALANCE SHEET STRENGTH From 2012 into 2016 weakening commodity prices introduced a sense of urgency among heavily leveraged mining companies to strengthen their balance sheets.
Today and in the near term the focus for many is on sustaining current production levels rather than investing for growth.
As existing mines move towards the end of their lives miners will increasingly rely on lower grade deposits or those with more complex metallurgy.
The search for new deposits is timeconsuming and demands significant capital at a time when access to such funds is constrained and many miners appear unwilling to invest.
Only when balance sheets have been strengthened are miners likely to look to increase production and releverage.
THE OPPORTUNITY FOR FRESNILLO Our strategy has always been to invest across all price cycles while maintaining a strong balance sheet.
This dual focus is a key differentiator for Fresnillo  it has enabled us to build a solid business that provides consistently high returns for investors and at the same time increase our mineral resources and production profiles.
So while some of our peers look to stand still we are continuing to create a platform and a pipeline for sustained growth.
TECHNOLOGY IMPLEMENTATION Cost inflation continues to be a major factor for our industry  particularly in Mexico which has recorded average inflation of over 5% per year for the last two years  and miners are seeking to establish themselves at the lower end of the cost curve in a bid to gain competitive advantage.
Technology has a major role to play not only in improving health safety and working conditions but also in boosting productivity.
THE OPPORTUNITY FOR FRESNILLO Our continued investment in digital technology  including the optimisation of processes  is a significant factor in our drive to reduce costs while improving performance.
We provide greater detail on technology initiatives launched or developed during 2017 on pages 5051.
SUSTAINABILITY AND LICENCE TO OPERATE Miners must navigate complex issues and regulations in order to maintain a licence to operate and grow sustainable businesses.
Environmental and social factors are increasingly important issues with resource nationalism in many jurisdictions affecting regulation and taxation.
In addition pressure from nongovernmental organisations NGOs and communities both organised and ad hoc can lead to work stoppages project closures and increased pressure for more tangible community benefits and shared value creation mechanisms.
THE OPPORTUNITY FOR FRESNILLO We strive to ensure that the communities close to our operations benefit from the success of our business.
Initiatives such as the Week of Health Silver Saves Lives a wide range of educational programmes and shared activities have proved very successful in improving the lives and prospects of those who depend on us or are impacted by our operations.

GOLD DEMAND BY SECTOR
Jewellery 52% 2135.5 Investment 30% 1231.9 Central banks and other institutions 10% 371.4 Technology 8% 332.8 On the upside increased global economic prosperity is likely to breathe some life back into the depressed jewellery market while continued geopolitical uncertainties continue to have an impact on demand.
KEY INDUSTRY TRENDS Several trends affect the mining industry and therefore our performance and prospects.
As many of these trends are aligned with our key risks we include detailed analysis of their implications as well as our response and mitigating actions on pages 3447.

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IN MEXICO Mexico has the second largest economy in Latin America and is characterised by a mature and relatively stable tax and legal framework.
The countrys resources are significant and diverse offering opportunities for many types of companies.
In addition energy reforms are increasing foreign direct investment and supporting the drive towards cleaner cheaper and more sustainable sources of energy.
The country has a mining history extending almost 500 years.
It is the largest producer of silver in the world and a top global producer of gold copper and zinc amongst other minerals.
All our current operations are located in Mexico where the mining sector accounts for 4% of GDP.
We take a broadly positive view of the longterm opportunities in Mexico.
That said with the presidential election scheduled for 2018 and NAFTA negotiations ongoing we expect market volatility in the short term to continue.

THIS FRAMEWORK ENABLES US TO IDENTIFY ASSESS PRIORITISE AND MANAGE RISKS IN ORDER TO DELIVER THE VALUE CREATION OBJECTIVES DEFINED IN OUR BUSINESS MODEL.
RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
Our risk management system is based on risk identification assessment prioritisation mitigation and monitoring processes which are continually evaluated improved and enhanced in line with best practice.
In addition to our established risk management activities our executives operations managers the controllership group HSECR managers and exploration managers regularly engage in strengthening the effectiveness of our current controls.
This supports the Board in its responsibilities of monitoring and reviewing risk management and the internal control systems.
2017 RISK ASSESSMENT As part of our 2017 risk assessment exercise a team of 142 people worked together to evaluate 108 risks across all our operations advanced projects exploration offices and support and corporate areas.
We identified and subsequently added a new risk during the year which reflected the specific circumstances related to the Increase in the frequency of the reviews by the tax authorities with special focus on the mining industry.
We narrowed down our 108 risks into major risks which are monitored by executive management and the Audit Committee.
We then further consolidated these into 12 principal risks which are closely monitored by the Board of Directors.
This new risk is grouped within the Potential actions by the government principal risk.

FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 MANAGING OUR RISKS
RISK APPETITE
Risk rating relative position 2017 Very high 1 2016 Very high 1 LINK TO STRATEGY CHANGE IN HEAT MAP DESCRIPTION OF RISK LEVEL According to the majority of silver and gold price analysts the expected volatility of metal prices is lower than in recent times.
Mediumterm projections indicate stronger prices due to unpredictable global political and economic issues including the US administrations ability to drive through changes to fiscal policy very low or negative real rates and improvement in the Eurozones economic position due to recent centrist political successes.
KEY RISK INDICATORS Gross profit sensitivity to percentage change in precious metals price and to the Mexican pesoUS dollar exchange rate.
EBITDA sensitivity to percentage change in metals price and to Mexican pesoUS dollar exchange rate.
IMPACT OF METAL PRICES AND GLOBAL MACROECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS RISK DESCRIPTION Certain events could create an adverse impact on our sales and profits and potentially the economic viability of projects.
These events include A decrease in precious metal prices which is the primary driver for this risk.
For the second consecutive year gold achieved a higher annual average realised price over the previous year 1.7% versus 2016.
Silver prices experienced a slight decrease of 1.7%.
Revaluation of the Mexican peso.
In 2017 the peso was revalued by 4.5% versus the average spot exchange rate of US dollars.
General inflation in Mexico.
This was 6.7% in Mexican pesos in 2017.
The specific inflation affecting the Company was 6.4% in US dollar terms.
A decrease in the price of our byproducts which is a relatively minor risk.
In 2017 prices rose for the second consecutive year with the average annual prices for lead and zinc rising 24.9% and 34.9% respectively over the previous year .
RESPONSEMITIGATION
Our hedging policy remains guided by the principle of providing shareholders with full exposure to gold and silver prices.
However following shareholder approval for the acquisition of 44% of Penmont and associated companies in 2014 we initiated a specific hedging programme to protect the value of the investment made in the acquisition using a collar structure to allow partial continued exposure to gold prices.
The volume associated with this phased hedging programme was strictly limited to up to 44% of production associated with the acquired Penmont assets and will not be extended to other assets in the Group.
The total volume hedged was 1559689 oz of which 324780 oz expired in 2017 with no corresponding cash impact.
The only impact on the income statement was a loss of US41 million related to the time value associated with gold commodity options.
FOR THE FINANCIAL REVIEW
SEE PAGES 104115 We are not precluded from entering into derivatives to minimise our exposure to changes in the prices of lead and zinc byproducts.
The Group entered into a collar hedging structure in 2017 with maturities starting in 2018 so no results were recorded in the income statement.
This structure aims to mitigate the risk related to the sale of lead and zinc.
See note 31 in the financial statements page 239.
Furthermore we have hedging policies in place for foreign exchange risk including those associated with capex related to projects.
In 2017 we entered into a number of foreign exchange forward contracts denominated in euros Swedish krona and Canadian dollars.
See note 31 in the financial statements page 238.
We suffered significant increases in our main energy inputs over the previous year with the average cost of diesel USClt. average USC increasing by 28.8%.
This was due to the increase in international petroleum prices and the market liberalisation of fuel prices in Mexico.
We will continue to identify and maintain efficiency initiatives to reduce our energy consumption.

RISK APPETITE
Risk rating relative position 2017 Very high 2 2016 Very high 2 LINK TO STRATEGY CHANGE IN HEAT MAP DESCRIPTION OF RISK LEVEL The mining industry continues to face legal challenges in regard to access to land by individuals and local communities who may seek to disregard previous land agreements.
This has been a consistent challenge in recent years.
In addition in areas close to land of interest prior and informed consultation and consent of indigenous communities may be required on a casebycase basis.
The outcome is that despite our many strategic actions the perceived level of this risk remains very high.
KEY RISK INDICATORS Percentage of land required for advanced exploration projects which is under occupation or other agreements other than full property ownership overall and by project.
Total US dollar and percentage of project budget spend on HSECR activities including community relations at projects and exploration sites.
ACCESS TO LAND RISK DESCRIPTION Failure or significant delays in accessing the surface land above our mineral concessions and other land of interest is a persistent risk to our strategy and has a potentially high impact on our objectives.
Possible barriers to land access include Rising expectations of land owners.
Refusal to acknowledge prior land acquisition terms and conditions by members of an agrarian community.
Influence of multiple special interests in land negotiations.
Conflicts in land boundaries with an often arduous resolution process.
Succession issues among land owners resulting in a lack of clarity about the legal entitlement to possess and sell land.
Litigation risk i. communities andor judicial authorities.
Presence of indigenous communities in the proximity of land that is of interest where prior and informed consultation and consent of such communities may be required.
Furthermore insecurity and conflicts in our exploration and operational areas increase the complexity of land access.
RESPONSEMITIGATION
We actively manage our mining rights in order to maximise our opportunities for successful land access focusing on areas of interest or strategic value.
At the end of 2017 after adding required areas and divesting areas of less interest we held 1.8 million hectares the same area as the previous year .
Other initiatives include Careful advanced planning for land requirements and acquisitions e. land purchase before intensive exploration.
In certain areas of interest we negotiate leasing or occupation agreements with purchase options in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.
The fostering of strong community relations through investment in community programmes and infrastructure.
Such investments totalled US2.4 million in 2017.
Always seeking triparty cooperation between the government community and ourselves in securing access to land.
Early involvement of our community relations teams during the negotiation and acquisition processes including the exploration stage.
Working with our land negotiation teams which comprise specialists hired directly by Fresnillo and also provided by Peoles as part of the service agreement.
As part of an ongoing review of the legal status of our land rights we identified certain areas of opportunity and continue to implement measures to manage this risk on a casebycase basis.
Such measures include whenever possible negotiating with agrarian communities for the outright purchase of land.
We use mechanisms provided under agrarian law and also utilise other legal mechanisms under mining law which afford added protection for land occupation.
We have already closed several such agreements in the states of Sonora and Zacatecas.
These activities form part of our ongoing drive to reduce exposure to risk regarding surface rights.
FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 MANAGING OUR RISKS
RISK APPETITE
Risk rating relative position 2017 Very high 3 2016 Very high 3 LINK TO STRATEGY CHANGE IN HEAT MAP DESCRIPTION OF RISK LEVEL We continue to perceive this risk level as very high due to the pressure that the government or government officials in either case both at the federal and local levels could exert over the mining industry.
Evidence of this influence on our industry can be seen in the increase in the frequency of reviews by the tax authorities the new legislation requiring management to ensure that contractors are compliant with their own tax obligations and the imposition of the environmental taxes contained in the new Tax Law in Zacatecas.
In addition it is evident in the continued perceived level of corruption across Mexico which remains high and worsened versus the previous year .
We share a general industry view that regrettably local and regional governments in particular have worsened in this regard notwithstanding the national effort to implement an anticorruption system which is not yet fully deployed.
As a result delays in obtaining permits for certain operations andor projects remain a risk.
President senate and representative chambers elections together with other local positions will be held in 2018.
As a result an increase in the level of this risk is likely depending on the candidates stance towards mining.
KEY RISK INDICATORS Number of media mentions related to mining regulations.
These could include mentions of tax royalties the banning of mining activities in protected areas and legal precedents.
The indicator also provides detail on the media itself such as speaker profile and political alignment.
POTENTIAL ACTIONS BY THE GOVERNMENT
IMPLEMENTATION OF MORE STRINGENT REGULATIONS FOR OBTAINING PERMITS ETC.
RISK DESCRIPTION Government actions may have an adverse impact on us.
These could include stringent regulations relating to the environment or explosives or more challenging processes for obtaining permits or more onerous tax compliance obligations as well as more frequent reviews by tax authorities refer to financial statement notes for more detail pages 192243.
On 1 January 2017 a new tax law the Tax Law came into effect in the state of Zacatecas in northern Mexico.
It includes a new set of environmental taxes relating to the following activities undertaken within the state i.
Extraction of materials other than minerals referenced in Article 4 of the Mexican Mining Law gold silver lead zinc etc. ii.
Emissions of certain substances into the atmosphere iii.
Deposit of contaminants into the soil and water and iv.
Storage of waste in public or private landfills.
The right of indigenous communities to be consulted and grant their prior and informed consent regarding mining concessions may affect the granting of new concessions in Mexico.
RESPONSEMITIGATION
Together with our internal and external advisors we filed an appeal in the form of a legal injunction before Federal Courts in Mexico.
This challenged the validity of the Tax Law on the basis that in our opinion extractive activities are regulated at a federal level.
A ruling was issued in our favour and the state of Zacatecas has filed a last appeal which is under review.
Although we believe that the initial ruling will be upheld if this is not the case we estimate that the potential net impact of these new taxes on our income statement would be in the range of US47 million for the 2017 fiscal year and subsequent years.
We continue to collaborate with other members of the mining community via the Mexican Mining Chamber to lobby against this and any other new detrimental taxes royalties or regulations.
We also support the industrys lobbying efforts to improve the general publics understanding of the Mining Law.
We remain compliant with all applicable environmental regulations and are fully committed to operating in a sustainable way.
We seek to maintain full compliance with tax authority requirements.
In doing so we continue to cooperate with any ongoing tax inspections.
Although Mexicos Mining Law does not yet incorporate indigenous consultation it remains an ongoing issue.
Some local state governments have begun to legislate on this matter as a prior requirement for mining projects to proceed in specific areas where indigenous populations may be present.
1 Corruption Perception Index 2017 issued by Transparency International ranks Mexico as 135th of 180 countries by perceived levels of public sector corruption.

RISK APPETITE
Risk rating relative position 2017 Very high 4 2016 Very high 4 LINK TO STRATEGY CHANGE IN HEAT MAP DESCRIPTION OF RISK LEVEL We have continued to experience a high level of security incidents both in frequency and severity.
The perceived level of risk has therefore remained very high.
In the regions and projects where we operate we did not observe an improvement in the crime rate during 2017.
We also refer to The Global Peace instability.
This index uses three broad themes level of safety and security in society the extent of domestic or international conflict and the degree of militarisation.
Mexico ranks 142 of 163 countries worldwide from best to worst as a country with a low state of peace and has fallen by two places in the ranking.
In addition we use the Mexico Peace Index ranking as a reference.
This is a comprehensive index of the following indicators adjusted with noncompliant rates homicides violent crimes firearms crimes nonconvicted prisoners and drug trafficking crimes.
The index ranks states from 1 to 5 where 1 represents the most peaceful.
Guerrero Zacatecas and Chihuahua tend to rank among the less peaceful states in Mexico while Sonora and Durango are located in the medium range.
KEY RISK INDICATORS Total number of security incidents affecting our workforce thefts kidnapping extortion etc.
Number of sites affected and work days lost by region and type of site.
Number of media mentions related to security issues affecting the mining industry.
SECURITY
RISK DESCRIPTION Our people contractors and suppliers face the risk of kidnapping extortion or harm due to security conditions in the regions where we operate.
We face the risk of restricted access to operationsprojects and theft of assets.
The influence of drug cartels other criminal elements and general lawlessness in the regions where we operate combined with our exploration and project activities in areas of transfer or cultivation of drugs makes working in these areas a particular risk for us.
RESPONSEMITIGATION
We closely monitor the security situation maintaining clear internal communications and coordinating work in areas of higher insecurity.
We have adopted the following practices to manage our security risks and prevent and deal with possible incidents We maintain close relations with authorities at federal state and local levels including army encampments located near the majority of our operations.
We have finalised a new standard for the technological and physical security of all our business units.
Implementation has taken more time than expected due to the extent of the new arrangements and the increased scope.
However we are planning to complete implementation for all business units during 2018.
In 2017 we launched an initiative to professionalise our security contractors.
The aim is to ensure that we only work with those who can meet our requirement to employ trained security experts.
This process will continue in 2018.
We have continued to improve our logistics controls in order to reduce the probability of theft of mineral concentrate.
These controls include the use of realtime tracking technology surveillance cameras tests to identify alterations in transported material guard services and control checkpoints in a safe corridor.
We have also reduced the number of authorised stops in order to optimise delivery times and minimise the exposure of convoys.
For example no stops are allowed on shorthaul routes.
We continue to invest in community programmes infrastructure improvements and government initiatives to support the development of lawful local communities and discourage criminal acts.
In order to ensure the security of our personnel access to the San Nicolas del Oro prospect remains suspended because of the level of insecurity in the state of Guerrero.
We plan to work together with key actors in the community to promote the benefits of mining as an alternative source of work and as a generator of improved social and educational infrastructure.
Both internally and among our contractors we continue to promote the reporting of criminal acts to the authorities.
We are evaluating the option of increasing the number of housing units close to certain business units in order to reduce the risk exposure during transportation.

SAFETY
RISK DESCRIPTION It is an inherent risk in our industry that incidents due to unsafe acts or conditions could lead to injuries or fatalities.
Our people face risks such as fire explosion electrocution and carbon monoxide poisoning as well as risks specific to each mine site and development project.
These include rock falls caused by geological conditions cyanide contamination and heavy or light equipment collisions involving machinery or personnel.
RESPONSEMITIGATION
Regrettably a fatal injury in the first half of 2017 meant that we did not reach our goal of zero fatalities.
Management has since taken decisive steps to address and prevent the root causes of fatal injuries and strengthened our safety initiatives.
These include A permanent effort to reinforce our safety culture comprising the following programmes Rules that Save Lives Operational Discipline and Behavioural Change supported by comprehensive accident investigation.
A pilot project at our Saucito mine to improve safety performance and develop competences in our supervisors.
The project involves training a group of trainers to subsequently lead the programme for the rest of the business units.
The Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate increased to 23.22 in 2017 versus 16.93 in 2016 and the Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate increased to 8.14 versus 5.99 in 2016.
We continue to deliver training for both employees and contractors.
Personnel received an average of 87 hours of training in 2017.
35 of these 87 hours involved HSECR training of which 33 related to safety.

During 2017 we successfully completed the commissioning of San Julin which had the effect of reducing our project perceived risk level.
We plan to start construction at Juanicipio in 2018.
Several factors have led us to perceive a lower level of risk for Juanicipio than for previous projects.
These include a lower level of investment easier access to infrastructure and the sites proximity to current operations.
KEY RISK INDICATORS Earned value rate of financial advancement versus physical advancement.
Percentage of major equipment ordered and received according to plan.
Percentage of completion of mine development.
PROJECTS PERFORMANCE RISK RISK DESCRIPTION The pursuit of advanced exploration and development opportunities are core to meeting our strategic goals.
However they carry certain projectrelated risks Economic viability The impact of capital cost to develop and maintain the mine future metal prices and operating costs through the mines life cycle.
Uncertainties associated with developing and operating new mines and expansion projects Fluctuations in ore grade and recovery unforeseen complexities in the mining process poor rock quality unexpected presence of underground water or lack thereof lack of community support and inability to obtain and maintain required operating permits.
Delivery risk Projects may go over budget in terms of cost and time they may not be constructed in accordance with the required specifications and major mining equipment may not be delivered on time.
RESPONSEMITIGATION
Our investment evaluation process determines how to best direct available capital using technical financial and qualitative criteria.
Technical We assess the resource estimate and confirmed resources the metallurgy of the mineral bodies the investment required in general infrastructure e. infrastructure required for the mine and plant.
Financial We look at risk relative to return for proposed investments of capital.
We set expected internal rates of return IRR per project as thresholds for approving the allocation of capital based on the present value of expected cash flows from the invested capital.
Qualitative factors The alignment of the investment with our strategic plan and business model synergies with other investments and operating assets and the implications for safety security people resourcing and community relations.
We closely monitor project controls to ensure that we deliver approved projects on time on budget and in line with the defined specifications.
The executive management team and Board of Directors are regularly updated on progress.
Each advanced exploration project and major capital development project has a risk register containing the identified and assessed risks specific to the project.
The project development pipeline in 2018 includes Ongoing construction and development of the Pyrites plant.
The Centauro Extension including a second line of the dynamic leaching plant at Herradura.

Our executive management and the Board recognise the importance of union relations and follow any developments with interest.
KEY RISK INDICATORS Union members level of satisfaction.
Number of media mentions related to mining union developments.
UNION RELATIONS RISK DESCRIPTION Although the risk of union action or a deterioration in union relations at some sites may be possible overall our relationship with the unions continues to strengthen.
Nonetheless internal union politics could impact us negatively as could pressure from other mining unions that want to take over the Fresnillo labour contract.
RESPONSEMITIGATION
Our strategy is to integrate unionised personnel into each business unit BU team.
We achieve this by clearly assigning responsibilities and programmes for maintaining close relationships with unions at mine sites and at national level.
We maintain close communication with union leaders at various levels of the organisation in order to raise awareness about the economic situation the industry is facing share our production results and to encourage union participation in our initiatives regarding safety and other operational improvements.
These initiatives include the safety guardians programme alliances for obtaining certifications integration of high productivity teams and family activities.
During the year we held six leadership workshops which were attended by 150 key union leaders at our business units.
We are proactive and timely in our responses to the needs of the unions and experienced no labourrelated work stoppages in 2017.
If required we engage experienced legal counsel both internal and external to support us on labour issues.
We will continue to closely monitor union and labour developments.

KEY RISK INDICATORS Drill programmes completed overall and by project.
Change in the number of ounces in reserves and resources.
Rate of conversion from resources to reserves.
EXPLORATION
RISK DESCRIPTION We are highly dependent on the success of the exploration programme to meet our strategic valuecreation targets and our longterm production and reserve goals.
In addition to the growing level of insecurity and access to land detailed in previous risks other risks that may impact prospecting and converting inferred resources include the lack of a robust portfolio of prospects in our pipeline with sufficient potential in terms of indicated and inferred resources and insufficient concession coverage in target areas.
We also risk the loss of purchase opportunities due to insufficient speed in decisionmaking.
As our production escalates and more mines approach the end of their lives replenishing our reserves becomes increasingly challenging.
RESPONSEMITIGATION
During 2017 we invested a total of US145.3 million in exploration activities.
Our objectives for 2018 include a budgeted risk capital investment in exploration of approximately US200 million.
The approximate spending split is 42% for operating mines 33% for exploration projects and the remaining 25% for prospects regional prospecting and mining rights.
Our exploration strategy also includes A focus on increasing regional exploration drilling programmes to intensify efforts in the districts with high potential.
For local exploration aggressive infield exploration to upgrade the resources category and convert inferred resources into reserves.
A team of highly trained and motivated geologists both employees and longterm contractors.
Advisory technical reviews by international third party experts uptodate and integrated GIS databases remote sensing imagery and software for identifying favourable metallogenic belts and districts to be fieldchecked by the team.

FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 The Directors reviewed the viability period and confirmed that a fiveyear period to December 2022 remained suitable in line with the nature of planning in the mining industry and the Companys fiveyear forecast period normally used to evaluate liquidity and contingency plans.
This is important given that our business activities cover the full value chain from exploration to mine operation.
It allows us to model capital expenditure and development programmes planned during the timeframe and reflects cash flows generated by the projects currently under development.
Due to the long business cycles in our industry the Directors considered that a shorter time period would be insufficient.
Reporting on the Companys viability requires the Directors to consider those principal risks that could impair the solvency and liquidity of the
In order to determine those risks the Directors robustly assessed the Groupwide principal risks and operationspecific risks by undertaking consultations with executive management mine managers and other personnel across our operations.
Through these conversations the Directors also identified low probability high loss scenarios  singular events with the potential magnitude to severely impact the solvency andor liquidity of Fresnillo.
For the purpose of assessing the Groups viability the Directors identified that of the principal risks detailed on page 35 the following are the most important Impact of metal prices and global macroeconomic developments specifically volatility in the prices of gold and silver over a period of time.
Access to land.
Potential actions by the government which could include a delay in obtaining permits andor new restrictive regulations.
Environmental incidents.
It was determined that none of the individual risks would in isolation compromise the Groups viability.
The
Directors therefore went on to Group principal risks into the following severe but plausible scenarios in each case determining the risk proximity how soon the risk could occur and velocity the speed with which the impact of a risk could be felt Scenario 1 Impact of metal prices and global macroeconomic developments.
Over a period of a year precious metal prices fall and then remain at a low level for the following four years of the viability period varying between US11301225 per gold oz.
US15.417.0 per silver oz.
To create this impartial projection for the future low metal price environment the Directors used an average of the three lowest forecasts from each year of the assessment based on consensus estimates published by institutional financial analysts.
This low metal price environment was deemed to be the most significant risk and pervasive across the Company.
Principal risk Scenario 2 Bench collapse at an open pit mine.
A landslide occurs covering the lower pit of one of our mines.
Due to the unexpected nature of the event fatalities occur .
Production is gradually ramped back up and reestablished to full capacity.
Singular event Scenario 3 Tailings dam breach at a mine.
A tailings dam collapses and tailings are released into the surrounding area causing environmental damage.
A fund is created by the Company to be used to remediate and compensate for any damages caused.
The investigation into the causes of the event is drawn out and further time is needed for all environmental permits to be reinstated.
As a result the mine remains closed throughout the viability assessment period.
Principal risk Scenario 4 Flooding at a mine.
An unforeseen fault containing water is cut into with water then entering the mine in excess of pumping capacity thereby halting production of one of the main areas in the mine.
The rampup to preevent production levels commences once management determines that it is safe to do so.
Singular event Scenario 5 Action by the government at a mine.
Explosives are stolen on site causing the authorities to suspend the mines explosives permit.
Production is halted while an investigation into the matter is completed.
Once permits have been restored production ramps back up to preevent levels.
Principal risk Scenario 6 Access to land at a mine.
Conflicts with local communities arise resulting in the Company having to cease operations until negotiations can be finalised and the land can be reoccupied.
Principal risk Scenario 7 San Julin suspension due to government actions.
Members of the local community are poisoned due to the rupturing of a cyanide tank.
Pressure from social activists results in the Mexican government withdrawing all permits with no intention of reinstating them in the future.
This leads to the permanent closure of the San Julin mine for the duration of the viability period while mitigating actions are executed.

The hypothetical scenarios above are extremely severe in order to create outcomes that have the ability to threaten the viability of the Group.
However multiple control measures are in place to prevent and mitigate any such occurrences.
Should any of these scenarios take place various options are available to the Company in order to maintain sufficient liquidity to continue in operation.
When quantifying the expected financial impact and remediation time required for each of these risks management performed benchmarking against the Groups own experience and against publicly available information on relevant similar incidents in the mining industry.
All scenarios were first evaluated using average metal prices and once the mitigation plans had been applied where necessary it was decided that there was no threat to the viability of the
To create a more stringent test and further challenge the resilience of the Group all scenarios were then overlaid with scenario one low metal prices and then reevaluated.
When these scenarios were re modelled none led to an extremely low or negative cash balance because the strong cash balance at the end of 2017 US896 million comprising cash and cash equivalents of US876 million and investment fund available for sale of US20 million positions Fresnillo plc in a healthy financial situation.
In addition the current macroeconomic circumstances metal prices and exchange rates MXNUSD contribute to the preservation of a positive cash balance position through the scenarios assessed.
The lowest cash balance level was identified in scenario number seven in combination with the low metal prices scenario.
However even in this scenario a positive cash balance would be maintained throughout the viability period with a minimum level of US197 million during the third year  meaning that mitigating actions would not be required.
Risk management and internal control systems are in place page 34 throughout the Group.
Through the internal control systems the Directors monitor key variables that have the ability to impact the liquidity and solvency of the Group and we are confident that management is able to sufficiently mitigate any situations as they might occur .
Risk mitigation and control measures that are in place include a Crisis Committee while the Board would also be briefed and convened as necessary in order to respond to events as they develop.
Dedicated personnel for managing media engaging with authorities and other stakeholders are appointed at each level of the organisation depending on the magnitude of the crisis.
In connection with longerterm viability the US800 million Senior Notes issued in 2013 are due for repayment in 2023 one year after the end of the viability review period.
It is currently anticipated that all or part of these US800 million will be refinanced.
If however market conditions then will not permit refinancing on acceptable terms under all the scenarios outlined above with depressed metal prices the Company would have adequate resources to repay the US800 million in full.
Based on the results of this robust analysis and having considered the established controls for the risks and the available mitigating actions the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the fiveyear period of their detailed assessment.
This longer term assessment process supports the Directors statements on both viability as set out above and going concern set out below.
1 The average metals price derived from a range of Financial Institutions analysis as of December 2017.
GOING CONCERN STATEMENT The Groups business activities together with the factors likely to affect its future development performance and position are set out above in the Strategic Review on pages 8115.
The financial position of the Group its cash flows and liquidity position are described in the Financial Review in pages 104115.
In addition note 31 to the financial statements includes the Groups objectives policies and processes for managing its capital its financial risk management objectives details of its financial instruments and hedging activities and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
In making their assessment of the Groups ability to manage its future cash requirements the Directors have considered the Company and Group budgets and the cash flow forecasts for the period to 31 December 2019.
In addition they reviewed a more conservative cash flow scenario with reduced silver and gold prices of US15.6 and US1133 respectively throughout this period while maintaining current budgeted expenditure approved by the Executive
This resulted in our current cash balances reducing over time but maintaining ample liquidity throughout the period.
The Directors have further calculated prices US12.5 and US865 for silver and gold respectively which should they prevail to the end of 2019 would result in cash balances decreasing to minimal levels by the end of 2019 without applying mitigations.
Should metal prices remain below the stressed prices above for an extended period management have identified specific elements of capital and exploration expenditures which could be deferred without adversely affecting production profiles throughout the period.
Finally management could amend the mining plans to concentrate on production with a higher margin in order to accelerate cash generation without affecting the integrity of the mine plans.
After reviewing all of the above considerations the Directors have a reasonable expectation that management have sufficient flexibility in adverse circumstances to maintain adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The
Directors therefore continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND CYBER SECURITY At Fresnillo we have continued to invest in the latest intelligent solutions in order to improve safety productivity and decisionmaking.

The
Committees main responsibilities are to Review technology options for business process innovation.
Select the best technology ensure alignment with business strategy and prioritise projects.
Strengthen cyber security framework and protocols.
Develop and oversee a technology implementation budget.
Reward results not activities.
CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN 2017 The implementation of key technologies has helped us take great strides towards safer and more productive operations.
During the last year we made significant progress on extending the benefits of these solutions across our mine portfolio.
This included further implementation of three key programmes Ventilation Plus at San Julin Cinega Saucito and Fresnillo Track Plus at Saucito San Julin and Cinega and ProxAlarm at San Julin Cinega and Herradura.
2017 also saw the initial implementation of several projects including ProxAlarm and MineOps Optimiser at Noche Buena.
In addition at Herradura we have started work to introduce a Fatigue Monitoring project aimed at reducing operator error and a Slope Monitoring project that will help optimise the pit wall slope angles as well as creating a safer place to work.
We expect full implementation of all these programmes to be completed by the third quarter of 2018.
Looking further ahead by 2023 we expect to have implemented the One View project at our corporate office in Mexico City and the Intelligent Plants projects at all our plants.
Additional technology projects will be prioritised and evaluated for implementation by the IT Governance Committee going forward.

Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies COBIT which was created by ISACA the international professional association for IT management and governance to provide an implementable set of ITrelated controls processes and enablers.
IMPROVING HOW WE RESPOND TO POTENTIAL INCIDENTS A timely and targeted response can play a major role in minimising any potential damage resulting from a cyber security incident.
During 2017 we collaborated with Peoles in a joint project aimed at developing clear and consistent processes to guide our stakeholders in their response to any information security incidents.
A key aspect of the challenge is to ensure that our culture supports our people in their ability to adapt behaviours and follow new policies and procedures.
We have already made significant headway with this project and anticipate full completion by April 2019.
Towards the end of the year we also commissioned consultants Deloitte to support our cyber security initiatives by Defining a formal cyber security strategy and governance.
Reviewing and assessing risks present on our core business processes.

THIS IS THE MOST ADVANCED MINE IN OUR PORTFOLIO WITH LEADING EDGE TECHNOLOGY AND A HIGHLY SKILLED WORKFORCE DELIVERING IMPRESSIVE EFFICIENCIES INCLUDING ABOVECAPACITY
WE EXPECT THE MINE TO ACHIEVE AVERAGE ANNUAL PRODUCTION OF 14.2 MOZ OF SILVER AND 49.3 KOZ OF GOLD AND BELIEVE THAT SAN JULIN HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BECOME ESTABLISHED AS AN ENTIRELY NEW MINING DISTRICT UNDERPINNING OUR LONG TERM GOALS.
Roberto Daz Chief Operating Officer 54 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 REVIEW OF OPERATIONS KEY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE YEAR Silver production increased 4.1% over 2016 due to the higher volumes of ore processed and the higher ore grade resulting from access to certain high grade veins at San Alberto and San Carlos.
Despite the increase in silver production we continued experiencing delays in development.
The average development rate for the year was 3366 metres per month as a result of lower productivity from contractors and mining equipment failures which impeded longhole drilling activities.

MINES IN OPERATION FRESNILLO To address this situation we are implementing a plan that includes hiring additional contractors working with existing contractors to improve their performance and improving equipment maintenance.
We expect these measures to maintain current development rates in the short term while increasing them in the long term.
We continued investing in optimisation projects during the year .
For example we installed a vertical conveyor to reduce truck haulage at the deeper levels of the mine.
We also made progress with the project to increase plant capacity to 9000 tonnes per day with the installation of the zinc thickener .
The second stage of this project will be to install additional flotation cells with the final stage being the installation of the vibrating screens.
We expect these stages to be completed in the next couple of years and anticipate that the project will result in an additional average annual production of three million ounces of silver once commissioned by the end of 2019.
For 2018 we expect the silver ore grade to be around 235 gt while lead and zinc ore grades are expected to be in the region of 0.96% and 1.77% respectively.
For the following five years the silver ore grade is expected to remain around 230250 gt.
Silver resources remained broadly unchanged as a result of the addition of inferred resources offset by a decrease in measured and indicated resources due to depletion and lower grade infill drilling results.
Silver reserves decreased due to depletion lower grade infill drilling and a higher cutoff grade resulting from the increase in allin sustaining costs.
CAPITAL EXPENDITURES Total capex allocation in 2017 was US111.7 million mainly for mine development sustaining capex the deepening of the San Carlos shaft and CONTINUED FOCUS ON IMPROVEMENT IN PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCIES ACROSS OUR ASSETS ALLOWS US TO MEET PRODUCTION TARGETS.

FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 REVIEW OF OPERATIONS
KEY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE YEAR Annual silver production decreased slightly to 21.2 million ounces in 2017 as a result of the expected lower ore grade.
This was mainly due to the higher grade development ore processed in 2016 and the restricted access to high grade areas resulting from the anchoring activities to avoid rock instability.
These factors more than offset the higher volume of ore processed.
In 2018 the expected silver ore grade will be around 285 gt due to regaining access to higher ore grade areas.
The
Silver ore grade is expected to remain stable at this level in the next three years.
However the gold ore grade is expected to increase gradually reaching c.
1.3 gt by 2020.

MINES IN OPERATION SAUCITO The 2017 drilling programme was focused on further resource generation and infill drilling aimed at upgrading the resource category into reserves.
This was achieved with increases in both silver resources and reserves though this campaign will continue into 2018.
The preparation of ramps and infrastructure for the hoist and equipment to deepen the Jarillas shaft continued and in 2018 we will initiate the deepening of the shaft from 630 metres to 1000 metres.
This project aims to provide access to the deeper reserves in the Jarillas vein.
CAPITAL EXPENDITURES Capital expenditures in 2017 totalled US133.7 million primarily allocated to inmine development and sustaining capex the construction of the Pyrites plant and the deepening of the Jarillas shaft project.
In 2018 capex will primarily be allocated to maintaining development rates the deepening of the Jarillas shaft and the construction of the Pyrites plant see page 66.
Other minor investments will include continuing the implementation of Ventilation Plus and ProxAlarm systems see pages 5051.
Adjusted revenue at Saucito decreased by 4.5% mainly as a result of the lower volumes sold and lower precious metal prices.
The mines contribution to consolidated silver revenue decreased to 39.7% in 2017 2016 48.5% although Saucito remained the main contributor to consolidated silver revenues.
Gold contributed 16.1% to Saucitos revenue 2016 18.5% representing 7.2% of the Groups gold revenue.
Cost per tonne increased 29.3% to US47.6 mainly due to i lower volume of ore processed from development works ii increases in the use of consumables services and maintenance and iii cost inflation 7.7%.

KEY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE YEAR Annual gold production remained stable as the expected lower ore grade was offset by the increase in ore processed resulting from improved equipment availability.
This followed on from efficiencies achieved in the maintenance programme.
Silver production increased 5.1% yearon year due to the higher ore grade at the Taspana and San Ramn veins.
Taspana is an area located 30 kilometres away from the main Cinega mine.
We expect its contribution to continue rising in the future and for Taspana to become another satellite mine.
In 2018 the average gold ore grade is expected to remain stable at 1.8 gt and silver ore grade is expected to average 160 gt.
From 2019 to 2021 the gold ore grade is expected to average 2.0 gt and silver ore grade to be around 160170 gt.

MINES IN OPERATION CINEGA Our exploration programme confirmed a continuation of the ore body at the RosarioLas Casas veins which would justify an expansion of the beneficiation plant to 5000 tpd at the Cinega mine.
We expect to commence basic engineering for this expansion in 2018.
Gold and silver resources increased as a result of exploration efforts in the RosarioLas Casas and Taspana veins.
Inferred resources increased while measured and indicated resources decreased due to depletion and a higher cutoff grade.
Gold and silver reserves decreased as a result of the increased cutoff grade resulting from the higher allin sustaining costs.
CAPITAL EXPENDITURES Capex in 2017 totalled US46.5 million and was allocated to mine development sustaining capex construction of the third tailings dam and land acquisition.
Budgeted capex for 2018 will mainly be allocated to mining works sustaining capex and construction of the third tailings dam.
Adjusted revenue increased to US198.3 million in 2017 due mainly to increased volumes of silver and zinc sold and higher gold lead and zinc prices.
Cinega is the Groups most polymetallic mine a fact demonstrated by the increased contribution from silver lead and zinc from 54.7% in 2016 to 57.2% in 2017.
Cost per tonne at Cinega increased 19.9% to US66.5 due to i the increase in development works recognised in the income statement ii increases in the use of consumables services and maintenance and iii cost inflation 6.3%.
Cash cost per gold ounce was US163.7 an increase compared to US217.2 in 2016 as a result of the higher cost per tonne and lower gold ore grade partly offset by higher byproduct credits.
Margin per ounce decreased to US1431.1 in 2017 2016 US1463.66.

KEY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE YEAR Annual gold production decreased 9.0% as a result of the expected reduction in inventories at Herradura in 2016 not being repeated to the same extent during 2017 and the lower ore grade of mineral deposited at Herradura.
These factors were partly offset by the higher volume of ore processed.
Following further optimisation of the inventory levels at the leaching pads no additional decreases are expected in 2018.
Gold ore grades in 2018 are expected to average 0.75 gt.
This is expected to increase to 0.80 gt in subsequent years with minor fluctuations anticipated depending on the mine plan.
The construction of the second line at the DLP continued with commissioning expected in the second quarter of 2018.
This US110 million project will increase efficiency as we process sulphides found deeper in the pit.

We have now decided to carry out an additional 130000 metres of drilling in 2018 to further optimise the pit shell and improve the financial metrics of this project.
Gold reserves increased as a result of the ongoing effort to upgrade the increased resources reported in 2016 into reserves.
However gold resources decreased as result of an estimated higher life of mine allin sustaining cost and stricter geotechnical parameters required for the expanded open pit.
CAPITAL EXPENDITURES Capital expenditures in 2017 totalled US153.2 million which included mine preparation sustaining capex and the construction of the second line at the DLP .
Capex for 2018 will mainly be focused on mining works sustaining capex the construction of additional leaching pads the second line at the DLP and land acquisition.
Minor investments will include the implementation of the Fatigue Monitoring system and SmartOps system see pages 5051.
Adjusted revenue decreased 7.5% to US606.8 million reflecting the lower volumes of gold sold.
Cost per tonne of ore deposited increased 3.9% to US8.0.
This was lower than the estimated cost inflation at this mine of 6.7% mainly due to the lower stripping costs charged to production costs.
Cash cost per gold ounce increased 4.7% to US492.9 as a result of the higher cost per tonne and lower gold ore grade.
Margin per ounce and margin expressed as a percentage of gold prices remained broadly stable at US774.6 and 61.1% respectively see page 110.

KEY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE YEAR Annual gold production decreased 5.5% due to the lower overall speed of recovery resulting from the ores kinetic characteristics.
This was partly offset by the higher volume of ore processed resulting from the optimisation of the haulage routes which led to shorter distances and a higher ore grade.
We remained focused on improving efficiency and reducing costs which included the ongoing relocation of waste dumps to reduce haulage distance and increasing the useful lifetime of vehicle components and tyres.

Two new areas with mineralisation were identified in 2017.
Despite the limited upside potential the Navidad pit contributed to this years gold production while ore from the Ao Nuevo pit helped to replace reserves at this mine.
Gold reserves and resources continued to decrease as a result of the natural depletion of the pits.
CAPITAL EXPENDITURES Capital expenditures in 2017 totalled US18.7 million focused on mining works and sustaining capex including the construction of leaching pads to guarantee operational continuity.
Spend in 2018 will again primarily be in sustaining capex including leaching pad number 7 and the implementation of the ProxAlarm system see pages 5051.
Adjusted revenue at Noche Buena decreased 4.6% to US215.5 million reflecting the lower volumes of gold sold.
Cost per tonne at this mine remained stable at US7.5.
This was lower than the estimated cost inflation at this mine of 5.1% mainly due to the lower stripping costs charged to production costs.
Cash cost per gold ounce increased 3.6% to US793.5.
Margin per ounce decreased to US474.0 while margin expressed as a percentage of the gold price decreased to 37.4% in 2017 see page 110.

KEY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE YEAR Silver and gold production at San Julin Veins phase I was 5.9 million ounces and 82.8 thousand ounces respectively reflecting the first complete year of operating at full capacity and the achievement of reaching a milling capacity of over 3800 tonnes per day.
In 2018 the silver ore grade is expected to average around 150 gt and gold ore grade to average 1.7 gt.
Both grades are expected to remain broadly stable in the following three years.
We completed the construction of San Julin phase IIflotation plant on budget in midJuly.
The milling facility achieved processing nameplate capacity of 6000 tonnes per day in the third quarter of the year and has produced five million ounces of silver since its commission.
In 2018 the San Julin JM phase II silver ore grade is expected to be around 185 gt with the gold ore grade averaging around 0.10 gt.
The silver ore grade is expected to increase in the next three years and to fluctuate within a range of 160210 gt.
Capex spend in 2017 was US79.1 million mainly related to the completion of the construction of the flotation plant at San Julin JM phase II.
Budgeted capex for 2018 will mainly be allocated to mining works sustaining capex construction of the third tailings dam and implementation of the Track Plus ProxAlarm and Mine Optimiser systems see pages 5051.
Adjusted revenue and adjusted production costs increased reflecting the first complete year of operations at San Julin phase I and the start of commercial production at San Julin phase II.
Cost per tonne and cash cost are not considered to be representative as they correspond to the startup period and in addition a significant volume of the stock pile was processed during this period.

EXPLORATION
EXPLORATION IS THE LIFEBLOOD OF FRESNILLO  IT IS A KEY COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE AND BOTH THE FOUNDATION OF OUR PAST ACHIEVEMENTS AND THE PLATFORM FOR OUR FUTURE.
Delivered by a team of talented dedicated geologists our strategic commitment to continuous exploration across all precious metals price cycles is in marked contrast to the approaches adopted by many of our peers.
While they have tended to cut back their efforts in the face of challenging market conditions we have maintained our focus and continued to invest in order to build a robust pipeline of reserves and resources.
A TALENTED TEAM Around 100 geologists form the backbone of our exploration activities.
Many members of this team have extensive experience including detailed knowledge of our existing assets and associated mineralisation clues backed by a track record of finding new projects and turning them into operating mines.
They are supported by younger geologists in training as well as by some 300 assistants drawn from local communities.
BACKED BY TECHNOLOGY AND GUIDED BY STRICT CRITERIA We ensure that our team is provided with the tools to do their job at all times by investing in training and technology across price cycles.
The latest geospatial geological geochemical and geophysical technologies including satellite imagery and hyperspectral techniques among others constitute the foundations that increase the probability that our geologists will make the next discovery.
Our approach is to evaluate opportunities within existing mines and at new locations against a set of strict criteria  including a minimum potential of 100 moz of silver or 2 moz of gold equivalent  to ensure they meet our operational and revenue objectives.
We also evaluate further factors before commencing activities such as ore grades metallurgical recoveries extraction costs environmental impact and community costs.
Only those projects that score well against these requirements receive a green light.
2017 PERFORMANCE During 2017 our exploration activities were focused on our existing mines notably Herradura Fresnillo Saucito Cinega and San Julin.
These mines are underexplored and offer a great deal of potential.
For example at both the Cinega and the Fresnillo mines the main systems were extended to the East and West respectively.
In terms of projects we prioritised those that are more advanced  and one of the highlights of the year was the conversion of resources from inferred to indicated at Guanajuato.
This is an important step towards opening a mine in the district and although we will continue to carry out studies in 2018 we can envisage Guanajuato becoming an important part of the Fresnillo operational portfolio in future years.
At Juanicipio we deployed a directional drill to improve accuracy and while delays in setting up the equipment resulted in a shortfall in our planned drilling programme for the year this will have no adverse impact on project delivery dates.
The main challenge for our exploration team during the year was again access to land  and we continue to work closely with communities across our portfolio.
For example in Chile we have now evaluated over 100 properties and are currently negotiating access to our preferred locations.
RESERVES AND RESOURCES To estimate resources and calculate reserves we use the 2012 edition of the JORC code.
We used a gold price of US1250oz across our operations which for our open pit resources represents a decrease of US150.
The change brings us into line with our peers and more accurately reflects our conservative standpoint.
The price used for silver resources and reserves was reduced to US17.0oz with an immaterial effect in resources 146 ounces.
Silver reserves fell by 5.4% as we did not replace reserves at Fresnillo while those of gold rose by 22.7% due to good results at Herradura.
Our silver resources grew by 6.9% in 2017 largely due to intensive exploration at Saucito and gold resources remained stable.
Total resources for the Group currently stand at 2320.5 moz of silver and 38.5 moz of gold.
Highlights of 2017 5.4% decrease in silver reserves.
22.7% increase in gold reserves.
6.9% increase in silver resources.
0.3% increase in gold resources.
Priorities for 2018 Continue exploration activities at all existing mines.
Continue negotiations for access to land at advanced projects.
Roll out communication programmes to explain the benefits of mining across all of our operations.
Continue deep drilling at Juanicipio.
Conclude the feasibility study at Juanicipio and carry out a feasibility study at Centauro
Undertake a preliminary economic assessment at Orisyvo and Guanajuato.

The consolidation of mining districts is one of our key strategies and allows us to leverage local knowledge and shared infrastructure.
The following section examines the exploration potential of each of our four principal districts as well as key development projects in our pipeline.
FRESNILLO DISTRICT As a preeminent silver mining district located in the heart of Mexico this region is largely responsible for making Fresnillo plc the largest producer of silver in the world.
The districts strengths include a long history of mining activities a skilled workforce and good infrastructure.
Our team of geologists have harnessed these advantages while leveraging their own local and regional knowledge in order to maximise the districts longterm potential.
During 2017 87208 metres of drilling was carried out in the area.
Juanicipio a joint venture project with MAG Silver where Fresnillo owns 56% is a standalone project located just eight kilometres from the Fresnillo mine.
Exploration in 2017 was focused on the depth extension of the Valdecaas vein and we are currently in the process of concluding a feasibility study.
SAN JULIN DISTRICT Located on the Chihuahua and Durango border San Julin began life as a greenfield project ten years ago.
The mines second phase was fully commissioned in July 2017 following a US515m capital investment programme.
Our exploration team continues to explore and identify new targets in the area through our district consolidation strategy.
The teams findings  supported by the significant investment already in place  endorse our view that San Julin has the potential to become established as an entirely new mining district underpinning our long term goals.
During 2017 our intensive drilling programme continued totalling 73995 metres.
By deploying an integrated approach that combines geophysics geochemistry geology and drilling we were able to increase gold resources by 63 koz and silver resources by 5 moz in the southern part of the district where numerous exploration targets remain untested.
The 2018 programme includes intensified drilling in this sector and definition of drill targets in the northern part of the district where surface exploration work is commencing.
HERRADURA DISTRICT Located in the north west of Mexico the Herradura district is home to the Herradura Noche Buena and Soledad Dipolos mines as well as Centauro Deep a strategically important project located below the existing Centauro pit.
The district accounted for 70% of our total gold production in 2017.
Exploration continues to focus on brownfield targets particularly on the Centauro Deep extension.
CINEGA DISTRICT Situated in the Sierra Madre mountain range this district contains our most polymetallic mine Cinega in addition to the San Ramn satellite mine and the Taspana development works.
We have carried out several comprehensive brownfield exploration programmes in the district and these have identified a number of targets.
The projects that have shown the greatest potential are now undergoing further analysis.
Last year the exploration campaign was intensified at the Taspana and Tajos veins where mining and preparation works are advancing at a good pace.
In 2018 our plans include to drilltest extensions of the veins along strike and at depth and to evaluate other opportunities in the district.
DURING 2017 OUR EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES WERE FOCUSED ON HERRADURA FRESNILLO SAUCITO CINEGA AND SAN JULIN.

However while management can establish and promote safetyled processes the everyday behaviour of workers themselves remains a key factor in reducing incidents.
During the year we launched a new initiative at our Saucito mine aimed at reinforcing the importance of safety in our corporate culture.
The I care we care programme recognises and rewards extraordinary safety behaviour to emphasise the role that individual actions and attitudes play in building a safe working environment.
Employees and contractors have been trained to recognise desired safety behaviours with the programme using a cardbased system to reward teams and individuals who exhibit best practices.
Poor examples of safety behaviours are also highlighted by the programme and used by supervisors to demonstrate areas for improvement.

WATER STEWARDSHIP OUR GOAL To increase access to safe water by minimising our water footprint and cooperating with our stakeholders notably communities authorities and NGOs.
Although we operate in a number of arid regions the mining and processing of ore requires large volumes of water and this is often a relevant issue for local communities.
We recognise that water is a human right and cooperate with communities to increase water access.
Securing access and being responsible water stewards are critical success factors and the prevention of environmental impacts on water resources and related ecosystems is fundamental to our social and environmental licences to operate.
Before we commence any project we carry out EIAs to gain knowledge of water resources and their vulnerability on a local and regional scale.
Responding to the expectations of our stakeholders we conduct our evaluation of water risk using the Aqueduct tool from the World Resources Institute WRI.
HOW WE WILL WIN Enabler  Operational excellence to reduce our water footprint.
Key activities Implement closed water circuits eliminating the need to discharge processed water into water streams.
Reuse wastewater from municipalities and our own operations and camps.
Enabler  Environmental compliance and cooperation with local stakeholders.
Key activities Secure water rights from authorities before using any water in mining and mineral processing.
Send unused water from dewatering to settlement ponds to control suspended solids before discharging the cleaned water downstream.
Respect our water quotas monitoring our discharges and taking action to ensure that they adhere to water quality regulations.
Cooperate with water authorities and other stakeholders including communities to increase water access.

2017 HIGHLIGHTS
We continued to partner the NGO International Board on Books for Young People IBBY bringing books and children together through our Picando Letras programme.
This programme currently benefits 8186 children in 66 schools  from kindergartens to high schools in local communities close to our Cinega Penmont Saucito Fresnillo San Julin Rodeo and Gigante Guanajuato mines and projects.
Together with the NGO INNOVEC and the Zacatecas State government we supported a programme to teach science in an experiential and engaging manner .
A total of 3776 children in the Fresnillo area are currently benefiting from this programme.
We partnered with local schools in Fresnillo Caborca Penmont and Turuachi San Julin and entered three teams in the FIRST For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology Robotics competition.
With the support of mentors from the Company children aged from 15 to 18 learnt how to develop their expertise in robotics as well as the importance of teamwork and volunteering.
Capacity building We continued to promote the development of regional value chains by participating in the established mining clusters of Zacatecas and Sonora and also joined the Chihuahua mining cluster during 2017.
The Zacatecas cluster brings together 16 mining operations 73 local suppliers five universities five local government agencies and three company research centres.
The Sonora cluster comprises 102 suppliers 19 mining operations eight universities and six chambers and associations.
To diversify local economies we provided training for entrepreneurs in the communities of Fresnillo and Uruachi one of our exploration areas.
Health
In partnership with the National University Foundation we organised Health Weeks in Fresnillo Cinega Penmont San Julin and at our Rodeo project benefiting a total of 11400 people during the year .
Water and infrastructure We piloted a project in partnership with Captar AC to implement rainwater collection in the community of Las Papas in San Julin.
We continued to engage with the municipalities campaigning for higher levels of investment by the Mining Fund in the communities neighbouring our operations.

CASE STUDY BRINGING BOOKS AND CHILDREN TOGETHER Our activities bring employment and financial benefits to local workers  and we also work hard to support their families through a wide range of community initiatives.
During 2017 we again continued to work with the NGO International Board on Books for Young People IBBY to bring books and children together through its respected Picando Letras programme.
The aim of the programme is to create a space where teachers parents youngsters and children interact raise awareness and reflect as a result of reading in an enjoyable free and meaningful manner .
This strengthens community bonds educates people so they can selfreflect express their feelings and thoughts and really listen to others in a tolerant and respectful environment.
The team from IBBY guided us on the choice of books and initial teacher training as well as on how to monitor progress and coach the teachers.
With their valuable support we expanded the project in 2017 and opened more bunkos small community libraries where volunteers read aloud to children and facilitate discussions.
Over the course of the year we helped a total of 8186 children from 66 schools  from kindergartens to high schools  in the communities of Cinega Penmont Saucito Fresnillo San Julin Rodeo and Gigante Guanajuato.
CASE STUDY ENSURING HEALTHY LIVES AND PROMOTING
Nothing is more important to us than our people which is why we use our expertise and resources to help ensure they lead healthy lives.
This is particularly important in some of our local communities where access to healthcare is a stakeholder concern either due to remote location or low socioeconomic levels.
In 2017 we worked closely with the UNAM Foundation NGOs and local health authorities to foster a preventive and selfcare culture.
The programme benefited more than 11435 people from over 100 communities from Penmont Fresnillo District Cinega and San Julin.
These benefits included free eye care dental care vaccination and diabetes detection and also raised awareness of issues such as the importance of good eating habits.

We recognise that these are complex and lifechanging issues for communities.
When poorly planned and managed land acquisition and resettlement can adversely impact the livelihoods and social structure of communities damage our relationships or even cause conflict.
We recognise that the right to an adequate standard of living after land acquisition and resettlement projects is a basic human right.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
By following strict controls on cash costs and expenses and while adhering to our capex budgets we have maintained a healthy cash and other liquid funds position and a low leverage ratio.
This has enabled us to invest in profitable growth and deliver solid returns to shareholders.
The following report presents how we have managed our Financial Capital.
COMMENTARY ON FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE This has been another year of progress for Fresnillo as we continued our longestablished reputation for creating value through growth and returns.
Gross profit and EBITDA increased during the year by 4.9% and 2.7% respectively.
We also maintained a solid financial position with US896.0 million in cash and other liquid funds as of 31 December 2017 despite paying dividends of US236.6 million in accordance with our policy and investing capex of US604.8 million to underpin our future growth.
A number of factors contributed to the increase in gross profit and EBITDA including the increased contribution of San Julin to silver and zinc sales together with higher gold and base metals prices which increased Adjusted revenue.
These factors were partly offset by cost pressures higher depreciation charges and exploration expenses and these together with the sale of a nonstrategic exploration project and the effect of the revaluation of the Mexican pesoUS dollar spot exchange rate on deferred taxes resulted in an increase of 32.0% in net profit for the year .

The Groups financial performance is largely determined by the quality of our assets the skills of our personnel and the execution capabilities of management to achieve our strategic goals.
However there are a number of macroeconomic variables that lie beyond our control and which affect financial results.
These include PRECIOUS METAL PRICES In 2017 the average realised gold and silver prices remained broadly stable at US1267.4 per ounce 2016 US1246.5 and US17.0 per ounce 2016 US17.2 respectively.
However the average realised lead and zinc prices increased 24.9% and 34.9% yearonyear to US1.06 and US1.36 per pound respectively.
We hedged a portion of our byproduct lead and zinc production but contrary to previous years this did not have an effect on revenue.
MXUS EXCHANGE RATE The Mexican pesoUS dollar spot exchange rate at 31 December 2017 was 19.74 per US dollar compared to 20.66 per US dollar at 31 December 2016.
The 4.5% spot revaluation had a favourable effect primarily on deferred income taxes.
This positively compared versus the 20.1% devaluation in 2016 which resulted in a significant adverse effect on deferred income taxes.
The average spot Mexican pesoUS dollar exchange rate devalued by 1.5% from 18.66 per US dollar in 2016 to 18.94 per US dollar in 2017.
This resulted in a favourable effect estimated at US4.7 million on the Groups production costs as costs denominated in Mexican pesos approximately 45% of total costs were lower when converted to US dollars.
COST INFLATION In 2017 there was a net increase in the weighted average input cost over the year of 6.4%.
This inflation included the positive effect of the 1.5% average devaluation of the Mexican peso against the US dollar .
LABOUR
Unionised employees received on average a 5.8% increase in wages in Mexican pesos and administrative employees at the mines received a 4.5% increase when converted to US dollars the weighted average labour inflation was 3.3%.
ENERGY
ELECTRICITY
The Groups weighted average cost of electricity increased by 28.9% from US5.9 cents per kW in 2016 to US7.6 cent per kW in 2017.
This increase was mainly explained by the higher average generating cost of the Comisin Federal de Electricidad CFE the national utility following the increase in the prices of natural gas and fuel and to a lesser extent of imported coal.
DIESEL
The weighted average cost of diesel in US dollars increased 22.2% to US76.5 cents per litre in 2017 compared to US62.6 cents per litre in 2016 reflecting the price liberalisation of fuels.
OPERATING MATERIALS Year over year change in unit price % Other reagents 31.1 Steel balls for milling 3.0 Lubricants 1.0 Tyres 5.2 Explosives 6.4 Sodium cyanide 17.3 Weighted average of all operating materials 1.1 Unit prices of the majority of certain operating materials decreased in US dollar terms.
However this was mostly offset by the increase in the unit price of other reagents particularly those linked to the price of copper and zinc reflecting the higher metals prices.
As a result the weighted average unit prices of all operating materials decreased by 1.1% over the year .
There has been no significant impact on the unit cost of operating materials from the devaluation of the MXN pesoUS dollar exchange rate as the majority of these items are dollardenominated.
CONTRACTORS
Agreements are signed individually with each contractor company and include specific terms and conditions that cover not only labour but also operating materials equipment and maintenance amongst others.
Contractor costs are mainly denominated in Mexican pesos and are an important component of our total production costs.
In 2017 increases granted to contractors whose agreements were due for review during the period resulting in a weighted average increase of 4.9% in US dollars.
MAINTENANCE
Unit prices of spare parts for maintenance remained unchanged on average in US dollar terms 0.4% increase.
FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Other cost components include freight which increased by an estimated 12.5% in US dollars offset by a 10.0% decrease in insurance costs.
The remaining components had an average inflation of 0.8% in US dollars over 2016.
The effects of the above external factors combined with the Groups internal variables are further described below through the main line items of the income statement.

The remaining 39.0% or US73.4 million was explained by the benefit of higher gold lead and zinc prices.
As expected the contribution of San Julin changed the relative proportion of Adjusted revenue with silver revenue representing 38% of total Adjusted revenue in 2017 compared to 35% in 2016.
Gold contribution to Adjusted revenue decreased from 55% in 2016 to 50% in 2017 as a result of the expected decrease in volumes of gold sold.
The contribution of byproduct lead and zinc to the Groups Adjusted revenue increased from 9% in 2016 to 12% in 2017 due to higher lead and zinc prices and the increased volumes of zinc sold primarily from the San Julin and Fresnillo mines.
Herradura remained the main contributor to Adjusted revenue reflecting a further decrease in gold inventories during the year .
Saucito continued to be the second largest contributor although its contribution declined from 26% in 2016 to 23% in 2017 in line with a 4.5% decrease in Adjusted revenue.
Fresnillos contribution remained stable at 19% notwithstanding the 10.0% increase in total Group Adjusted revenue.
San Julin phase I and phase II contributed 13% to the Groups Adjusted revenue.
The relative contribution to silver Adjusted revenue changed over the year with San Julin phase I and II representing 18.6% while the contributions of Saucito Fresnillo and Cinega decreased as expected reflecting an expanded silver asset base.
Similarly contribution to gold revenue was modified with the San Julin mine representing 9.3% of total Adjusted gold revenue.

In 2017 we entered into a series of derivative contracts to hedge part of our lead and zinc byproduct production through collar structures.
These contracts will start to mature in 2018.
As no hedging structures expired in 2017 there was no effect on revenue.

TREATMENT AND REFINING CHARGES Treatment and refining charges are reviewed annually using international benchmarks.
Treatment charges per tonne of lead and zinc concentrate decreased in dollar terms by 18.8% and 17.8% respectively compared to 2016.
However this was partly offset by the 2.0% increase in silver refining charges and the increase in volumes of zinc concentrates with high silver contents shipped from Fresnillo and San Julin phase II to MetMex as well as the increased volumes of precipitates sold from San Julin phase I.
As a result treatment and refining charges set out in the income statement decreased by only 0.8% over 2016.

Cost of sales increased 14.1% to US1167.9 million in 2017.
The US144.5 million increase is explained by the following combination of factors An increase in Adjusted production costs US150.3 million.
This was primarily due to i additional Adjusted production costs associated with the increased production US94.7 million ii cost inflation US40.2 million iii increases in the use of consumables services maintenance and others US17.9 million and iv the lower volume of ore processed from development works at Saucito US12.7 million.
The increase was partly offset by the decrease in development works charged to production costs US10.5 million and the positive effect of the 1.5% devaluation of the average Mexican pesoUS dollar spot exchange rate US4.7 million.
Depreciation US21.1 million.
This is due to the additional asset base at San Julin mitigated by lower depreciation at the other operating mines.
Reversal of inventories writedown in 2016 and others US17.5 million.
Profit sharing increased slightly by US1.8 million.
These negative effects were partly offset by Variation in change in work in progress US43.3 million.
This reflected the further decrease in inventories on the leaching pads at Herradura albeit not of the same magnitude as the decrease in 2016.
Mexican pesoUS dollar hedging US2.8 million.
With the Mexican peso exchange rate hedging programme suspended there was no effect in the income statement in 2017 compared to the US2.8 million loss recorded in 2016.
COST PER TONNE CASH COST PER OUNCE AND ALLIN SUSTAINING COST AISC Cost per tonne is a key indicator to measure the effects of mining inflation and cost control performance at each mine.
This indicator is calculated as total production costs plus ordinary mining rights less depreciation profit sharing and exchange rate hedging effects divided by total tonnage processed.
We have included cost per tonne hauledmoved as we believe it is a useful indicator to thoroughly analyse cost performance for the open pit mines.

FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 The particular variations in cash cost for each mine are explained as follows FRESNILLO US0.71OZ  VERSUS US2.09OZ  66.2% The decrease in cash cost per ounce is mainly explained by the higher byproduct credits per silver ounce due to the increase in zinc volumes sold and higher lead and zinc prices US1.60oz lower treatment and refining charges US0.26oz and increase in ore grade US0.07oz.
This was partly offset by higher cost per tonne US0.54oz see page 55.
SAUCITO US1.50OZ  VERSUS  US0.39OZ  NA The increase was driven by the higher cost per tonne US1.69oz see page 56 the expected lower silver grade US0.53 oz and lower byproduct credits per ounce of silver resulting from the decrease in volume of gold sold US0.08oz.
These adverse effects were partly offset by lower treatment and refining charges US0.39oz and lower profit sharing US0.03oz.
CINEGA US163.74OZ  VERSUS  US217.19OZ  NA The increase in cash cost was primarily due to the higher cost per tonne US225.41oz see page 58 and the expected decrease in gold grade US23.81oz.
These unfavourable factors were partly offset by higher byproduct credits per ounce of gold due to the increased volumes of silver and lead sold and higher lead and zinc prices US179.45oz lower treatment and refining charges US13.40oz and lower profit sharing US2.92oz.
HERRADURA US492.86OZ  VERSUS US470.72OZ  4.7% The increase in cash cost resulted from the higher cost per tonne US29.81oz see page 60 the lower gold grade US25.95oz higher profit sharing US0.66oz and lower byproduct credits per gold ounce due to the decreased volume of silver sold at a lower price US0.61oz.
These adverse effects were offset by a favourable inventory valuation effect as ounces with a higher cost of production in the current period are mixed with the initial lower cost of inventory affecting cost of sales US34.76oz and lower treatment and refining charges US0.13oz.
NOCHE BUENA US793.48OZ  VERSUS US765.90OZ  3.6% The increase in cash cost per ounce was mainly due to the favourable effect of the reversal of the writedown of gold inventories on the leaching pads in 2016 which did not occur in 2017 US37.59oz and lower byproduct credits US2.22oz.
This was partly offset by the higher ore grade US6.07oz see page 62 and others US6.17oz.
SAN JULIN PHASE I As operations commenced in August 2016 AISC for 2016 is not considered representative as it corresponds to the startup period when a significant volume of ore from the stock pile was processed.
SAN JULIN PHASE II As operations commenced in July 2017 there are no comparable yearonyear figures.
In addition to the traditional cash cost described above the Group is reporting allin sustaining costs AISC in accordance with the guidelines issued by the World Gold Council.
This cost metric is calculated as traditional cash cost plus onsite general corporate and administrative costs community costs related to current operations capitalised stripping and underground mine development sustaining capital expenditures and remediation expenses.
We consider allin sustaining costs to be a reasonable indicator of a mines ability to generate free cash flow when compared with the corresponding metal price.
We also believe it is a means to monitor not only current production costs but also sustaining costs as it includes mine development costs incurred to prepare the mine for future production as well as sustaining capex.

The US43.3 million increase in gross profit was mainly explained by i the higher profits associated with increased production of US142.9 million ii the US72.3 million estimated benefit of the increase in metal prices and iii the US4.7 million favourable effect of the Mexican pesoUS dollar exchange rate devaluation.
These factors were partly offset by i the lower ore grades mainly at Saucito and Herradura which had an estimated adverse impact of US88.1 million ii cost inflation estimated at US40.2 million and others of US48.3 million.
Herradura and Saucito remained the largest contributors to the Groups consolidated gross profit albeit with a decrease in their gross profit when compared to 2016.
Gross profit at the Fresnillo mine increased by 20.8% over 2016 while the mines contribution to the Groups total gross profit increased to 20.9%.
San Julin was the fourth largest contributor providing 10.1% of total gross profit while Noche Buena and Cinegas share of the Groups total gross profit remained broadly unchanged.
ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Administrative expenses increased 22.9% from US59.1 million to US72.7 million due mainly to additional administrative personnel hired to service a larger number of mines and projects and an increase in services provided by third parties advisors consultants and service providers.
Furthermore increased administrative services provided by Servicios Industriales Peoles de C. the year .

It is calculated as gross profit plus depreciation less administrative selling and exploration expenses.
In 2017 EBITDA increased 2.7% to US1060.1 million mainly due to the higher revenue.
This was partly offset by the higher adjusted production costs exploration and administrative expenses.
However EBITDA margin expressed as a percentage of revenue decreased from 54.2% in 2016 to 50.6% in 2017.
OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSES In 2017 other income and expenses of US16.8 million was recognised in the income statement mainly resulting from the sale of nonstrategic mining claims to Argonaut Gold Inc around its Castillo mine.
This compares favourably against the US9.0 million expense recorded in 2016 which included disposals of fixed assets remediation works and costs incurred in the maintenance of closed mines.
SILVERSTREAM EFFECTS The Silverstream contract is accounted for as a derivative financial instrument carried at fair value.
The revaluation of the Silverstream contract generated a US70.3 million noncash gain mainly as a result of converting resources into reserves at Sabinas and the higher forward price of silver .
In addition a US43.3 million noncash gain was generated by the unwinding of the discounted values and the difference between payments volume and price actually received and accrued in 2017 and payments estimated in the valuation model as at 31 December 2016.
The total effect recorded in the 2017 income statement was a gain of US113.7 million which adversely compares to the US133.5 million gain registered in 2016.

STATEMENTS
Since the IPO cumulative cash received has been US593.0 million while total noncash revaluation gains of US797.4 million have been taken to the income statement.
The Group expects that further unrealised gains or losses will be taken to the income statement in accordance with silver price cyclicality or changes in the variables considered in valuing this contract.
Further information related to the Silverstream contract is provided in the balance sheet section on page 115 and in notes 14 and 30 to the consolidated financial statements.
FINANCE COSTS AND INCOME Finance costs and income in 2017 rose by 3.6% from US32.2 million to US34.0 million mainly due to the decrease in borrowing costs capitalised in 2017 compared to 2016.
In addition a US41.1 million noncash finance loss was generated by the marktomarket time value of the outstanding gold hedging programme which was put in place to protect the investment made in the acquisition of the 44% stake of Newmont in Penmont in 2014.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE A foreign exchange loss of US6.4 million was recorded as a result of the realised transactions in the year and the positive effect of the 4.5% spot revaluation of the Mexican peso against the US dollar on the value of pesodenominated net monetary assets.
This compared favourably against the US18.4 million foreign exchange loss recognised in 2016.
We also enter into certain exchange rate derivative instruments as part of a programme to manage our exposure to foreign exchange risk associated with the purchase of equipment denominated in euro EUR Swedish krona SEK and Canadian dollar
At the end of the year the total EUR SEK and CAD outstanding net forward position was EUR 8.79 million CAD 0.76 million and SEK 32.06 million with maturity dates from March through September 2018.
The volume that expired in 2017 was EUR 9.23 million with a weighted average strike of 1.1368 USEUR and SEK 15.31 million with a weighted average strike of 8.43 SEKUS which has generated a gain of US6532 and US55119 respectively both being recorded in the income statement.
TAXATION
Corporate income tax expense decreased from US260.0 million in 2016 to US153.5 million in 2017 despite the 3.2% increase in profit before income tax.
This decrease resulted mainly from the effect of the 4.5% revaluation of the Mexican pesoUS dollar spot exchange rate in 2017 versus the 20.1% devaluation in 2016 on the tax value of assets and liabilities together with the impact of the higher inflation rate 6.7% in 2017 versus 3.4% in 2016 on the inflationary uplift of the tax base of assets and liabilities.
The effective tax rate excluding the special mining rights was 20.7% which was below the 30% statutory tax rate.
This was mainly due to the tax credit related to the special tax on diesel the inflationary uplift of the assets liabilities and tax losses and the revaluation of the Mexican peso against the US dollar which impacted the carrying amount of assets and liabilities denominated in US dollars and their tax bases denominated in Mexican pesos see note 10 to the financial statements.
Including the effect of the special mining rights the effective tax rate was 24.4% in 2017.
PROFIT FOR THE YEAR Profit for the year increased from US425 million to US560.8 million while profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Group increased to US560.6 million up from US427.0 million in 2016.
Excluding the effects of the Silverstream Contract profit for the year increased from US331.5 million to US481.2 million.
Similarly profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Group excluding the Silverstream effects increased to US481.0 million up from US333.5 million.

FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Cash generated by operations before changes in working capital increased by 4.9% to US1073.7 million mainly as a result of the higher profits generated in the year .
Working capital increased US2.9 million mainly due to an increase in trade and other receivables resulting from the higher volumes sold and the higher gold lead and zinc prices US44.4 million and an increase in prepayments and other assets US0.7 million.
This increase in working capital was partly offset by a decrease in inventories US5.7 million and an increase in trade and other payables US36.4 million.
Taxes and employee profit sharing paid increased 169.4% over 2016 to US309.3 million.
As a result of the above factors net cash from operating activities decreased 15.2% from US898.0 million in 2016 to US761.5 million in 2017.
Other sources of cash were the proceeds of the Silverstream Contract of US43.3 million proceeds from the sale of non strategic assets of US26.1 million and capital contributions from minority shareholders in subsidiaries of US18.9 million.
The above funds were mainly used to purchase property plant and equipment for a total of US604.8 million a 39.3% increase over 2016.
Capital expenditures for 2017 are further described below PURCHASE OF PROPERTY PLANT AND EQUIPMENT US million Fresnillo mine 111.7 Mine development and purchase of inmine equipment and installation of a new zinc thickener and vertical conveyor band Saucito mine 133.7 Development replacement of inmine equipment construction of the Pyrites plant and deepening of the Jarillas shaft Herradura mine 153.2 Stripping activities sustaining capex and construction of second line of DLP San Julin 79.1 Completion of San Julin phase II Cinega mine 46.5 Development replacement of inmine equipment construction of tailings dam and purchase of land Noche Buena 18.7 Mining works and sustaining capex Juanicipio project 34.1 Exploration expenditure and construction of ramps Other 27.7 Total purchase of property plant and equipment 604.8 Dividends paid to shareholders of the Group in 2017 totalled US236.6 million a 168.2% increase from 2016 in line with our dividend policy that includes a consideration of profits generated in the period.
The 2017 payment included the final 2016 dividend of US158.4 million and the 2017 interim dividend paid in September of US78.2 million.
Net interest of US21.0 million was paid mainly reflecting the interest paid in relation with the issuance of the US800 million principal amount of 5.500% Senior Notes.
The sources and uses of funds described above resulted in a decrease in net cash of US16.0 million net decrease in cash and cash equivalents which combined with the US912.0 million balance at the beginning of the year resulted in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of US896.0 million at the end of 2017.

BALANCE SHEET Fresnillo plc continued to maintain a solid financial position with cash and other liquid funds of US896.0 million as of 31 December 2017.
This represented a 1.7% decrease versus December 2016 as explained on the previous page.
Inventories decreased 2.1% to US271.1 million mainly as a result of the further decrease in inventories of gold deposited on the leaching pads at Herradura.
Trade and other receivables increased 40.3% to US402.1 million as a result of the increase in income tax recoverable higher metal volumes sold which increased receivables and an increase in value added tax receivable.
The change in the value of the Silverstream derivative from US467.5 million at the beginning of the year to US538.9 million as of 31 December 2017 reflects proceeds of US42.3 million corresponding to 2017 US37.4 million in cash and US4.9 million in receivables and the Silverstream revaluation effect in the income statement of US113.7 million.
The net book value of property plant and equipment was US2448.6 million at year end representing a 12.3% increase over 2016.
The US268.4 million increase was mainly due to the larger asset base following the commissioning of San Julin capitalised development works construction of the Pyrites plant and the second DLP line purchase of additional inmine equipment and the construction of leaching pads at Herradura and Noche Buena.
The Groups total equity was US3066.6 million as of 31 December 2017 a 12.9% increase over 2016.
This was mainly explained by the increase in retained earnings reflecting the 2016 profit lower dividends paid during the year and the net unrealised gains on cash flow hedges.
DIVIDENDS
Based on the Groups 2017 performance the Directors have recommended a final dividend of US29.8 cents per Ordinary Share which will be paid on 4 June 2018 to shareholders on the register on 27 April 2018.
The dividend will be paid in UK pounds sterling unless shareholders elect to be paid in US dollars.
This is in addition to the interim dividend of US10.6 cents per share totalling US78.1 million.

DEAR SHAREHOLDER During 2017 stakeholder expectations for good corporate governance have continued to evolve both in the UK and Mexico.
My Board colleagues and I have sought to understand the implications of those developments for Fresnillo plc and respond to them accordingly.
In Mexico there was a significant development in antibribery and corruption legislation during the year .
It was pleasing from the Boards perspective to see that the work we have undertaken over the past few years to ensure compliance with the UK Bribery Act enabled us to accommodate the requirements of the new Mexican legislation very easily.
Nevertheless this provided us as a Board with the opportunity to review and update our Group Code of Ethics and AntiBribery and Corruption policy.
We have also continued to monitor the work being undertaken by the management team to understand and develop our corporate culture which will help us as we engage with our employees and the communities in which we operate.
In 2017 we were required to resubmit our executive remuneration policy to shareholders for approval at the
I am delighted that again over 99% of our independent shareholders supported the remuneration policy.
We note that our policy is unusual in some respects compared to many companies in the FTSE 100 index because our approach to executive remuneration seeks to align with Mexican market practice.
The Remuneration Committee continues to review investor expectations and will continue to provide good explanations for those aspects where we differ from the norm in our Remuneration Report see pages 152161.
Ahead of the 2017 Annual General Meeting we engaged in a number of conversations with institutional investors and their representative bodies about our Board composition and membership recognising the need to evolve the independent representation on the Board and ensure that our Directors have sufficient time to be able to commit to the work of the Board.
During the second half of 2017 we continued to consider the evolution of the Board and as a result we recently announced some further changes to the Board which will take effect from the 2018 AGM.
I am delighted that Dame Judith Macgregor joined the Board as an independent Nonexecutive Director following the AGM.
Dame Judith brings a range of perspectives to the Board and we will benefit from her diplomatic experience particularly gained during her four years as the British Ambassador to Mexico.
It is also proposed that Georgina Kessel will join our Board after the 2018 AGM.
These two appointments mean that 50% of the new appointments to the Fresnillo plc Board in the past six years will have been female demonstrating our commitment to broaden the diversity of our Board.
The Nominations Committee continues to be mindful that Fresnillo plc does not yet meet the current expectations for gender diversity on FTSE 100 boards and will continue its efforts to address this in its future Board appointments.
Guy Wilson the Chairman of our Audit Committee has now served on the Board for nine years.
In keeping with the UK Corporate Governance Code requirements on director independence it will no longer be possible for Guy to remain on the Board as an independent Nonexecutive Director and Audit Committee Chairman.
It is therefore with great regret that Guy will step down from the Board after the 2018 AGM.
We will continue to speak to our institutional investors and other counterparties concerning our approach to corporate governance in order to ensure that we communicate our perspective on governance within our Mexican context while at the same time responding to any questions or concerns that shareholders may have about our governance standards.
As we approach the tenth anniversary of our listing on the London Stock Exchange we remain committed to the standards of good governance set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code which we will endeavour to apply in the way that we believe best serves the interests of all of our stakeholders.

The Executive Committee comprises the most senior executives within the Fresnillo Group.
FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 FRESNILLO AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Board takes corporate governance seriously and considers its responsibilities under the UK Corporate Governance Code the Code with care.
With nearly 75% of its share capital owned by Peoles it is important to consider corporate governance in the context of the Companys relationship with its parent company.
The Board considers this to be a strength rather than a threat because it brings the shareholder perspective into the boardroom and creates an additional level of accountability for the executive team compared to other listed companies.
The framework for corporate governance within Fresnillo plc therefore has three features which are relatively unusual for UK public companies in particular There are no Executive Directors on the Board however the Fresnillo Board operates differently from the traditional UK board with Nonexecutive and Executive Directors.
The nonindependent and independent Directors on the Board engage with the business of the Board in slightly different ways.
The nonindependent Directors have more regular daytoday access to the executive management of Fresnillo plc within the Peoles context and therefore are able to engage with proposals put forward by the Executive Committee in a more direct manner .
The independent Nonexecutive Directors bring an external perspective to bear when evaluating proposals and conducting the business of the Board.
Thus the nonindependent Directors the independent Nonexecutive Directors and the Executive Committee have complementary roles in the business of the Board.
The membership of the Remuneration Committee is made up of Nonexecutive Directors the majority of whom are independent who are able to bring the following perspectives to the working of the Remuneration Committee an understanding of shareholder expectations an understanding of the evolving remuneration expectations of investors on the London Stock Exchange and an understanding of the general approaches to remuneration within the Mexican market.
In addition given the Companys London premium listing and most of the remuneration requirements being internationally driven the Nomination Committee and Board are of the view that Charles Jacobs based in London is the most appropriate chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
Having the Chairman who is nonexecutive but not independent as a member of the Remuneration Committee enhances the Committees collective ability to take these perspectives into account in its discussions.
Fresnillo plc derives synergistic benefits from services provided by Peoles.
Being a part of a group which has common requirements across a number of service areas provides opportunities for resources to be shared efficiently from a cost point of view.
The Audit Committee has therefore developed governance processes to ensure that these arrangements provide the intended benefits to the Company in a transparent and controlled manner .
The key elements of the Boards approach to ensuring that the Companys commercial relationship with its parent company and other related parties are independent and maintained on an arms length basis are described later in this section.
UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE COMPLIANCE STATEMENT As a company with a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange Fresnillo is required under the FCA Listing Rules to comply with the Code Provisions of the Code a copy of which can be found on the website of the Financial Reporting Council www. rc. or otherwise explain its reasons for noncompliance.
The following statement is therefore made in respect of the year ended 31 December 2017 in compliance with such requirement.
For the financial year ended 31 December 2017 the Company has complied with the provisions of the Code in all areas save in respect of two instances.
Code Provision D.1.1 provides that the Remuneration Committee should include provisions that would enable the Company to recover sums paid or withhold the payment of any sum to senior executives and specify the circumstances in which it would be appropriate to do so.
Following the approval by shareholders of the Companys Remuneration Policy at the 2017 AGM on 23 May 2017 the Remuneration Committee now has discretion to reduce annual bonus payments where circumstances justify it.
Thus the Board considers that the Company was in compliance with Code Provision D.1.1 with effect from the date of approval of the new Directors Remuneration Policy.
Further explanation is set out in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 165.
Code Provision D.2.1 provides that the Board should establish a Remuneration Committee of at least three independent Nonexecutive Directors.
The composition of the Fresnillo Remuneration Committee is made up of three members including two independent Non executive Directors one of whom Charles Jacobs is the Chairman of the Committee.
The Chairman of the Company Alberto Baillres who was not independent at the time of his appointment is also a member .
The Board believes that Mr Baillres experience and knowledge of the Group and the Mexican market and his considerable contribution to the Remuneration Committees deliberations justifies his membership of the Remuneration Committee.
Mr Baillres is not involved in matters concerning his own remuneration.
The following sections of this report explain how the principles of the Code were applied and provide cross references to other sections of the report andor the Companys website site where more detailed descriptions are available.

THE GOVERNANCE OF FRESNILLOS RELATED PARTY ARRANGEMENTS RELATIONSHIP AGREEMENT Peoles has entered into a relationship agreement with the Company the Relationship Agreement to ensure that relationships between the Fresnillo Group and the Peoles Group are conducted at arms length and on normal commercial terms.
The nonindependent Directors listed previously have been appointed to the Board by Peoles pursuant to the Relationship Agreement.
The Relationship Agreement complies with the independence provisions set out in Listing Rule 6.1.4DR for controlled companies.
The Company has complied with the independence provisions included in the Relationship Agreement during the financial year ended 31 December 2017.
As far as the Company is aware such provisions have been complied with during the financial year ended 31 December 2017 by Peoles andor any of its associates.
Peoles has also undertaken not to exercise its voting rights to amend the Articles of Association in a way which would be inconsistent with the provisions of the agreement.
It has also agreed to abstain from voting on any resolution to approve a related party transaction as defined in paragraph 11.1.5 R of the Listing Rules involving any member of the Peoles Group.
The following diagram summarises the approach taken to identify and manage related party transactions.

TRANSACTION
HOW THIS IS MANAGED If a Director is interested in a company which could potentially enter into transactions with a Fresnillo plc Group company the Board will normally consider that interest under its arrangements for authorising conflicts of interest under s175 of Companies Act.
HOW THIS IS MANAGED The Executive Committee will seek to ensure that the best possible terms are achieved for a proposed transaction and that they are verified by industry benchmarking reports or independent valuationassessment where possible.
HOW THIS IS MANAGED The Audit Committee reviews the key terms of major transactions which are verified as to price and quality with external consultants or independent benchmarking where possible.
HOW THIS IS MANAGED Under the Relationship Agreement and the Listing Rules the Independent Directors must approve any transaction with the Peoles Group and its associates without the nonindependent Directors voting.
Ongoing monitoring of Directors interests and related parties of the Company provides the information to determine if a related party approval is required for a proposed transaction where possible.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The Group requires that Directors complete a Directors List.
The list sets out details of situations where each Directors interest may conflict with those of the Company situational conflicts.
Each Director has resubmitted their list as at 31 December 2017 for the Board to consider and authorise any new situational conflicts identified in the resubmitted lists.
At the beginning of each Board meeting the Company Secretary reminds the Directors of their duties under sections 175 177 and 182 of the Companies Act which relate to the disclosure of any conflicts of interest prior to any matter that may be discussed by the Board.
Further information about related party matters considered by the Board during the year are set out in the Audit Committee Report on page 144.
FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 BOARD LEADERSHIP AND EFFECTIVENESS BOARD COMPOSITION As at the date of this Report the Board consists of a Nonexecutive Chairman seven Nonexecutive Directors that it considers to be independent and four Nonexecutive Directors not considered to be independent.
There are no Directors who have executive responsibilities within the Company.
BOARD ROLES The requirements of the roles of Chairman and of the Chief Executive Officer have been agreed by the Board and are set out in a written Statement of Responsibilities.
Octavio Alvdrez the Chief Executive Officer is not currently a member of the Board.
Charles Jacobs the Senior Independent Director is available to shareholders if they have concerns that have not been resolved through the normal channels of Chairman Chief Executive Officer Chief Financial Officer or Head of Investor Relations.
The composition of the Board has been structured to ensure that no one individual can dominate the decisionmaking processes of the Board.
CHAIRMANS INDEPENDENCE The Chairman Mr Baillres is beneficially interested in more than 50% of the share capital of the Company through his interest in Industrias Peoles S. de C. the Companys controlling shareholder .
Mr Baillres is also the Chairman of Peoles and other companies within the BAL Group.
Mr Baillres was appointed to the Board by Peoles pursuant to the Relationship Agreement thus at the time of his appointment was not independent.
Having been responsible for overseeing the successful development of the Group over many years the Board considers that his continued involvement as its Nonexecutive Chairman is very important to the continued success of the Company.
The Relationship Agreement continues to provide a transparent governance system which ensures that the Company benefits from Mr Baillres leadership and experience while being able to demonstrate to other shareholders that the Fresnillo Group is capable of carrying on its business independently.
In particular the Relationship Agreement ensures that transactions and relationships between the Fresnillo Group and its controlling shareholder are at arms length and on competitive commercial terms.
Further information regarding the Relationship Agreement can be found on pages 123 and 144.
INDEPENDENCE
The Board considers the Directors listed as being independent on pages 119 and 120 to be independent in character and judgement.
For each of these Directors their circumstances are assessed by reference to Provision B.1.1. account.
In making this assessment the Board has taken the following considerations into account Charles Jacobs Charles Jacobs is the worldwide senior partner and chairman of Linklaters LLP .
Mr Jacobs is not involved in the provision of legal or any other services to the Company by Linklaters LLP .
Linklaters LLP is currently one of the Companys legal advisers where any such advice is limited to English law and is provided by a different partner of Linklaters LLP .
Selection of legal advisers is not a Board matter and is decided at the management level.
None of the Fresnillo management sit on the Board.
However if any decision were to be made at the Board level regarding Linklaters LLP which has not happened to date Mr Jacobs would excuse himself in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 relating to Directors interests.
Mr Jacobs does not have and has not had within the last three years a material business relationship with the Company either directly or as a partner shareholder director or senior employee of a body that has such a relationship with the Company.
By way of illustration the legal fees paid to Linklaters LLP for the last three financial years were 177k for the year ended 31 December 2015 148k for the year ended 31 December 2016 and 117k for the year ended 31 December 2017.
Thus in each year the fees paid to Linklaters represented less than 0.01% of Linklaters global earnings and less than 0.01% of the Companys global revenues.
The Audit Committee reviews the appropriateness of all professional advisers fees each year including legal fees as part of their review of ordinary course of business expenses.

Group.
Given that he is not involved in executive duties in any of those companies and has a similar obligation to be independent for those two companies as for Fresnillo the Board does not consider that Mr Ruiz position as an independent Nonexecutive Director of the Company is adversely impacted by those two appointments.
Fernando Ruiz breadth of knowledge and experience across a wide range of Mexican businesses together with the invaluable audit and tax experience he brings to the role are highly regarded by the Board.
Notwithstanding his length of service on the Board the Board is satisfied that he continues to demonstrate the qualities of independence and objectivity in carrying out his role as a Nonexecutive Director .
Jaime Serra No issues to consider .
Alberto Tiburcio Alberto Tiburcio retired as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Mancera S. the Mexican firm of EY the Companys auditors in June 2013.
Mr Tiburcio was not involved in the provision of audit or any other services to the Company by Ernst and Young LLP prior to his retirement.
Mr Tiburcio is an independent nonexecutive director of Grupo Nacional Provincial and Profuturo Afore S. de C. which are companies within the BAL Group.
Given that he is not involved in executive duties in any of those companies and has a similar obligation to be independent for those two companies as for Fresnillo the Board does not consider that Mr Tiburcios position as an independent Nonexecutive Director of the Company is adversely impacted by those two appointments.
Guy Wilson Guy Wilson retired as a partner of Ernst and Young LLP the Companys auditor in 2008.
Mr Wilson was not involved in the provision of audit or any other services to the Company by Ernst and Young LLP prior to his retirement.
COMMITMENT
The Nominations Committee annually reviews the time commitments of the Nonexecutive Directors to the Fresnillo plc Board.
Its philosophy in doing so is that the total workload of the Nonexecutive Director should be taken into consideration.
For those Directors who do not have a fulltime job elsewhere the availability of time is different to those that do.
The Board benefits from the experience of those Directors as well as from their other interests.
This is considered to be a strength.
Furthermore public companies vary considerably in the expectations that they place on their nonexecutive directors.
A global company with various lines of business operating in many countries should not count the same as a singleproduct company with operations primarily in just one country.
Fresnillo plc falls into the latter category and because of the relative simplicity of its activities the Board does not consider that it needs more than four scheduled Board meetings a year a factor which is reflected in the relatively low fees that the Company pays its Nonexecutive Directors.
This relatively low number of meetings is further justified by the degree of governance oversight of the Company which comes by virtue of it being also a member of the BAL Group of which five of its Nonexecutive Directors are also members.
The Nonexecutive Directors are required by their letters of appointment to spend 14 days per annum on Company business.
The BAL Group Directors usually meet with management prior to each Board meeting to extensively review the agenda and papers for the forthcoming meeting with them.
They also oversee management responses to actions arising from the Board meetings.
This time commitment as well as the time required in travelling to the UK for the annual general meeting each year significantly exceeds the time commitment specified in their letters of appointment.
The independent Directors have committee responsibilities which in conjunction with their Board duties take up more time than their letters or appointment require.
In addition the UKbased Directors also travel to and from Mexico for Board and Committee meetings which also significantly increases the time that they spend on their Board duties.
OVERBOARDING
During the year the Company engaged specifically with shareholders and voting agencies on the subject of perceived overboarding on the part of some of the Board members.
Board members have discussed this issue both formally and informally during the year and their perspective on this matter is underpinned by two generic factors which may not always be apparent to shareholders 1 A number of directors hold nonexecutive roles within companies listed in Mexico.
Mexican listed companies generally operate with large boards with the option for alternate directors to be appointed and generally lower expectations on the time and commitment required from their nonexecutive directors.
The Board estimates that the time commitment for board and committee meetings at a Mexican company is between a third and a quarter of the time required at a UK plc.
FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 BOARD LEADERSHIP AND EFFECTIVENESS
2 The calendar for Board and Committee meetings is scheduled to align with all of the other meetings of companies including listed companies within the BAL Group ownership structure.
This ensures that Fresnillo plc Directors who are appointed to the boards of other companies within the BAL Group do not have any time conflicts with their other commitments on BAL Listed Entity boards.
The near full attendance record of the nonindependent Nonexecutive Directors over the ten years since the Companys IPO bears this out.
The other listed company directorships of the Fresnillo plc directors is set out on pages 118 to 120 of this report.

The schedule is annually reviewed to keep it up to date with any regulatory developments.
The last review and revision was undertaken in October 2017.
All meetings of the Board are held in Mexico.
The Board has a wellestablished programme of meetings.
Board members usually receive Board papers five days prior to meetings in order to enable the Directors adequate time to study and consider the documents.
Members of the Executive Committee led by the Chief Executive Officer are present at all of the Board meetings and present all of the papers on operational and financial matters.
Directors have the right to raise concerns at Board meetings and can ask for those concerns to be recorded in the Board minutes.
The advice and services of the Company Secretary whose appointment and removal is a matter reserved for the Board are also available to the Directors.
The Group has also established a procedure which enables in relevant circumstances Directors to obtain independent professional advice at the Companys expense.

It serves to complement the internal and external regulations already in force and also to establish corrective measures for anyone who fails to comply with the provisions of the Code.
It also provides the framework for the Companys compliance with the UK Bribery Act and the Mexican antibribery and corruption legislation.
Changes to the Code of Conduct were ratified by the Board in February 2017 the objective of these changes was to incorporate a behavioural compass establishing basic questions that personnel should ask themselves before making decisions highlight the corporate values address topics such as money laundering and industrial espionage emphasise that safety is a top priority and give greater clarity on sanctions in the case of violations.

BOARD PERFORMANCE EVALUATION In order to evaluate its own effectiveness the Board undertakes annual appraisals using a combination of externally facilitated and internallyrun evaluations over a threeyear cycle.
The cycle of the Boards evaluations is summarised as follows YEAR 1 Externally facilitated Board evaluation using questionnaires andor interviews YEAR 2 Followup on action plan prepared in response to year 1 evaluation using internallyfacilitated questionnaires YEAR 3 Focus on outstanding and emerging issues arising from the action plan using internallyfacilitated questionnaires BOARD EVALUATION IN 2017 At the beginning of 2017 the Board considered an action plan in response to the findings of the internallyfacilitated evaluation undertaken in 2016 being the final step in the previous threeyear cycle.
In 2017 Fresnillo engaged Lintstock to facilitate an evaluation of the performance of the Board of Directors.
Lintstock is an advisory firm that specialises in Board performance reviews and has no other connection with the Company.
The first stage of the review involved Lintstock engaging with the key project sponsors including Executive Committee and Nonexecutive Board members to set the context for the evaluation and to tailor survey content to the specific circumstances of Fresnillo.
All Board members were then requested to complete an online survey addressing the performance of the Board and its Committees.
The anonymity of the respondents was ensured throughout the process in order to promote an open and frank exchange of views.
Lintstock subsequently produced a report addressing the following areas of Board performance The appropriateness of the Boards composition was assessed and respondents were asked to identify any additional competencies from which the Board would benefit.
The Boards understanding of the views of key stakeholders and the markets in which the Company operates was considered.
The Boards oversight of the culture and behaviours throughout the organisation was also reviewed.
The relationships between Board members and management and the atmosphere in and management of meetings were assessed as was the quality of the Board packs and management presentations at meetings.
The effectiveness of the Board in reviewing the Companys current performance and influencing future performance was considered and respondents were asked to identify areas upon which they feel the Board should spend more or less time focusing.
The Boards oversight of strategy and the Companys progress against its strategic pillars was considered as was the Boards understanding of the capacity of the organisation to deliver the strategy.
Respondents views as to the top strategic issues facing the Company were also identified.
The Boards oversight of risk management was assessed as was the Boards effectiveness in monitoring the Companys health and safety performance.
The appropriateness of the structure of the Company at senior levels was reviewed and the level of interaction between the Board and top management in various settings was considered.
As a result of the review among other things the Board agreed to the following key actions KEY FINDINGS FROM 2017 EVALUATION PROPOSED ACTIONS More time should be devoted to strategy In future there will be one general strategy discussion a year and specific strategy discussions e. safety or exploration at each other meeting during the year .
More time should be allocated to succession planning A formal Board discussion of the succession plan will be scheduled once a year .
INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS Nonexecutive Directors occasionally meet the Chairman without executives being present.
The independent Nonexecutive Directors meet annually in order to evaluate the performance of the Chairman.
On the back of this meeting the Senior Independent Director discusses the views of the independent Directors with the Chairman.
The Independent Directors held this meeting in 2017 after the February meeting and took the 2016 Board Evaluation review into account in their discussions and feedback to the Chairman.

STATEMENTS
DEAR SHAREHOLDER In my letter as Chairman of the Nominations Committee in the 2016 Annual Report I stated that we remain strongly committed to the principle of equality of opportunity when considering new appointments to the Board.
Shortly after the publication of that report we were delighted to announce that Dame Judith Macgregor would be joining the Board with effect from the 2017 AGM.
Dame Judith has now joined the Board and is adding useful counsel and insight to our discussions.
I am equally delighted that we propose to appoint Georgina Kessel to the Board following the 2018 AGM bringing the proportion of women on our Board to 25% compared to less than 10% just over a year ago.
Our policy is to make appointments to the Board on the basis of merit and there can be no doubt that we have kept to our policy in making both of these appointments.
The Nominations Committee remains mindful that we are in a phase during which careful consideration of the composition of the Board is required particularly as some of our independent Nonexecutive Directors reach the ninth anniversary of their appointment.
We have therefore made changes to the composition of the Board and its Committees to retain the right number of independent Nonexecutive Directors on our Board and meet the standards set by the UK Corporate Governance Code.
As a Committee we are also keen to ensure that our current Board members are committing appropriate amounts of time and effort to the Boards work and have scrutinised the other commitments and attendance record of our Directors very carefully.
We are aware that two of our Board members hold more external directorships than some of our stakeholders would prefer and levels of attendance at Board and Committee meetings also come under scrutiny.
We are delighted that our Board is made up of very talented and expert Directors and the contribution of each one both in and outside of Board meetings is valued.
Each year we monitor the contribution of our Directors and in 2017 we had the additional assurance provided by our externally facilitated Board and Committee evaluation exercise to support our views on this point.
At present the North America Free Trade Agreement which is of critical importance to Mexico is coming under increasing scrutiny and one of our Directors Jaime Serra who was key to its original introduction is for a while in demand because of his expertise in this area.
We are pleased that he is actively contributing to this important development for Mexico and are happy to accept that this meant that he just missed one Board meeting as a consequence.
During the year the membership of the Nominations Committee changed with Fernando Ruiz standing down from the Committee following the Companys AGM in May and being replaced by Alberto Tiburcio an independent Nonexecutive Director .
I would like to place on record my thanks to Fernando for his contribution to the Committee since its formation in 2008 and I am pleased to welcome Alberto to the Committee in his place.
Yours faithfully Mr Alberto Baillres Chairman of the Nominations Committee NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE REPORT 132 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE REPORT
MEMBERSHIP
The members of the Nominations Committee are Alberto Baillres Chairman of the Committee Brbara Garza Lagera and Alberto Tiburcio.
Mr Tiburcio was appointed as a member of the Nominations Committee on 23 May 2017 replacing Fernando
The majority of the members of the Nominations Committee are therefore independent Nonexecutive Directors.
ROLE
The Nominations Committee is responsible for making recommendations to the Board on the structure size and composition of the Board and its committees and succession planning for the Directors and other senior executives.
Before making appointments of new Directors the Committee is responsible for evaluating the balance of skills knowledge and experience on the Board and identifying and nominating suitable candidates.
The Nominations Committee has approved Board Appointments and Board Diversity Policies which provide the framework for the Nominations Committee and the Boards approach to Board appointments.

The Nominations Committee continues to consider the composition of the Board with a focus on its continued commitment to diversity.
The criteria for determining the composition of the Board and future Board appointments continue to be based on Relationship Agreement requirements for appointments to the Board by Peoles.
The Companys leading position as a precious metals miner in Mexico.
The Companys inclusion in the FTSE 100 Index.
The specific functions on Board committees which independent Directors will be required to fulfil.
The provisions set out in the current terms of reference of the Nominations Committee.
The Nominations Committee does not use open advertising or retain any external consultants when making new appointments to the Board as it is considered unnecessary considering the Companys contacts within Mexico and further afield.
BOARD DIVERSITY POLICY IN SUMMARY AND PROGRESS All Board appointments are made on merit.
The Board recognises and embraces the benefits of having a diverse Board particularly the value that different perspectives and experience bring to the quality of Board debate and decisionmaking.
There are certain considerations which are taken into account in considering the composition of the Board such as background and experience age gender and shareholder perspectives.
The Board believes that setting targets for the number of people from a particular background or gender is not the most effective approach to take.
The Board will therefore look to follow the principles of this policy rather than specified quotas or targets.
Following the appointment of Dame Judith Macgregor as an independent Nonexecutive Director during the year three of the seven new Directors that have been appointed to the Board since 2012 have been women.
This demonstrates the Boards commitment to gender diversity.
With 16.6% of the current Board composition being female the Nominations Committee recognises that this does not meet the 33% target for representation of women on the board set by the Hampton 133 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

Alexander Review.
Nevertheless it will continue to keep the gender balance of the Board as a key factor in considering future Board appointments which at all times will be based on merit.
The Board recognises that very few women are attracted to mining engineering and geology academic programmes in Mexico and in view of the stage of development of Mexico the participation of women in the labour force as a whole is still relatively low.
This will take time to rectify but it is changing and the Company is committed to hiring and developing women with educational training in mining engineering geology finance and accounting.
With nine Mexican and three British directors on the Board the Nominations Committee is satisfied with the ethnic diversity of the Board.
Full versions of the Board Appointments Policy and Process and the Board Diversity Policy and the Group Diversity Policy can be found on the Companys website site.
ACTIVITY DURING 2017 The Nominations Committee met twice during the year .
BOARD APPOINTMENTS The Nominations Committee is committed to a progressive refreshing of the Board as recommended by Code Provision B.2.3 of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Following departures from the Board in 2016 the Nominations Committee led by the Chairman considered options for the appointment of a new independent Nonexecutive Director at its meetings in February and April 2017.
In making its recommendation that Dame Judith Macgregor be appointed to the Board the Nominations Committee recognised that Dame Judiths impressive credentials as a diplomat including four years as the British Ambassador to Mexico would bring a new and valuable perspective to the Boards work.
The Nominations Committee recognises that further independent Nonexecutive Director appointments are necessary as some of the current independent Directors reach the nineyear deadline for independence set by the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Consequently Mr Guy Wilson will step down from the Board at the 2018 AGM and subject to shareholder approval at the same meeting be replaced as an independent Nonexecutive Director by Georgina Kessel.
COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP The Nominations Committee reviewed the composition and effectiveness of the Board Committees in 2017 and while it was satisfied that the Committees are working well it also considered that the membership of the Committees would need to be refreshed in order to ensure that they clearly reflect the appropriate representation of independent Nonexecutive Directors on each Committee.
The Nominations Committee therefore approved the following changes to the Board Committees in April 2017 Alberto Tiburcio was appointed to the Nominations Committee in place of Fernando Ruiz Jaime Serra Puche was appointed to the Remuneration Committee in place of Mr Ruiz and Mr Ruiz left the Audit Committee and was appointed a member of the HSECR Committee.
EXECUTIVE SUCCESSION PLANNING Each year the Nominations Committee reviews a schedule of possible successors for all the positions on the Executive Committee Chief Executive Officer Chief Financial Officer Vice President of Exploration and Chief Operating Officer.
This review considers both shortterm emergency and longterm planning scenarios.
Any actions needed to support the development of potential longterm successors are discussed.
The Nominations Committee also monitors the longterm evolution of the membership of the Board as a whole.
These matters were all discussed by the Nominations Committee in 2017 and it is satisfied with the actions that are being taken to support this.
OTHER NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE ACTIVITY The Nominations Committee also considered the following matters Approval of the Nominations Committee Report prior to publication.
Review of the time commitment required from each Director .
The proposed reelection of each of the continuing Directors at the AGM.
A selfevaluation exercise which concluded that the Nominations Committee is functioning well.
The terms of reference of the Nominations Committee are available on the Companys website at site The letters of appointment for the Nonexecutive Directors are made available for inspection at the Companys registered office during normal business hours.
FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT DEAR SHAREHOLDER In additional to our normal duties which are set out in the following Report we have been addressing three issues which arose in 2017 namely new accounting standards the NonFinancial Reporting Directive and the increasing activities of the Mexican tax authorities.
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Management has modelled the effects of IFRS 9  Financial Instruments and IFRS 15  Revenue from contracts with customers.
The results indicate that the financial effects on our Group financial statements of IFRS 15 are likely to be minimal.
The effect of IFRS 9 is estimated to be an initial adjustment from retained earnings to hedging reserves as at 1 January 2017 of US23.0 million and an adjustment decreasing financial costs for the year ended 31 December 2017 of US42.1 million.
THE NONFINANCIAL REPORTING DIRECTIVE We have been monitoring managements actions to assemble the information required using Internal Audit to validate the data extracted from our operational records.
We have also taken into consideration section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 to ensure that the resulting information is properly presented.
TAXATION
During 2017 the Mexican tax authorities have opened a number of investigations into the tax returns of our subsidiaries some of them going back several years.
These investigations are considered to be routine but the level of activity appears to have increased.
These investigations cover three main areas.
The normal reviews instigated by our recognised trade union seeking to ensure that PTU the statutory employee profitsharing arrangement which is available to all Mexican employees has been correctly calculated.
Reviews looking at certain of our subsidiaries tax returns for the year 2013 which reflect the corporate reconstruction of our mining operations.
The tax inspections have been relatively straightforward so far in that activity has been limited to requests for information which we have promptly supplied by the due dates.
In addition new legislation required us to obtain details of the tax compliance of certain contractors to whom we made payments.
We are working with our suppliers to ensure that full information is provided to the tax authorities.
So far this is working well but it did consume a significant amount of time and resources in 2017 prior to the online portal to input this information to the tax authorities opening in 2018.
In all of the above we are confident that no material tax costs or penalties will arise and therefore we do not consider that potential tax exposure in relation to the above matters is a significant issue for the financial statements for 2017 as reflected in note 10 to the financial statements but we will continue to monitor the situation closely.
AUDIT COMMITTEE EVALUATION In the latter part of 2017 Lintstock an independent advisory firm carried out an evaluation of us using a questionnairebased approach which indicated that we were doing an effective job.
Nevertheless we have done our own evaluation to identify a few areas of focus for 2018 which are set out in the Effectiveness section of this Report.
SAN JULIN During the year I and two of my fellow Directors had the opportunity to visit San Julin which is the first time I have visited a new mine.
It is an amazing sight to see when after flying over an impressive mountain range for some time you see a transformed valley below.
As it is a new mine you can see how the mine commenced and from the plans you can see its logical development over time.
The accommodation community centre and recreational facilities are excellent and we also had a chance to see how the Company works positively with the local community.
All in all it is a visit that I will remember for a long time as the whole operation is a credit to the hard work of the development team to have completed such a large project in a remote location in a relatively short time and on budget.

SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENT AREAS The Audit Committee spends time ensuring that there is consistency between the policies and judgements used in preparing both the fullyear and halfyear financial statements prior to respectively recommending those financial statements to the Board for approval.
In conjunction with management and the external auditor the Audit Committee considers the principal areas of audit risk and judgements made in relation to the financial statements which should be considered during its review of the financial statements and the external auditors report thereon.
In many cases these significant judgement areas will be the same as those considered in previous years however as the mining cycle progresses these judgement areas will evolve and new ones will need to be considered while others may become less important.

CONCLUSION ON SUITABILITY OF
SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENT AREAS IN 2017 The significant judgement areas prioritised in 2017 are set out below.
In each case the Audit Committee concluded that the accounting treatment and disclosure in the financial statements is appropriate.
MINERAL RESERVES AND RESOURCES SEE PAGES 274 TO 278 ASSESSMENT OF THE RISK Reserves and resources are a primary driver of Fresnillos market valuation and a significant input into calculations of depreciation and assessments of impairment.
Inaccuracies in the estimation of reserves and resources would lead to broad implications across the Annual Report and Accounts.
VARIABLES CONSIDERED The estimation of mineral reserves and resources requires significant judgement not only in respect of mineral physically in place but also metal price and cost assumptions used to determine the cutoff grade for identifying economically viable ore bodies.
There is also judgment in developing and maintaining the mine plans which estimate the timing and quantities of related production.
SOURCES OF ASSURANCE The Audit Committee reviewed the report by SRK Consulting the Companys independent reserves and resources auditor on the reserves and resources excluding Silverstream and considered the yearonyear changes in SRKs estimation of reserves and resources quantities.
The Audit Committee also considered EYs evaluation of the competence and objectivity of SRK in the context of financial reporting.

FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
SILVERSTREAM CONTRACT SEE NOTE 14 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ASSESSMENT OF THE RISK The Silverstream contract represents a large asset on our balance sheet which can as a result of movements in variables discussed below give rise to large albeit non cash income or expense amounts in our income statement.
VARIABLES CONSIDERED The Silverstream contract is a derivative financial instrument which must be reflected at fair value at each balance sheet date.
The fair value is most sensitive to the timing and volume of forecast production derived from the reserves and resources and production profile of the Sabinas mine estimated future silver price and the discount rate applied in the valuation.
SOURCES OF ASSURANCE The Audit Committee reviewed the inputs into the estimation of the valuation at the balance sheet date and associated sensitivity analysis.
This included managements consideration of a review of the Peoles reserve and resource estimation process performed by SRK in the year that had been commissioned by Peoles and the disclosures relating to the Silverstream contract.
It discussed with EY their procedures for their audit of the valuation and the key assumptions therein.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS INCLUDING REVENUE RECOGNITION SEE NOTE 27 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ASSESSMENT OF THE RISK Fresnillo has a controlling shareholder and as a result has very strong ties both to Peoles and the broader BAL group.
There is a risk that related party relationships could be taken advantage of to manipulate earnings or otherwise distort our financial position.
Furthermore related party transaction disclosure requirements allow investors to understand the Companys exposure to inappropriate related party transactions and there is a risk that disclosures in our financial statements could be inaccurate or incomplete.
VARIABLES CONSIDERED Every year the Audit Committee scrutinises the probity of all major related party transactions to ensure that they are entered into transparently and fairly to all shareholders see the section of this report headed Transactions with Related Parties.
The Audit Committee has also considered transfer pricing assessments completed by the Groups external adviser PricewaterhouseCoopers.
SOURCES OF ASSURANCE The Audit Committee reviewed EYs procedures to ensure that related party transactions are recognised accurately and correctly reported in the relevant disclosures in the Annual Report to ensure that they are consistent with the information it is presented with during the year .
TAXATION AND PTU SEE NOTE 10 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ASSESSMENT OF THE RISK The taxation of mining companies in Mexico has been the subject of much attention and governmental action in Mexico.
In accordance with the Mexican legislation local companies also pay employee profit sharing PTU equivalent to approximately 10% of the taxable income of each fiscal year .
There is a risk that deductions taken when calculating tax and PTU charges may be challenged and that any resulting exposures to payable taxation and PTU may not have been provided for appropriately.
In addition certain tax assets and liabilities are denominated in Mexican pesos and may be revalued during the period resulting in foreign exchange gains or losses which need to be taken into account when assessing the tax charge for the period.
VARIABLES CONSIDERED The Audit Committee seeks to conclude that the stated charges for PTU and taxation are fair and reasonable.
It reviews all the significant judgements and adjustments applied to accounting profit in determining profit subject to taxation or PTU for each subsidiary which are clearly set out in papers prepared by management.
SOURCES OF ASSURANCE Throughout the year the Audit Committee received updates on the status of tax inspections and the Companys progress in meeting the new legislation with respect to contractors tax compliance.
The Audit Committee also challenged managements detailed memorandum and sought EYs views and ascertained the degree to which such judgements and adjustments are supported by internal andor external subject matter experts and ensured that these explanations correspond with information it was presented with during the year prior to approving the relevant disclosures in the Annual Report.
FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
FINANCIAL REPORTING CONTINUED LICENCES AND LAND TITLE SEE NOTE 12 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ASSESSMENT OF THE RISK Without good title to land and licences to operate the Company would be unable to operate its mines.
Defective title or failure to comply with operating conditions set out in the mine licences would give rise to impairment risk.
VARIABLES CONSIDERED The Audit Committee considers whether the Company continues to have a robust process to ensure that all required legal documentation is completed correctly on acquisition of land titles particularly in light of litigation and ejido activity.
The specific questions arising from this are i whether there are factors which may give rise to asset impairment ii whether the level of legal provisions and narrative disclosures in the accounts are adequate and iii whetherwhen the Group would be able to resume operations at SoledadDipolos.
SOURCES OF ASSURANCE The Audit Committee has oversight over the progress of the land title review and throughout the year has received verbal and written reports from the Companys Head of Legal based on assessments by the Companys external legal counsel.
ENSURING THAT THE ANNUAL REPORT IS FAIR BALANCED AND UNDERSTANDABLE There are a number of steps that the Board undertakes to ensure that the Annual Report is fair balanced and understandable Management prepares drafts of the Annual Report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017.
Two weeks prior to the Annual Report being approved by the Board members of the Audit Committee and other Directors review a current draft enabling them to assess whether the information was consistent with their understanding of the Companys business.
Suggested changes put forward by the Directors based on knowledge obtained through Board and Audit Committee papers and discussion and other interactions with management are taken into account by management in preparing the final version of the Annual Report.
Any Alternative Performance Measures APM used in the Annual Report are reviewed by the Audit Committee.
Internal Audit undertake a review exercise of the nonfinancial numbers in the Annual Report which are extracted from the Companys operational records.
The Audit Committee reviews the Annual Report and financial statements and then recommends them to the Board for approval.
As a result of the above procedures the Board considers that taken as a whole the Annual Report is fair balanced and understandable.

EXTERNAL AUDIT CONTINUED During 2017 the members of the Audit Committee met twice with representatives from EY without management present and once with management without representatives of EY present to ensure that there are no issues in the relationship between management and the external auditor which it should address.
There were none.
APPOINTMENT OF THE EXTERNAL AUDITOR In February 2017 the Audit Committee considered and recommended the reappointment of the external auditor EY to the Board prior to the Companys Annual General Meeting.
This recommendation was made following a robust tender exercise which had been conducted during 2016 and was outlined in the Audit Committee Report for 2016.
EYs tender in 2016 made certain commitments to enhance the quality of the external audit and the Committee have monitored how EY has fulfilled the commitments made at that time.
The Audit Partner is Daniel Trotman and he has been the Audit Partner for three years.
EVALUATION OF THE EXTERNAL AUDITOR The key criteria against which the external audit tenderers were assessed in 2016 and which remain appropriate for the assessment of EY are as follows Experience in mining with precious metals expertise preferred in companies of a similar size and complexity.
London team experienced with FTSE 100 companies and associated regulation and governance supported by local Mexican team.
Quality of partners in UK and Mexico and quality of their teams evidenced by firm and external evaluations.
Issues from the FRCs Audit Quality Review AQR of the firm relevant to audit of Fresnillo and details of internal processes used for quality assurance.
Quality and experience of other technical resources that may be used on assignments.
How the audit approach is aligned to Fresnillos specific circumstances as set down in detail in their audit plan for the year .
Communication skills in both written documentation and meetings.
Expected continuity of team.
Proposed hours and fees.
Independence of firm and details of internal practices to ensure continuing compliance with independence requirements and freedom from conflicts of interest.
Coordination with parent company management and auditors.
The Audit Committee also reviewed the FRCs Audit Quality Review on EY as a firm the FRC having not selected Fresnillo for review and ensured that no findings concerning EYs audit quality were relevant to the audit of Fresnillo plc.
In February 2018 based on the above criteria and following detailed discussions with management the Audit Committee evaluated the performance of EY in 2017 and concluded that it was appropriate to recommend the reappointment of EY as external auditor at the 2018 Annual General Meeting.
QUALITY AND INDEPENDENCE OF THE EXTERNAL AUDITOR AND NONAUDIT SERVICES POLICY The Audit Committee is mindful of its responsibility to ensure that the external auditor maintains its independence and objectivity and is appropriately qualified with sufficient resources and expertise to fulfil the role.
The Audit Committee specifically reviewed and is satisfied with the independence of EY as the external auditor based on disclosures provided by EY in accordance with UK Ethical Standards for the audit profession.
The Audit Committee reviewed its policy for the provision of nonaudit services to the Fresnillo Group by the external auditor the Policy during the year having updated it in 2016.
No further changes were made to the Policy in 2017.
The current policy permits the engagement of the external auditor to provide statutory audit services certain assurance and due diligence services where fees are less than US5000 to be preapproved.
Any engagement of the external auditor to provide permitted services above US5000 is subject to the specific approval of the Audit Committee.
During 2017 the Audit Committee authorised EY to provide the following services under the Policy on the basis that neither piece of work was deemed by the Audit Committee to compromise EYs independence A short deferred tax training session for the Fresnillo financial reporting team in Torron US4200.
Accounting support for the finance team in relation to the application of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 US23500. iii A review of the calculations underpinning the tax methodology in Pru US7000.
In February 2017 EY informed the Audit Committee that there had been a minor breach of the Ethical Standards on nonaudit services as a result of EY undertaking less than two hours work on tax compliance services in the UK in January 2017.
Such work was permitted prior to 31 December 2016 and the services had been provided in error .
The Audit Committee was satisfied that there was no threat to EYs independence as a result of this matter .
Details of the fees paid to EY during the year as shown in note 28 to the financial statements.

RISK
Management continues to build on the existing risk management framework seeking to enhance risk governance and management across the business in line with the changes to the UK Corporate Governance Code.
In order to support the Board in monitoring the normal risk management activities the Audit Committee reviewed managements activities to develop a continuous monitoring process consisting of validating the effectiveness of current controls continue promoting ownership of risk mitigation and associated controls among the process owners at the business unit level being the first line of defence through their periodic reporting on the effectiveness of controls and ensure that the Groups corporate values and control culture are embedded throughout the organisation.
These efforts have resulted in a transparent analysis of the operational financial and executive management controls for each of the risks that have been identified by management in its risk universe.
A quarterly report is prepared for the Board which explains any significant variations in the KRIs and managements conclusion on the likely effect on the relevant risk ratings andor any modifications in the related controls.
This is reviewed by the Audit Committee prior to its submission to the Board.
During 2017 the Audit Committee and Board formally reviewed the Principal Risks and Uncertainties of the Group prior to the publication of both the interim and fullyear reports.
Further details of the risk management system are set out on page 34.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Companys objectives and policies on financial risk management including information on the Companys exposures to market risk such as foreign currency commodity price interest rate inflation rate and equity price risks credit risk and liquidity risk can be found in note 31 to the financial statements.
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY In the current year the Audit Committee continued to receive updates on the Groups IT strategy its linkage to the Groups overall business strategy and the financial implications of that strategy for the business plan.
The Audit Committee has also focused on the related risks of cyber security.
The Audit Committee was satisfied that progress has been made during the year in each of these areas.
Further information about the Groups approach to IT is set out on pages 50 and 51 of the Strategic Report.
INTERNAL CONTROL The Group has in place internal controls and risk management systems in relation to the Groups financial reporting process and the Groups process for preparing consolidated accounts.

STATEMENTS
During 2017 the Audit Committee has continued to review the quarterly internal control monitoring document which was introduced in 2016 and which is prepared and submitted to the Board at each of its regular meetings.
This document specifically reports on internal controls and the key findings from the quarterly Internal Audit reports.
The process agreed by the Audit Committee to monitor the Groups system of internal controls is focused on improving the understanding of how the various sources of assurance such as operational management financial management executive management and Internal Audit interact in the review and execution of material controls identifying and addressing any gaps in the control framework.
To this end the Audit Committee with the assistance of the risk function and management has assessed its approach to monitoring the ongoing effectiveness of the Groups system of internal controls.
The progress to date was reviewed by the Audit Committee in February 2018.
Further control exceptions identified in the current year include those relating to operational safety compliance with regulations for handling hazardous materials and explosives monitoring of electrical installations installation of auxiliary services within the mine monitoring and operation of tailings deposits and the oversight over contractors.
These issues are not pervasive throughout the Groups operations but each issue has occurred at least at one of the Groups operating areas and plans for remediation have been approved and these are being progressed.
On the recommendation of the Audit Committee the Board agreed that the following statement be made about the review of the system of internal control in the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts.
The Board has through the Executive Committee and the Audit Committee at its February 2018 meeting reviewed the effectiveness of the Groups system of internal controls.
As a result of this review the Board considers that the measures that have been or are planned to be implemented complement Fresnillos risk management framework and are appropriate to the Groups circumstances.
The Board is committed to the continued development of its internal control regime with a view to achieving and maintaining best practice levels of risk management and internal control for international mining companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.
GOING CONCERN The Directors must satisfy themselves as to the Groups ability to continue as a going concern for a minimum of 12 months from the approval of the financial statements.
The Audit Committee supported the Board in this assessment by considering whether in adverse circumstances the Company has adequate liquid resources to meet its obligations as they fall due.
In February 2018 the Audit Committee reviewed the Group budget and cash flow forecasts for the period to December 2019 taking into account the Companys anticipated production profiles at each mine budgeted capital and exploration expenditure and the sensitivity of the cashflow forecasts to movements in metal prices.
The Audit Committee also considered EYs report on this assessment and on the reasonableness of assumptions therein including their consistency with assumptions and estimates used elsewhere in the preparation of the financial statements.
In particular the Committee challenged management on the feasibility of the mitigating actions and the potential speed of their implementation.
As a result of the procedures performed the Audit Committee satisfied itself that the going concern basis of preparation is appropriate and the financial statements appropriately reflect the conclusions on going concern.
LONGERTERM VIABILITY Having adopted a robust process in 2015 for the preparation of the initial Viability Statement which was described in the 2015 Audit Committee Report in 2016 the Audit Committee considered with management ways of further enhancing the disclosures by including references to contingency planning.
The Audit Committee agreed with management that no further changes were required in 2017.
The Boards Going Concern Statement and longerterm Viability Statement are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 48 and 49.

Evaluation of Internal Audit.
TWICE A YEAR  Meeting between the Audit Committee and Internal Audit without management present.
EVERY MEETING  Review of significant Internal Audit findings including progress on red flags based on the audits conducted during the most recent quarter .
The Head of Internal Audit and Internal Audit Manager attend all meetings of the Audit Committee.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee met separately with them five times during 2017 around the time of each Audit Committee meeting.
The Internal Audit team seeks to complete audits of all the operating risks across all of the Fresnillo Groups mining assets on a regular basis.
During the year the Audit Committee received specific input from Internal Audit to focus on four particular areas New mines Following the emphasis on auditing the Companys new mines which was initiated in 2016 Internal Audit completed its examination to ensure that proper procedures were implemented from the beginning in those new operations and to ascertain whether there were any lessons to be learned.
This work was fundamental to refine methodologies and working arrangements between multiple disciplines to provide enhanced transparency to management about operational and financial performance throughout the process of building and commissioning new mines.
Red flags At each meeting during the year the Audit Committee has focused on the progress made by management in dealing with red flag items raised during internal audit visits to ensure that the management responses to remediation are appropriate and timely.
Significant progress which has been monitored by Internal Audit has been made during the year to reduce the number of issues requiring longterm remedial work that remained outstanding at the end of 2017.
IT issues including cyber security During 2017 the Audit Committee received presentations from the Head of IT setting out the Group IT Strategy for the year and demonstrating how this supports the overall Group Strategy.
Within these presentations the Audit Committee considered the steps being taken by management to deal with cyber security threats liaised with Internal Audit to ensure that appropriate controls are or are planned to be in place and reviewed the extent to which awareness has been raised internally.
Data protection Internal audit monitored the steps being taken to ensure that appropriate levels of procedural compliance with the requirements of Mexican data protection legislation are in place.
Human Resources has taken over daytoday responsibility for the implementation of the relevant procedures.
The Audit Committee understands the steps being taken by management to deal with these matters and is satisfied with the progress being made.
In addition the Audit Committee also monitored the quality of the dialogue between Internal Audit and the Executive Committee in reviewing internal audit findings and agreeing action plans with appropriate levels of operational buyin to deal with the points raised.
The Audit Committee met with the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer several times during the year to review the outstanding points and is satisfied with the progress achieved through this dialogue.
The members of the Audit Committee evaluate the performance of the Internal Audit team annually and in 2017 this process was facilitated by the Chairman of the Audit Committee who discussed the findings of that review with the Head of Internal Audit and Internal Audit Manager and consulted with his colleagues on the Audit Committee before finalising the review.
When reviewing the Internal Audit Plan for the year the Audit Committee also considered the personnel available within the Internal Audit team their expertise and experience to resource their increasing workload.

WHISTLEBLOWING
KEY ACTIVITY IN 2017 Review of whistleblowing cases considered by Honour Commission at each meeting of the Audit Committee.
The Fresnillo Plays Fair whistleblower hotline allows stakeholders to anonymously report via an independent third party violations of the Groups Code of Conduct.
The results are assessed by an independent third party and processed for review by the Honour Commission which comprises the Chief Executive Officer the Chief Operating Officer the Compliance Officer currently the Chief Financial Officer the Director of Internal Audit the Vice President of Exploration and the Legal Manager .
These arrangements have been established for some time and the Audit Committee is responsible for ensuring that appropriate investigation of all whistleblowing incidents is undertaken in a timely manner .
In 2017 there were a total of 46 reports a 10% decrease over 2016.
The Audit Committee continues to view this level as encouraging for our efforts to promote a greater understanding of the benefits of reporting issues.
The Audit Committee considers that this indicates that employees recognise that such reports are valued and investigations are rigorously evaluated.
68% of the 2017 reports were actioned in the year with the remainder having been raised in the latter part of the year still being under investigation.
Fresnillo plc has a whistleblowing line available for all stakeholders including employees third parties and the general public.
Information regarding this whistleblowing mechanism is widely circulated with access available via our website in the Ethics and CultureCode of Conduct section.
The whistleblowing reports are reviewed on a quarterly basis by the Honour Commission and then presented to the Audit
The purpose of the whistleblowing line is to encourage employees and others to raise good faith concerns about misconduct that goes or appears to go against the Companys internal Code of Conduct and our institutional values.

The Audit Committee considers that current level of issues raised is good evidence that the programme is being taken seriously across the Group and is operating satisfactorily albeit that it was noticed in 2017 that the process of investigating issues raised in the cases reported took more time to arrive at the appropriate solution which was the reason behind the increased number of cases in progress of investigation over 2016.
FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
RELATED PARTIES Peoles owns just under 75% of the issued share capital of the Company see page 148 and therefore has and will continue to have a significant level of influence over the affairs and operations of Fresnillo.
Being part of the same Group also provides an opportunity for synergistic benefits to be achieved operationally and administratively by combining the resourcing of common services that can be shared between Peoles and Fresnillo.
The principal arrangements between the Company and related parties are THE SHARED SERVICES AGREEMENT The Shared Services Agreement is an agreement between the Company and Peoles under which 23 categories of services are provided to the Company by Peoles.
The
Shared Services Agreement was renewed for five years with effect from 31 December 2012.
In order to ensure that Fresnillo is charged appropriately for services rendered by Peoles under the Shared Services Agreement management has regular meetings with Peoles to discuss its performance against the Key Performance Indicators KPIs for each of the different categories of service where issues of noncompliance are addressed and remediation agreed.
In addition Internal Audit conducts reviews of approximately one third of the services provided each year to ensure that these services are provided in accordance with the agreed KPIs.
As a result all services are reviewed by Internal Audit over a threeyear cycle.
During 2017 the Audit Committee reviewed the planning for the renewal of the Shared Service Agreement in early 2018.
Supported by KPMG this process seeks to use third party benchmarking across all of the service categories covered by the Share Services Agreement to ensure that the scope and pricing for each service is appropriate.
The Audit Committee also reviewed the performance of Peoles in meeting the KPIs for the different service categories over the current term of the Shared Services Agreement.
The Audit Committee is satisfied that appropriate services have been achieved.
The Audit Committee discussed with KPMG their methodology for benchmarking prices for each of the 24 separate services now required and their evaluation of all of the prices tendered.
Their resulting conclusion was a price for 2018 the first year of the new fiveyear Shared Services Agreement which represented an increase of less than 10% over 2017 made up from inflation and additional service levels required offset by operational efficiencies.
The Audit Committee concluded that the new fiveyear Shared Services Agreement was reasonable in all respects and recommended that the independent Nonexecutive Directors approve its signing by the Company which they did at the Board meeting in February 2018.
THE METMEX AGREEMENT During the year the Audit Committee considered the proposed charges in respect of the MetMex arrangements for 2017 comparing proposed prices to comparable prices charged by MetMex to independent customers and to those of other refineries taking account of ore composition and transport costs to ensure that they are reasonable.
Based on the satisfactory outcome of that review the Chairman of the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the independent Directors approve the proposed charges for 2017 under the MetMex arrangements which they did at the Board meeting in October 2017.
OTHER AGREEMENTS There are other dealings with related parties in the ordinary course of business e.
Directors will from timetotime be reviewed by the Audit Committee to ensure that the arrangements are on a reasonable armslength basis.
KEY ACTIVITIES IN 2017 Review of related parties list and payments to key external advisors.
Review of insurance programme including the role of related parties in the insurance programme.
Review of MetMex treatment charge and refining charge rates for 2017.
Review of preparations for the renewal of the Shared Services Agreement in 2018.

EFFECTIVENESS
Since the inception of the Audit Committee there has been a continuing programme of evaluation which has embraced the activities of the Committee itself as well as the performances respectively of the external auditor and the Internal Audit function.
At least once every three years these reviews have been externally facilitated with internal evaluation exercises undertaken during the intervening years.
During 2017 there were two key workstreams to this activity i followup to the internally facilitated evaluation of the Audit Committee undertaken in 2016 and ii an externally facilitated review of the Audit Committee undertaken by Lintstock as part of its review of the effectiveness of the Board and its Committees.
2016 evaluation followup The internal evaluation in 2016 was facilitated by the Company Secretary using a questionnaire based approach.
This was the final step in a threeyear process which commenced with the previous external evaluation in 2014.
The conclusions of the 2016 evaluation were that the Audit Committee was satisfied that its core duties were being performed well however it identified five further areas for review during 2017.
The following table shows the progress made on those five areas of review during the year ACTION PROGRESS Review of the Boards postinvestment review procedures.
A new format for reporting to the Board on post investment appraisal was presented to the Board at its July meeting.
Oversight of managements evaluation of the Shared Services Agreement as it approaches its renewal date.
A presentation on the process and metrics for the renewal of the Shared Services Agreement was presented at the February 2018 meeting of the Committee with the Agreement being presented to the Board for approval by the Independent Non executive Directors in February 2018.
Oversight of the IT Governance Committee in relation to the management of the IT strategy and ITrelated internal controls and the liaison with Internal Audit.
The Audit Committee has received presentations from the Head of IT on the IT Strategy and its interface with the Companys Business Plan and Strategy.
The Audit Committee Chairman has attended numerous meetings with IT personnel to oversee the production of detailed plans and timelines to deliver the IT requirements of the Companys Business Plan.
The role of the IT Governance Committee in overseeing the IT Strategy was reviewed and progress noted.
The interface between the Audit Committee Internal Audit and the HSECR Committee in relation to internal audit findings relating to health safety and environmental matters.
Early in 2017 we decided to combine these two actions to better reflect managements efforts to rationalise the various elements of nonfinancial information into a more coherent structure.
The Audit Committee has overseen this work and liaised with Internal Audit to ensure that any data required from operational records is sourced appropriately.
The relationship between the Audit Committees oversight of the Honour Commission and the wider governance of culture by the Board and the HSECR

FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
EFFECTIVENESS CONTINUED 2017 external evaluation followup The 2017 evaluation of the Committee by Lintstock used a questionnairebased approach.
Lintstock concluded from the completed questionnaires that the management of Audit Committee meetings in terms of the annual cycle of work the meeting agendas and supporting documentation and the time and input during meetings was highly rated and that the Committee functioned effectively and no areas for improvement were noted.
Nevertheless the Audit Committee from its own evaluation identified that there were areas which warranted further review in 2018.
Oversight to ensure that the lessons learnt from the postinvestment appraisal exercise in 2017 are correctly reflected in managements methodologies for new projects.
Continued liaison with the IT Governance Committee over the development of ITrelated internal controls and the interaction with Internal Audit.
Oversight of the development of performance indicators on nonfinancial information and the related work by Internal Audit.
Continued liaison with management over progress on the various outstanding matters with the Mexican tax authorities.
NEXT STEPS The Audit Committee intends to undertake an externallyfacilitated evaluation of the Internal Audit function during 2018.
It will conduct an internal review of its own effectiveness in 2018.

DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT
CHAIRMANS ANNUAL STATEMENT
DEAR SHAREHOLDER I am pleased to take this opportunity to give you an overview of the work of the Remuneration Committee during 2017.
The most important job for the Remuneration Committee in 2017 was the renewal of our Directors Remuneration Policy at the Annual General Meeting in May.
We proposed a few minor amendments to the Policy which were favourably received and I am delighted that our independent shareholders overwhelmingly supported the renewal of the Policy.
My Remuneration Committee colleagues and I welcome shareholders endorsement of the Policy.
Having received such strong support for our approach to executive remuneration we will continue to work hard to ensure that our approach remains the most appropriate one to serve the longterm interests of the Company.
During the year Fernando Ruiz who had served on the Committee from its inception in 2008 stepped down from the
Fernandos contribution to the Committee over the past nine years has been greatly appreciated by his colleagues and we thank him wholeheartedly for his commitment and support during that time.
I am delighted to welcome Jaime Serra an independent Nonexecutive Director to the Committee and look forward to working with him.
In commenting on the activities of the Remuneration Committee during the year I would like to highlight the time and attention that the Committee devoted to first ensuring that executive remuneration is aligned to remuneration trends across the Group and second ensuring that remuneration promotes the longterm interests of the
In reviewing the Chief Executive Officers salary each year the Remuneration Committee takes account of the salary increases agreed for the whole workforce as well as other actuarial benchmark data on salaries.
In 2017 the CEO was awarded a 3.5% increase in salary compared to an average benchmark increase of 4.61%.
In determining this level of increase the Remuneration Committee took account of previous increases in salary awarded to the Chief Executive Officer .
The Committee also received periodic benchmarking data from Willis Towers Watson as required by the Remuneration Policy which confirmed that the CEOs total remuneration remains well inside the parameters set in the Policy.
While the CEO participates in a bonus scheme which is modest by any FTSE 100listed company standard he is not permitted by Mexican law to participate in the PTU scheme the statutory employee profitsharing arrangement which is available to all other Mexican employees and which has the potential to pay annual bonuses which are a significantly higher proportion of salary than the annual bonus scheme for the CEO.
The CEO also participates in the same pension scheme arrangements as all other employees.
The Remuneration Committee therefore believes that the CEOs remuneration is well aligned to that of the workforce as a whole.
Prior to the 2017 AGM the Remuneration Committee spent time considering whether any changes were needed to the Remuneration Policy and concluded that while some minor amendments would be appropriate for example in relation to the exercise of discretion the overall approach was correct.
Nevertheless the Remuneration Committee revisited the question of whether long term incentives should be introduced into the Policy.
This requirement was discussed with advisers and it was concluded that there was no need to introduce longerterm incentives at this time.
The reasons for this are twofold.
Firstly the Committee is satisfied that the annual cash bonus scheme contains sufficient elements and incentives to ensure that the Group is sustainable over the longterm.
In particular the high proportion of bonus paid for replenishment of reserves and resources and delivery of growth projects as well as the penalties in place for unhealthy unsafe and environmentally unfriendly practices are designed to focus executive attention on the longterm viability of the Company as well as shortterm performance.
Second we have always maintained that longterm incentives are not a key feature of remuneration within the Mexican market and we have been consistent on that since we listed in London back in 2008.
During the year we asked Willis Towers Watson to evaluate that assumption and while there is some anecdotal evidence that longterm incentives are beginning to emerge as a feature of remuneration in Mexico we are yet to be convinced that our Remuneration Policy needs to be changed.
We will continue to monitor this aspect between now and the next renewal of our Policy in 2020.
The activities of the Remuneration Committee are described in more detail in the following sections of this Report.
Staying in line with our previous approach to remuneration reporting we have published remuneration information in respect of our Chief Executive Officer as if he were a member of the Board even though that is not currently the case.
We believe this is within the spirit of our reporting obligations even if it is not strictly required as it adds to the transparency of our reporting.
As ever I am always interested to hear the views of shareholders on our approach to executive remuneration.

Where a change of emphasis is considered to be necessary the weighting will be amended in future years.
2 Any decrease in equivalent ounces produced andor in reserves and resources will result in points being deducted from the total points scored in proportion to the level of the shortfall compared to the previous year .
Production excludes amounts from the Silverstream contract and is compared against budget for the year .
Total resources includes 100% of all of the resource estimates at the Groups controlled mines irrespective of ownership.

DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
APPENDIX DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY
This part of the Directors Remuneration Report sets out the remuneration policy of the Company and has been prepared in accordance with The Large and Mediumsized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013 the Regulations.
The policy has been developed taking into account the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2016 and the views of our major shareholders.
It describes the policy to be applied for the financial year ending 31 December 2017 and beyond.
The remuneration policy was put to a vote at the 2017 Annual General Meeting and overwhelmingly approved.
The effective date of the policy is therefore the date of the 2017 Annual General Meeting of the Company 23 May 2017.
As required by UK law the remuneration policy is binding in relation to Directors.
The Company currently has no Executive Directors who would be bound by the remuneration policy.
However the Company will as it has previously done treat the Chief Executive Officer as if he were an Executive Director for the purposes of the remuneration policy and for reporting on his remuneration.
REMUNERATION POLICY The Groups remuneration policy seeks to ensure that the Company is able to attract retain and motivate its Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee.
The retention of key management and the alignment of management incentives and the creation of shareholder value being key objectives of this policy.
Setting base salaries for Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee at an appropriate level is a key to managerial retention in Mexico.
Therefore the Remuneration Committee seeks to ensure that salaries are market competitive both within the Mexican context and internationally for comparable companies.
Total compensation is set within a range around the median level for the Companys peer group within Mexico and internationally total remuneration is benchmarked triennially to ensure that the whole remuneration package is maintained at this level over the long term.
Salaries are positioned within the range according to experience and service.
The table below sets out the key elements of Executive Directors pay set out in the remuneration policy the Policy Table BASE SALARY PROVIDES THE CORE REWARD FOR THE ROLE Operation Reviewed annually and fixed for 12 months starting on 1 April each year and the review is influenced by Role experience and performance.
Average workforce salary adjustments.
Mexican economic factors.
Comparison with the Companys peer group in Mexico and internationally.
Salaries are benchmarked triennially by reference to companies of similar size and complexity and will be positioned within a midrange of the Companys comparator peer group in Mexico and internationally.
The next review will take place in April 2019.
Maximum value The Executive Directors salary will be reviewed taking account of the benchmarking information received by the Remuneration Committee and the maximum value of the Executive Directors base salary will be positioned within the midrange for companies in the peer group of Mexican and international resources companies.
An Executive Directors salary will be increased in line with increases applied across the whole workforce.
In exceptional circumstances the Executive Directors salary may be increased by up to but never more than 10% above the average pay increase for the whole workforce of the Company in any year .
The rationale for such increases will be fully explained in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Performance metric The Remuneration Committee considers individual salaries at the appropriate meeting each year by reference to the factors noted under the Operation heading in this table.
Details of the current remuneration of the Executive Director are provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Discretion The Remuneration Committee will establish the Companys comparator peer group in Mexico and internationally as part of the triennial review which it will consider in April 2019.
The peer group will be reviewed again in April 2019.
The Committee will report on the outcome of these reviews within the relevant Annual Report on Remuneration.

ANNUAL BONUS REWARDS THE ACHIEVEMENT OF BOTH SHORT AND LONGTERM FINANCIAL AND STRATEGIC BUSINESS TARGETS AND DELIVERY OF PERSONAL OBJECTIVES Operation Targets are renewed annually and relate to the strategic aims of the business as a whole.
A scoring system is used for the plan.
Each objective set for the executive at the beginning of the year is allocated a pointsrating which represents a median performance target for that objective.
Upper and lower point thresholds are set to allow for outstanding performance and to ensure that underperformance is not rewarded.
For each member of the Executive Committee including the Chief Executive Officer the Chief Financial Officer the Vice President of Exploration and the Chief Operating Officer a bonus is only payable if the aggregate performance equals or exceeds 100 points.
Bonus payments are paid for aggregate performance against target at or above 100 points as follows Points Variable pay months salary Variable pay % of salary Less than 100 Zero Zero 100.00103.75 Two 16.67 103.76107.50 Three 25.00 107.51111.00 Four 33.33 111.01115.00 Five 41.67 Maximum value The maximum percentage of salary is 50% six months salary and is paid where Executive Directors achieve 115.01 points or more under the Annual Bonus Plan the target is 100 points.
Performance metric The KPI targets set out in the previous table will apply and are intended to focus on risks that are within the control and influence of management.
Thus the management of safety security project human resource exploration and environmental risks are all currently implicitly covered within the
The KPIs and targets which are set by reference to the reserved and resources and financial metrics at the previous year end andor set in the budget for the forthcoming financial year are also designed to ensure that both shortterm objectives and the longterm development of the Fresnillo Group are given equal priority.
Details of the measures targets and performance which is tested on an annual basis will be provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Discretion The Remuneration Committee considers that the KPIs upon which bonuses are based may need to evolve from yeartoyear in line with the strategy and therefore it retains the discretion to make modest adjustments to the KPIs themselves the bonus bands within the overall maximum and the individual KPI weightings from yeartoyear .
The Remuneration Committee retains the discretion to adjust bonus payments in the following circumstances A downward adjustment where the KPI outcomes would result in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee in a bonus payment which cannot be justified by the Companys financial or operational performance during the year or subsequently in respect of previous years.
In this case a downward adjustment would be applied.
Where factors outside the control of Executive Directors e. significantly depressed the level of points awarded.
In deciding whether adjustment is merited the Remuneration Committee will consider the appropriateness of the Executive Directors response to those circumstances in this situation a modest upward adjustment may be considered.
Poor executive response to adverse health safety or environmental performance during the year in which case a downward adjustment would be considered.
The use of any such discretions will be fully explained in future Directors Remuneration Reports.
Note Any adjustment in individual KPI weightings will not result in their achievement being any less difficult to satisfy.

Benefits may be changed if Company policy on benefits changes.
Maximum value The current benefits are set out in the Annual Remuneration Report.
The maximum value of benefits will be determined by Company policy that is applicable to all employees.

Executive Directors are entitled to membership of the defined contribution scheme.

Performance metric None.
Discretion Not applicable.
ALIGNMENT OF EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION AND THE MARKET In setting the fixed remuneration of Executive Directors and the members of the Executive Committee information relating to the mining company comparators is provided by various consultants.
Information relating to the Mexican economic metrics and internal benchmarking is collated by management for the Remuneration Committee to consider .
Reviews are conducted by Willis Towers Watson triennially.
These enable the Remuneration Committee to validate the Companys policy towards remuneration and ensure that it is globally as well as locally competitive.
The analysis evaluates the elements of base salary shortterm compensation guaranteed payments and shortterm bonus and longterm compensation primarily stock programmes separately.
With assistance from Willis Towers Watson the Remuneration Committee has established a peer group which will be used to benchmark any Executive Directors and any Executive Committee members remuneration to ensure that it remains within the parameters set out in this policy see page 157 of the Annual Report on Remuneration.
COMPARISON OF EXECUTIVE AND WIDER COMPANY REMUNERATION When setting pay and benefits for Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee the Remuneration Committee takes account of pay and conditions across the Group.
It will consider the overall pay increase percentage negotiated with employee representatives as its starting point.
Subject to the 10% limit in the Policy Table the Remuneration Committee may agree pay increases above or below the agreed percentage in exceptional circumstances where in its discretion it considers such variance to the norm to be justified.
Other than the Willis Towers Watson report specifically commissioned by the Remuneration Committee the same benchmark reports are used in the evaluation of executive and employee remuneration thus providing a common approach to both.
Below Board level a statutory profitsharing arrangement PTU is operated which in some years has enabled employees to receive significant levels of bonus in line with the increased profitability of the relevant employing company.
Neither the Chief Executive Officer nor any of the Nonexecutive Directors participate in a PTU scheme within the Fresnillo Group.
The other members of senior management group below Board level are employed by Servicios Administrativos Fresnillo S. de C. which pays annual PTU payments.
However such payments are modest.
The Group operates two pension schemes i a defined benefit scheme which was closed to new members on 1 July 2007 with benefits frozen at this date for existing members subject to indexation with reference to the Mexican National Consumer Price Index and ii a defined contribution scheme which was introduced on 1 July 2007.
Membership of the latter scheme is voluntary members earning a salary of no more than 25 times the minimum wage in force from time to time may make contributions of 5% to the scheme.
On behalf of members earning a salary of no more than 25 times the minimum wage in force from time to time the employing company may make contributions of 5% to the scheme.
The employing company may also make additional contributions between 58% of salary to this plan.
Members may elect to match percentages between 5% to 8% of salary.
Executive Directors may participate the Groups pension schemes on the same basis as any other employee.

ENGAGEMENT WITH SHAREHOLDERS ON REMUNERATION The composition of the Remuneration Committee has been designed to ensure that the views of the controlling shareholder through the membership of the Chairman of the Board on the Committee and the independent shareholders through the membership of a UKbased Director on the Committee can be represented.
The Remuneration Committee has considered the views of organisations such as Institutional Shareholder Services ISS and the Investment Association both generally and as reported to the Company in relation to its own executive remuneration practices prior to each Annual General Meeting when considering the Remuneration Policy and its application.
The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee also discussed aspects of the Remuneration Policy in person with ISS and there were no major concerns raised.
The Remuneration Committee does not consult with employees in setting Directors remuneration.
POLICY ON RECRUITMENT The Remuneration Committee will consider the remuneration of new Executive Directors by reference to the remuneration policy set out previously.
The Remuneration Committee does not as a default position pay signon payments or compensate new Directors for any variable remuneration forfeited from any employment prior to joining the Board.
If it did such payments would be fully explained in the next Annual Report on Remuneration both as to the reason for payment and the rationale for the quantum.
Salary will be set so as to be market competitive both within the Mexican context and internationally for comparable companies and taking account of the experience and seniority of the appointee coming into the new role.
The Remuneration Committee is likely to set base salaries below median on appointment while retaining discretion to award increases during the first and possibly subsequent years to bring salaries into the normal range expected for Executive Directors in line with the Companys stated policy.
Such increases will not exceed the maximum level set out in the Policy Table.
New Executive Directors will receive benefits and pensions in line with the Companys existing policy and will be able to participate in the Annual Bonus Plan on a prorated basis for the portion of the financial year for which they are in post.
The maximum level of variable pay for new recruits will be the same as that set out in the Policy Table for existing employees prorated as necessary.
POLICY ON LOSS OF OFFICE Other than in circumstances of gross misconduct Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee including the Chief Executive Officer leaving employment from the Group will be entitled to receive salary and prorated annual bonus based on performance to the date of leaving.
Statutory entitlements are payable according to Mexican labour law based on length of service.
Mexican labour law does not make any provision for employers and employees to give or receive notice of termination of employment.
Therefore the Committee will not make payments in lieu of notice to departing executives unless required to do so by law.
No contractual commitments concerning loss of office were entered into with any Director prior to 27 June 2012.
ANNUAL BONUS PLAN AND POLICY ON VARIABLE REMUNERATION It is the Companys policy not to use its equity to incentivise longterm performance.
The Companys core strategy is one of longterm sustainable growth.
Sustainable growth in mining requires the steady and safe expansion of the Groups operations through the discovery of new resources and construction maintenance andor expansion of new mines.
No distinction is therefore made between short and longterm incentives.
The Company operates a single cashbased incentive plan for Executive Directors and the members of the Executive Committee including the Chief Executive Officer .
MALUS AND CLAWBACK The Remuneration Committee has considered whether malus andor clawback provisions should be incorporated into the service agreement for the Chief Executive Officer .
Given that the Company does not operate any remuneration plans with a timeframe of more than one year the Remuneration Committee does not consider that there is much value in introducing clawback provisions into the contractual arrangements with the Chief Executive Officer at this stage.
Within this remuneration policy the Remuneration Committee reserves the right to make downward adjustment to bonus payments where the KPI outcomes would result in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee in a bonus payment which cannot be justified by the Companys financial or personal performance during the year or subsequently in respect of previous years.
In this case a downward adjustment would be applied.

OVERVIEW OF OUR AUDIT APPROACH Key audit matters  Recognition of related party transactions including revenue recognition Valuation of the Silverstream contract Disclosures provisions and asset recoverability arising from the El Bajo ejido litigation and land disputes Recoverable amount of mining assets Potential tax uncertainties arising from tax authority inspections and changes in legislation Recoverable amount of investments in subsidiaries Parent Company Only Audit scope  We performed an audit of the complete financial information of 5 components being the 4 operating mining units and the Parent Company.
These components accounted for 100% of Revenues 96% of Profit before tax excluding Silverstream revaluation effects and gain on the sale of concessions and 82% of Total assets.
In addition we performed specified procedures on specific balances at a further 5 components.
These components accounted for 100% of the Silverstream revaluation effects and gain on the sale of concessions 4% of Profit before tax excluding Silverstream revaluation effects and gain on the sale of concessions and 16% of Total assets.
Materiality  Overall Group materiality of US31.0m which represents 5% of forecast profit before tax before Silverstream revaluation effects and gain on the sale of concessions.
KEY AUDIT MATTERS Key audit matters are those matters that in our professional judgment were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement whether or not due to fraud that we identified.
These matters included those which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in our opinion thereon and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 In the table below each key audit matter is attributed an icon which is used to map these to our components in scope in the subsequent section below.
KEY AUDIT MATTER RECOGNITION OF RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS INCLUDING REVENUE RECOGNITION All of the Groups current year revenue from the sale of goods being concentrates dor slag and precipitates US2101.6 million 2016 US1905.5 million and a significant amount of its expenses incurred US111.6 million 2016 US84.0 million arise from transactions with related parties.
These related parties are principally subsidiaries of the Groups direct parent Industrias Peoles Peoles.
Principal transactions include the sale of goods to the MetMex Peoles refinery administrative services received and the Silverstream contract.
There is a risk that if not at arms length or not reflecting the goods or services provided in the period such transactions could be used to manipulate earnings or to distribute profits to the Groups parent.
There is also a risk that revenues are inappropriately recognised as a result of incorrect cutoff or inappropriate measurement of product sold.
There is an ongoing focus by the Mexican tax authorities on transfer pricing as reflected by the current tax inspections.
There is therefore the potential risk of tax exposures arising from related party transactions.
Our judgment is that the level of risk in this area remains consistent with the prior year .
We have not made significant changes to our audit response compared to the prior year .
Related party transactions are disclosed in note 27 to the consolidated financial statements Revenues in note 4 and relevant accounting policies in note 2.
OUR AUDIT RESPONSE We performed full scope audit procedures over this risk area in 5 components which covered 100% of the aggregate risk amount relating to revenue and 61% relating to related party expenses.
In addition we performed specified procedures in 1 component which covered 38% of the aggregate risk amount relating to related party expenses.
We also performed specified procedures over the Silverstream contract which covered 100% of the risk amount.
Identification of related parties and related party transactions We evaluated the appropriateness of managements process for identifying recording and reporting related party transactions.
We read contracts and agreements with related parties to understand the nature of the transactions.
Throughout the performance of our audit procedures we remained alert for any related party transactions outside the normal course of business.
Revenue recognition  On a sample basis we performed testing to verify physical deliveries of product in the year .
We performed revenue cutoff testing by reference to shipment dates.
We evaluated the appropriateness of the accounting for embedded derivatives arising from the provisional pricing terms in sales contracts.
We obtained an understanding of the basis of the treatment and refining charges negotiated between the Group and Peoles for the current year these being deducted from revenue.
We compared actual revenues on a disaggregated basis to detailed expectations developed based on production in the year and market prices for relevant metals to identify and understand variances for further investigation.
Related party expenses  On a sample basis we tested related party expenses against underlying contractual terms.
We utilised data analysis tools to interrogate entire data sets for potential related party transactions.
We compared actual results against detailed expectations of income statement line items impacted by related party transactions to corroborate that there was no evidence of manipulation.
Silverstream contract  We tested a sample of cash receipts in respect of silver that is payable under the contract in the year .
The valuation of the Silverstream contract is discussed separately below.
Accuracy of disclosures  We verified that related party disclosures in the financial statements are consistent with the results of our audit procedures.

KEY AUDIT MATTER Identification of related parties and related party transactions We along with our internal transfer pricing specialist obtained and reviewed the most recent report for 2016 to management from its transfer pricing specialists.
We reviewed a letter provided by the specialist to management in February 2018 providing an update with respect to transfer pricing applied in 2017.
We met with the specialist to further understand the content of the letter and to assess the conclusions reached.
We assessed the specialist as a specialist engaged by management.
Revenue recognition  We developed detailed expectations for production volumes based on our interviews with management published production reports and internal reporting to the Executive
We performed analytical review procedures applying a low variance threshold comparing revenue and production costs against the expectations we developed.
We used EYs bespoke data analysis tools to search for terms indicating related parties and prepare a summary of transactions related to known relatedparty vendors and customers which we compared to the schedule provided by management to the Audit Committee.
KEY OBSERVATIONS COMMUNICATED TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE Our procedures did not identify issues with the identification recording or reporting of related party transactions.
We concluded that revenue recognition in the year is appropriate including the treatment of related provisional pricing terms.
In respect of transfer pricing in transactions with related parties we consider that the work undertaken by managements transfer pricing specialist is appropriate for Mexican tax law and also to support the appropriateness of the pricing applied to these transactions for financial reporting considerations.
KEY AUDIT MATTER VALUATION OF THE SILVERSTREAM CONTRACT The valuation of the Silverstream contract US538.9 million at 31 December 2017 2016 US467.5 million a derivative financial instrument is estimated by management using a discounted cash flow model.
Key assumptions are the estimation of the reserves and resources and the related production profile of the Sabinas mine owned and operated by Peoles future silver prices and the discount rate applied.
These assumptions require management judgment and estimation.
The resulting valuation is sensitive to changes in these assumptions which may result in material revaluation effects in the financial statements US113.7 million pretax gain in 2017 2016 US133.5 million pretax gain.
Our judgment is that the level of risk in this area remains consistent with the prior year .
We adapted our procedures to consider the findings of a specialist engaged by Peoles to assess its estimation process of the mineral reserves and resources of the Sabinas mine in the current year .
The nature of the Silverstream contract and related valuation considerations are disclosed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements and the relevant accounting policies in note 2.
FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 OUR AUDIT RESPONSE We performed specified procedures over the valuation of the Silverstream contract at 31 December 2017 and related income statement revaluation effects.
These procedures covered 100% of the risk amount.
Valuation model  In conjunction with our valuation specialists we evaluated the appropriateness of the valuation approach and related model used by the Company to determine the fair value of the Silverstream contract under accounting standards.
Reserves and resources and production profile of the Sabinas mine We interviewed the Sabinas mine geologist in order to understand the assumptions used in the estimation of reserves and resources and movements in the estimation in the year .
We issued instructions to the auditor of Peoles to perform procedures and report to us in respect of the reserves and resources estimate and mine plan of the Sabinas mine.
These procedures included conducting walkthroughs to confirm our understanding of Peoles managements processes to estimate quantities of reserves and resources and to develop the Sabinas mine plan testing of certain key Peoles controls which address the risks associated with the estimation of reserves and resources quantities and accuracy of the resulting mine plan gaining an understanding of reasons for changes in estimates of reserves and resources in the year assessing the professional competence objectivity and capabilities of Peoles internal specialists involved in the estimation of reserves and resources quantities and evaluating the reasonableness and appropriateness of inputs to the reserves and resources estimates and Sabinas mine plan as at 31 December 2017.
In the current year Peoles has engaged SRK Consulting SRK to perform certain procedures over its reserve and resource estimation process.
We have therefore also instructed the auditor of Peoles to gain an understanding of the scope of these procedures review the conclusions reached by the external specialist and assess whether there are any implications for the estimate of Sabinas reserves and resources and related mine plan as at 31 December 2017 and assess the professional competence objectivity and capabilities of the specialist.
We discussed the results of the above procedures and reviewed key working papers.
We performed sensitivity analysis on inferred resources included in the mine plan.
Key economic assumptions in the valuation With assistance from our valuation specialists we corroborated key economic assumptions in the valuation including future silver prices foreign exchange rates and the discount rate applied.
This included comparison to market data to consider the appropriateness of silver price and discount rate assumptions when considered together in the valuation model and analysis of the consistency of assumptions to other accounting estimates.
We performed sensitivity analysis on the combination of silver price assumptions and discount rate.
KEY OBSERVATIONS COMMUNICATED TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE The valuation model is consistent with that used in prior periods and we consider this appropriate for the nature of this long term derivative contract.
We highlighted the sensitivity of the valuation to economic input assumptions most significantly silver price and discount rate.
We consider that both managements long term silver price and discount rate assumptions are at the lower end of respective ranges considered appropriate by EY valuation specialists.
We reported sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the financial impact of changing these assumptions.

KEY AUDIT MATTER DISCLOSURES PROVISIONS AND ASSET RECOVERABILITY ARISING FROM THE EL BAJO EJIDO LITIGATION AND LAND DISPUTES The El Bajo litigation and land disputes may create uncertainty around the Groups ability to realise the carrying values of impacted assets in the Groups balance sheet and may give rise to further asset impairment.
Related assets are capitalised mining costs and inventory held in leaching pads at the impacted mine site.
The assessment of the recoverability of impacted assets and appropriate disclosure or provisions in the financial statements requires judgement about the future legal outcome of claims and land disputes and estimates of any related financial impacts.
Our judgment is that the level of risk in this area remains consistent with the prior year .
We have not made significant changes to our audit response compared to the prior year .
Contingencies in respect of the El Bajo ejido litigation and land disputes are disclosed in note 26 to the consolidated financial statements and the relevant accounting policies in note 2.
KEY AUDIT MATTER OUR AUDIT RESPONSE We performed full scope audit procedures over this risk area in 1 component which covered 100% of the risk amount.
Recoverability of noncurrent assets We assessed managements conclusion that there is sufficient likelihood of future economic benefits flowing from the use of assets impacted by the El Bajo land disputes that continue to be carried on the Groups balance sheet.
We evaluated managements assessment of related indicators of impairment in respect of those assets.
Inventory valuation  We assessed managements estimation of the recoverable value of inventory that is impacted by land disputes including corroborating gold price assumptions to market data.
Future legal outcome of claims We evaluated managements assessment of the current status of the El Bajo ejido litigation and claims against the Group and considered whether there is a requirement for any provision or related disclosures under accounting standards.
We obtained and read independent legal confirmation letters from the Groups external lawyers advising on these issues and assessed these for consistency with managements conclusions.
We assessed these lawyers as specialists engaged by management.
We assessed the Groups internal legal counsel as a management specialist.
We reviewed related disclosures in the Annual Report and Accounts to consider their appropriateness and completeness.
Management override  As the evaluation of related controls requires the evaluation of the assumptions used in and the output of that process we do not seek to rely on these controls.
As such we did not specifically address the risk of management override of controls in this area but rather increased the level of challenge when performing our substantive procedures.
KEY OBSERVATIONS COMMUNICATED TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE We concluded that based on the facts and circumstances of the El Bajo ejido litigation and land disputes managements assessment that no provision is required and that the impacted assets are recoverable at 31 December 2017 is appropriate.
The legal confirmations we received supported managements judgements in this area.
We concluded that the carrying value of related assets is appropriate.
We consider that the disclosure in note 26 Contingencies is appropriate.
FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 KEY AUDIT MATTER RECOVERABLE AMOUNT OF MINING ASSETS The identification of indicators of impairment is judgmental.
When an impairment test is performed the key assumptions underpinning managements assessment of the recoverable amount of mining assets are reserves and resources and related mine plans and production profiles estimated future operating and capital expenditure future commodity prices exchange rates and the discount rates applied.
The estimation of mineral reserves and resources quantities of the Groups mines requires significant judgment and estimation.
The Groups reserves and resources are audited by SRK a specialist engaged by management.
Changes to assumptions could lead to material changes in estimated recoverable amounts resulting in impairment of property plant and equipment US2448.6 million 2016 US2180.2 million.
There is however no impairment taken prior years that may be reversed.
Our judgment is that the level of risk in this area remains consistent with the prior year .
We have not made significant changes to our audit response compared to the prior year .
Managements assessment of the judgement and estimation required is set out in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements with results of managements assessment for impairment in note 12.
The reserves and resources tables are presented on pages 274278 after the Parent Company notes.
OUR AUDIT RESPONSE We performed full scope audit procedures over this risk area in 4 components which covered 100% of the risk amount.
Indicators of impairment and methodology used to estimate recoverable values We reviewed managements identification of indicators of impairment under accounting standards.
We assessed the methodology used by management to estimate the recoverable value of each mining asset for which an impairment test was performed to ensure that this is consistent with accounting standards.
We have assessed the valuation models used by management to estimate the recoverable value of each asset.
Estimation process for reserves and resources We walked through the process of the estimation of the reserves and resources quantities.
We identified key controls in this process and obtained evidence of their implementation.
External specialists engaged by management We assessed SRK as a specialist engaged by management.
Through discussions with SRK we have gained an understanding of the scope of their work to verify that this was appropriate.
We read the report of the external specialist and gained an understanding of the changes in reserves and resources estimates in the year .
Use of reserves and resources in financial statement calculations We tested that the audited reserves and resources estimates have been appropriately applied to relevant areas of the Groups financial statements including in assessing the recoverable value of mining assets.
Key internal assumptions used in managements estimate of the recoverable values of mining assets We agreed related production profiles to the current mine plans for each mine and considered their consistency with our understanding of future plans at the mines obtained through interviews with both operating and senior management.
We assessed operating and capital costs included in the cash flow forecasts for consistency with current operating costs and forecast mine production.
Key external assumptions used in managements estimate of the recoverable values of mining assets Working with our valuation specialists we have assessed managements assumptions relating to future metals prices and discount rates comparing these to market data and also for consistency with other estimates used in the financial statements.
We have performed sensitivity analysis on managements calculated recoverable values for alternative assumptions around silver and gold prices and the discount rate applied.

KEY AUDIT MATTER KEY OBSERVATIONS COMMUNICATED TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE We assessed SRK as an appropriate specialist engaged by management for the purposes of auditing the reserves and resources of the Group.
We confirmed that the audited reserves and resources estimates have been appropriately used in relevant financial statement calculations.
We consider the approach to determining the recoverable value of mining assets tested for impairment to be appropriate.
Our procedures confirmed that the reserves and resources and related production profiles used in the impairment testing are consistent with the estimates audited by SRK and respective mine plans.
Our procedures confirmed that the estimates of operating and capital costs are consistent with the production profiles of respective mines and related mine plans.
We concluded that the carrying values of mining assets are recoverable at 31 December 2017.
KEY AUDIT MATTER POTENTIAL TAX UNCERTAINTIES ARISING FROM TAX AUTHORITY INSPECTIONS AND CHANGES IN LEGISLATION This is an area on which the audit team including senior members thereof has spent considerable time during the year as these areas have developed.
Constituent areas discussed below have not resulted in provisions at 31 December 2017 but are disclosed as contingent liabilities.
Tax authority inspections As disclosed in note 26 Contingencies in the consolidated financial statements in 2015 the tax authorities SAT initiated inspections of Minera Penmont for 2012 and 2013 which are ongoing.
During the current year SAT initiated a number of further inspections at certain of the Groups subsidiaries.
The Company has provided information to SAT with respect to the inspections initiated in the year .
However to date no findings have been raised by SAT.
Changes in legislation Effective 1 January 2017 there were changes in Mexican income tax and VAT requirements relating to contractors a significant area of expenditure for Fresnillo.
Fresnillo now has an obligation to ensure that contractors are compliant with their own tax obligations including employment tax.
If Fresnillo does not obtain and retain sufficient evidence of a contractors compliance the Company is at risk of not being permitted to deduct costs related to the contractor for income tax purposes or recover the related input VAT.
The tax authorities committed to establish an online portal to facilitate compliance.
This was only made available in December 2017.
As such there has been a lack of clarity around the implementation of the requirements for 2017 until late in the year .
In late 2017 the related legislation was updated to clarify that registration by a contractor on the online portal by the end of 2018 was sufficient to discharge any 2017 compliance obligations for Fresnillo.
Our judgment is that the level of risk in this area has increased compared with the prior year .
We have designed and executed specific audit responses to address the risk in the current year .
Contingencies in respect of taxation are disclosed in note 26 to the consolidated financial statements and the relevant accounting policies in note 2.
FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 KEY AUDIT MATTER OUR AUDIT RESPONSE We performed full scope audit procedures over this risk area in all impacted components which covered 100% of the risk amount.
Tax inspections  Throughout the year we maintained an understanding of the progress of inspections in order to understand the status of inspections started in 2015 as well as areas of information requested for new inspections and the status of subsequent correspondence with the tax authorities.
We read the correspondence with tax authorities relating to the tax inspections and where relevant legal opinions supporting tax treatments.
For elements of inspections that were progressed during the year we critically inspected correspondence with the SAT to substantiate managements views on any remaining exposure at 31 December 2017.
We evaluated managements process to determine any remaining exposure and likelihood of tax treatments being accepted by the tax authorities.
We read the related disclosures in the financial statements assessing whether they accurately reflect our understanding of the status of the investigations and managements assessment of potential exposure.
Contractors fiscal compliance Using our tax specialists we assessed the implications of the new legislation and its implementation as this evolved during the year .
We understood the Companys process for seeking compliance with the regulation and assessed its adequacy.
We held meetings with management to understand its progress in obtaining evidence of contractor compliance throughout the year .
On a sample basis we checked the evidence obtained by management in support of contractors compliance during 2017.
Following the clarification of legislation in late 2017 we assessed managements process to achieve contractor registration on the portal and the subsequent extent of actual registration.
Management override  As the evaluation of related controls requires the evaluation of the assumptions used in and the output of that process we do not seek to rely on these controls.
As such we did not specifically address the risk of management override of controls in this area but rather increased the level of challenge when performing our substantive procedures.
KEY OBSERVATIONS COMMUNICATED TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE We conclude that managements process for evaluating tax exposures is appropriate and that the conclusions reached are supportable.
We conclude that the disclosure of contingent liabilities is appropriate at 31 December 2017.

KEY AUDIT MATTER RECOVERABLE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES PARENT COMPANY ONLY Investments in subsidiaries US7094 million 2016 US6958 million are more sensitive to changes in recoverable value than the Groups underlying mining assets because these investments were remeasured at fair value in 2008 when the Group was established ahead of its Initial Public Offering.
The principal driver of the recoverable amount of investments in subsidiaries is the estimated value of underlying mining assets held by the Groups subsidiaries.
Refer to related considerations in the related key audit matter above.
In addition management estimates the recoverable value of exploration projects in considering the recoverable value of subsidiaries.
Changes to assumptions could lead to material changes in estimated recoverable amounts resulting in either impairment or reversals of impairment taken in prior years.
Our judgment is that the level of risk in this area remains consistent with the prior year .
We have not made significant changes to our audit response compared to the prior year .
Managements assessment of the judgement and estimation required is set out in note 2 to the Parent Company financial statements with managements assessment of investments in subsidiaries included in note 5.
OUR AUDIT RESPONSE We performed full scope audit procedures over this risk area in 1 component which covered 100% of the risk amount.
Key internal assumptions used in managements estimate of the recoverable value We have assessed the methodology used by management to estimate the recoverable value of each investment for which an impairment test was performed to ensure that this is consistent with accounting standards.
Refer to the key audit matter above with respect to procedures performed relating to the recoverable value of mining assets.
We have evaluated managements approach to valuing exploration prospects.
Key external assumptions used in managements estimate of the recoverable value Refer to the key audit matter above with respect to procedures performed relating to the recoverable value of mining assets.
We have performed sensitivity analysis on managements calculated recoverable values for alternative assumptions around silver and gold prices and the discount rate applied.
KEY OBSERVATIONS COMMUNICATED TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE We concluded that the carrying values of mining assets the principal driver of the recoverable amount of investments in subsidiaries are reasonable.
We agree with managements assessment of the recoverable value of investments in subsidiaries and related income statement effects in the year .
FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 PRINCIPAL CHANGES AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR ARE DETAILED BELOW In the prior year we identified Reserves and resources as a separate key audit matter .
In the current year we consider this as a component of a new Key Audit Matter The recoverable amount of mining assets and as a component of Recoverability of investment in subsidiaries.
In response to an increased number of tax inspections and changes to income tax and VAT in respect of contractors we identified a new Key Audit Matter Potential tax uncertainties arising from tax authority inspections and changes in legislation.
AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT TAILORING THE SCOPE Our assessment of audit risk our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for each entity within the Group.
Taken together this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
We take into account size risk profile and the organisation of the Group and the effectiveness of groupwide controls and other factors such as the results of the work of Internal Audit when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity.
We performed an audit of the complete financial information of 5 components 2016 5 full scope components which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics.
These components are the 4 operating mining units in Mexico and the Parent Company.
In some instances operating mining units include more than one operating mine the Fresnillo mining unit includes the Fresnillo and the San Julin mines and the Penmont mining unit includes the Herradura Noche Buena and Soldeda and Dipolos mines.
We also performed specified audit procedures on specific account balances in a further 5 components 2016 5.
The procedures were on those account balances within those components which we deemed to be significant either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile.
These accounts included taxation mine closure provisions property plant and equipment and cash and cash equivalents and all balances relating to the Silverstream contract.
The reporting components where we performed audit procedures represented
Full scope Specified procedures Other procedures Excludes sales Silverstream revaluation effects and gain on sale of concessions.
The audit scope of components at which we perform specified procedures may not include testing of all significant accounts of the component but will have contributed to the coverage reflected above.
The remaining components together represent an effect on the Groups Profit before tax excluding Silverstream revaluation effects and gain on disposal of concessions of less than 1% 2016 1% and 2% of total assets 2016 2%.
For these components we perform other procedures including analytical review and testing of consolidation journals and intercompany eliminations to respond to any potential risks of material misstatement in the Group financial statements.
CHANGES FROM THE PRIOR YEAR There were no significant changes in our scoping as compared to the prior year .

INVOLVEMENT WITH COMPONENT TEAMS All of the Groups significant operations are in Mexico and are audited by one local team under our direct supervision.
Work performed by Primary team One component team under our direct supervision Full scope components Parent Company Components on which specified audit procedures are performed Silverstream contract In respect of the valuation of the Silverstream contract we perform primary procedures directly.
The component team performs certain supporting procedures regarding cash receipts and the auditor of Peoles provides support in respect of procedures on the estimation of reserve and resource quantities and the related mine plan at the Sabinas mine.
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the components by us as the primary audit engagement team or by the component auditor operating under our instruction.
Of the 5 full scope components audit procedures were performed on 1 of these directly by the primary audit team.
For the 5 components at which specified procedures were performed where the work was performed by component auditors we determined the appropriate level of involvement to enable us to determine that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole.
The primary engagement team including the Senior Statutory Auditor visited Mexico four times during the audit during both the planning and execution phases with members of the team working with and supervising the component team in Mexico for a number of weeks over several visits.
These visits involved discussion and oversight of the component team audit approach consideration of any accounting and auditing issues arising from their work reviewing key audit working papers meeting with management and attending closing meetings.
In addition in the current year members of the primary engagement team including the Senior Statutory Auditor visited three of the groups mining operations.
This together with the additional procedures performed at Group level gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the Group financial statements.
Senior members of the component team attended a Global Team Planning Event in the planning phase of the audit the Post Interim Event after hard close procedures and interacted regularly with the local team between visits to Mexico as appropriate.
The primary engagement team is predominantly composed of Spanish speakers in order to further enhance our interactions with both the component team and management.
The primary team was responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process.
For certain procedures in particular areas involving significant judgement and heightened audit risk we performed work ourselves with support where required from the component team.
In other cases we reviewed key working papers including but not limited to the risk areas described above.
OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in forming our audit opinion.
MATERIALITY
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that individually or in the aggregate could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements.
Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.
US million
Concession sale Basis for materiality
FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 We determined materiality for the Group to be US31.0 million 2016 US29.2 million which is 5% 2016 5% of profit before tax prior to Silverstream revaluation effects and gain on sale of concessions a oneoff material item subject to roundings.
This is a consistent basis to 2016 there being no gain on sale of concessions in 2016.
We believe that this measure of profit represents one of the principal considerations for members of the Group particularly as the Silverstream revaluation effects are principally noncash in nature and the gain on sale of concession is a one off transaction.
During the course of our audit we reassessed initial materiality and updated its calculation for the actual financial results of the year .
This did not result in any changes to materiality.
We determined materiality for the Parent Company to be US70.5 million 2016 US59.3 million which is 1% of equity.
The materiality of the Parent Company is higher than that of the Group reflective of the Parent Companys primary role being that of a holding company.
PERFORMANCE MATERIALITY The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level.
It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments together with our assessment of the Groups overall control environment our judgement was that performance materiality was 75% 2016 75% of our planning materiality namely US23.2 million 2016 US21.9 million.
We based this judgement on factors including the past history of misstatements our ability to assess the likelihood of misstatements and the effectiveness of the internal control environment.
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality.
The performance materiality set for each component is based on the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component.
The performance materiality allocated to fullscope components in the current year is set out in the graph to the right.
Allocated performance materiality increased in respect of all components reflecting the overall performance of the Group and the individual contributions of the components to that performance.
Specifically in respect of the Fresnillo mining unit we note that the increase in performance materiality reflects the San Julin mine becoming fully operational during 2017.
The icons correspond to the key audit matters set out above.
Audit procedures in respect of the recoverable amount of investments in subsidiaries are performed at the performance materiality of the standalone parent financial statements.

REPORTING THRESHOLD An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of US1.5m 2016 US1.5m which is set at 5% of planning materiality as well as differences below that threshold that in our view warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
OTHER INFORMATION The other information comprises the information included in the annual report other than the financial statements and our auditors report thereon.
The directors are responsible for the other information.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements our responsibility is to read the other information and in doing so consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information.
If based on the work we have performed we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
In this context we also have nothing to report in regard to our responsibility to specifically address the following items in the other information and to report as uncorrected material misstatements of the other information where we conclude that those items meet the following conditions Fair balanced and understandable set out on page 169  the statement given by the directors that they consider the annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the groups performance business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit or Audit committee reporting set out on pages 134146  the section describing the work of the audit committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the audit committee or Directors statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code set out on page 122  the parts of the directors statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the companys compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code containing provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R 2 do not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
OPINIONS ON OTHER MATTERS PRESCRIBED BY THE COMPANIES ACT 2006 In our opinion the part of the directors remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit the information given in the strategic report and the directors report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements and the strategic report and the directors report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if in our opinion adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us or the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns or certain disclosures of directors remuneration specified by law are not made or we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS As explained more fully in the directors responsibilities statement set out on page 169 the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error .
In preparing the financial statements the directors are responsible for assessing the group and parent companys ability to continue as a going concern disclosing as applicable matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
AUDITORS RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditors report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs UK will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if individually or in the aggregate they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
The objectives of our audit in respect to fraud are to identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements due to fraud to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the assessed risks of material misstatement due to fraud through designing and implementing appropriate responses and to respond appropriately to fraud or suspected fraud identified during the audit.
However the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the entity and management.
Our approach was as follows We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the group.
We determined that the most significant which are directly relevant to specific assertions in the financial statements are those related to the reporting framework IFRS the Companies Act 2006 and UK Corporate Governance Code regulations impacting mining operations including mining laws environmental and labour regulations and tax and employee profit sharing requirements in Mexico.
We understood how Fresnillo plc is complying with those legal and regulatory frameworks by making enquiries to management internal audit those responsible for legal and compliance procedures and the company secretary.
We corroborated our enquiries through our review of board minutes and papers provided to the Audit Committee.
We assessed the susceptibility of the groups financial statements to material misstatement including how fraud might occur by meeting with management from various parts of the business to understand where it is considered there was a susceptibility of fraud.
We also considered performance targets and their propensity to influence on efforts made by management to manage earnings.
We considered the programs and controls that the group has established to address risks identified or that otherwise prevent deter and detect fraud and how senior management monitors those programs and controls.
Where the risk was considered to be higher we performed audit procedures to address each identified fraud risk.
These procedures included testing manual journals and were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements were free of fraud or error .
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Councils website at httpswww. rc. iteauditorsresponsibilities.
This description forms part of our auditors report.

OTHER MATTERS WE ARE REQUIRED TO ADDRESS Following a competitive tender process and the recommendation of the audit committee we were appointed as auditors by the shareholders and signed an engagement letter on 28 July 2017.
We were appointed by the company at the AGM on 4 May 2016 to audit the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2017 and subsequent financial periods.
The period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and reappointments is 10 years covering periods from our initial appointment in 2008 through to the year ended 31 December 2017.
In January 2017 we identified that nonaudit services related to December 2016 prohibited under the new FRC Ethical Standard had been undertaken.
These related to less than 10 hours of tax services related to payroll tax for an immaterial subsidiary of the group.
No amounts related to these services have been recognised in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017.
We therefore consider this to be a minor breach of the Ethical Standard and we do not consider our independence to be impaired.
We notified the Audit Committee of this breach in February 2017.
The Audit Committee agreed with our conclusion that the breach is minor and that our independence is not impaired.
The Committees discussion of this breach is set out on page 139.
The evaluation of whether our independence was impaired included consideration of the safeguards to independence in connection with the service specifically that the work was undertaken by a separate team from the audit team and responsibility for the related tax calculation was taken by a competent member of the groups management.
The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee.

Industrias Peoles S. de C.
Peoles currently owns 75% of the shares of the Company and the ultimate controlling party of the Company is the Baillres family whose beneficial interest is held through Peoles.
The registered address of Peoles is Calzada Legaria 549 Mexico City 11250.
Copies of Peoles accounts can be obtained from sitemx.
Further information on related party balances and transactions with Peoles group companies is disclosed in note 27.
The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2017 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors of Fresnillo plc on 26 February 2018.
The Groups principal business is the mining and beneficiation of nonferrous minerals and the sale of related production.
The primary contents of this production are silver gold lead and zinc.
Further information about the Group operating mines and its principal activities is disclosed in note 3.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES A BASIS OF PREPARATION AND CONSOLIDATION AND STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE BASIS OF PREPARATION AND STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE The Groups consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2016 and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments availableforsale financial assets and defined benefit pension scheme assets which have been measured at fair value.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in dollars of the United States of America US dollars or US and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand 000 except when otherwise indicated.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements set out the Groups financial position as of 31 December 2017 and 2016 and the results of operations and cash flows for the years then ended.
Entities that constitute the Group are those enterprises controlled by the Group regardless of the number of shares owned by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to or has the right to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
Entities are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations in accordance with IFRS 3.
All intraGroup balances transactions income and expenses and profits and losses including unrealised profits arising from intraGroup transactions have been eliminated on consolidation.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains except that they are only eliminated to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Noncontrolling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups equity therein.
The interest of noncontrolling shareholders may be initially measured either at fair value or at the noncontrolling interests proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets.
The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisitionby acquisition basis.
Subsequent to acquisition noncontrolling interests consist of the amount attributed to such interests at initial recognition and the noncontrolling interests share of changes in equity since the date of the combination.
Any losses of a subsidiary are attributed to the noncontrolling interests even if that results in a deficit balance.
Transactions with noncontrolling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions that is a transaction with the owners in their capacity as owners.
The difference between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity.
Gains or losses on disposals to noncontrolling interest are also recorded in equity.

B CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND DISCLOSURES The accounting policies applied are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016.
During 2017 there were no amendments to existing accounting policies.
NEW STANDARDS INTERPRETATIONS AND AMENDMENTS NEW STANDARDS ADOPTED BY THE GROUP The Group has adopted from 1 January 2017 Amendments to IAS 7.
The amendments require an entity to provide disclosures that enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities.
The Group also has adopted Amendments to IAS 12.
The amendments clarify the accounting for deferred tax where an asset is measured at fair value and that fair value is below the assets tax base.
They also clarify certain other aspects of accounting for deferred tax assets.
These amendments had no impact in the financial information of the Group.
Other than the above mentioned amendments there were no significant new standards that the Group was required to adopt effective from 1 January 2017.
STANDARDS INTERPRETATIONS AND AMENDMENTS ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE The standards and interpretations that are issued but not yet effective up to the date of issuance of the Groups financial statements are disclosed below.
The Group intends to adopt these standards as applicable to the Groups financial statements when they become effective except where indicated.
IFRS 9 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IFRS 9 Financial Instruments addresses the classification measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities introduces new rules for hedge accounting and a new impairment model for financial assets.
The Group has decided not to adopt IFRS 9 until it becomes mandatory on 1 January 2018.
The Group does not expect the new guidance to have a significant impact on the classification and measurement of its financial assets for the following reasons CLASSIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT The equity instruments that are currently classified as availableforsale financial assets satisfy the conditions for classification as at fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI.
Under IFRS 9 gains and losses accumulated in OCI are not recycled to the income statement.
There are no other significant changes to the accounting for these assets.
Also embedded derivatives resulting for the sales of goods as described in note 2p will be no longer separated from the host contract.
Instead the entire receivable will be measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Management does not expect this to result in a significant impact on the measurement of the receivable.
There will be no impact on the Groups accounting for financial liabilities as the new requirements only affect the accounting for financial liabilities that are designated at fair value through profit or loss and the Group does not have any such liabilities.
DERECOGNITION
The derecognition rules have been transferred from IAS 39 Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement and have not been changed.
HEDGE ACCOUNTING The new hedge accounting rules will align the accounting for hedging instruments more closely with the Groups risk management practices.
At this stage the Group does not expect to designate any new hedge relationships except for the derivatives corresponding to purchase of property plant and equipment.
The Groups existing hedge relationships qualify as continuing hedges upon the adoption of IFRS 9.
As a consequence the Group does not expect an impact on the accounting for its hedging relationships.
IFRS 9 changes the accounting requirements for the time value of purchased options where only the intrinsic value of such options has been designated as the hedging instrument.
In such cases changes in the time value of options are initially recognised in OCI.
Where the hedged item is transaction related amounts initially recognised in OCI related to the change in the time value of options are reclassified to profit or loss or as a basis adjustment to nonfinancial assets or liabilities upon maturity of the hedged item or in the case of a hedged item that realises over time the amounts initially recognised in OCI are amortised to profit or loss on a systematic and rational basis over the life of the hedged item.
Under IAS 39 the change in time value of options is recorded in the income statement.
The initial credit adjustment from retained earnings to hedging reserve as at 1 January 2017 would be US23.0 million and the adjustment decreasing financial cost for the year ended 31 December 2017 US42.1 million.
FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED B CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND DISCLOSURES CONTINUED
IFRS 9 requires the Group to now use an expected credit loss model for its trade receivables measured at amortised cost either on a 12month or lifetime basis.
Given the shortterm nature of these receivables the Group does not expect these changes will have a significant impact.
PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE The new standard also introduces expanded disclosure requirements and changes in presentation.
These are expected to change the nature and extent of the Groups disclosures about its financial instruments particularly in the year of the adoption of the new standard.
IFRS 15 REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS The IASB has issued a new standard for the recognition of revenue arising from contracts with customers.
The new revenue standard will supersede all current revenue recognition requirements under IFRS.
The new standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognised when control of a good or service transfers to a customer .
The Group has evaluated recognition and measurement of revenue based on the fivestep model in IFRS 15 and has not identified any financial impacts hence no adjustments are expected to result from the adoption of IFRS 15.
The Group has elected to adopt the new standard from 1 January 2018 applying the modified retrospective adoption method.
Certain disclosures will change as a result of the requirements of IFRS 15.
The Group expects this to include a breakdown of revenue from customers and revenue from other sources including the movement in the value of embedded derivatives in sales contracts.
IFRS 16 LEASES IFRS 16 introduces a single lessee accounting model and requires a lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 months unless the underlying asset is of low value.
A lessee is required to recognise a rightofuse asset representing its right to use the underlying leased asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments.
IFRS 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in IAS 17.
Accordingly a lessor continues to classify its leases as operating leases or finance leases and to account for those two types of leases differently.
These amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and earlier application is permitted.
However as there are several interactions between IFRS 16 and IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers early application is restricted to entities that also early adopt IFRS 15.
The Group has decided to adopt the standard when it becomes effective.
IFRIC 22 FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS AND ADVANCE CONSIDERATION IFRIC 22 clarifies which exchange rate to use in reporting foreign currency transactions when payment is made or received in advance.
The interpretation requires the company to determine a date of transaction for the purposes of selecting an exchange rate to use on initial recognition of the related asset expense or income.
In the case that there are multiple payments or receipts in advance the entity should determine a date of the transaction for each flow of advance consideration.
IFRIC 22 is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and earlier adoption is permitted.
The interpretation is not expected to have any impact in the financial information of the Group.
IFRIC 23 UNCERTAINTY OVER INCOME TAX TREATMENTS This Interpretation clarifies how to apply the recognition and measurement requirements in IAS 12 when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments.
The interpretation is to be applied to the determination of taxable profit tax loss tax bases unused tax losses unused tax credits and tax rates when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments.
Application of tax law can be complex and requires judgement to assess risk and estimate outcomes where the amount of tax payable or recoverable is uncertain.
The Group is working to identify potential uncertainties based on previous resolutions of tax authorities.
IFRIC 23 is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and earlier adoption is permitted.
The Group has not early adopted any standard interpretation or amendment that was issued but is not yet effective.

C SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS The preparation of the Groups consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
These judgements and estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances with regard to prior experience but actual results may differ from the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements.
Information about such judgements and estimates is contained in the accounting policies andor the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
JUDGEMENTS
Areas of judgement apart from those involving estimations that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements are Determination of functional currency note 2d The determination of functional currency requires management judgement particularly where there may be more than one currency in which transactions are undertaken and which impact the economic environment in which the entity operates.
Evaluation of the status of projects note 2e The evaluation of project status impacts the accounting for costs incurred and requires management judgement.
This includes the assessment of whether there is sufficient evidence of the probability of the existence of economically recoverable minerals to justify the commencement of capitalisation of costs the timing of the end of the exploration phase and the start of the development phase and the commencement of the production phase.
These judgements directly impact the treatment of costs incurred and proceeds from the sale of metals from ore produced.
Stripping costs note 2e The Group incurs waste removal costs stripping costs during the development and production phases of its surface mining operations.
During the production phase stripping costs production stripping costs can be incurred both in relation to the production of inventory in that period and the creation of improved access and mining flexibility in relation to ore to be mined in the future.
The former are included as part of the costs of inventory while the latter are capitalised as a stripping activity asset where certain criteria are met.
Once the Group has identified production stripping for a surface mining operation judgement is required in identifying the separate components of the ore bodies for that operation to which stripping costs should be allocated.
Generally a component is a specific volume of the ore body that is made more accessible by the stripping activity.
In identifying components of the ore body the Group works closely with the mining operations personnel to analyse each of the mine plans.
The mine plans and therefore the identification of components will vary between mines for a number of reasons.
These include but are not limited to the type of commodity the geological characteristics of the ore body the geographical location andor financial considerations.
The Group reassesses the components of ore bodies annually in line with the preparation of mine plans.
In the current year this reassessment did not give rise to any changes in the identification of components.
Once production stripping costs have been identified judgement is also required to identify a suitable production measure to be used to allocate production stripping costs between inventory and any stripping activity assets for each component.
The Group considers that the ratio of the expected tonnes of waste to be stripped for an expected tonnes of ore to be mined for a specific component of the ore body is the most suitable production measure.
Furthermore judgements and estimates are also used to apply the units of production method in determining the depreciable lives of the stripping activity assets.
Qualifying assets note 2e All interestbearing loans are held by the parent company and were not obtained for any specific assets acquisition construction or production.
Funds from these loans are transferred to subsidiaries to meet the strategic objectives of the Group or are otherwise held centrally.
Due to this financing structure judgement is required in determining whether those borrowings are attributable to the acquisition construction or production of a qualifying asset.
Therefore management determines whether borrowings are attributable to an asset or group of assets based on whether the investment in an operating or development stage project is classified as contributing to achieving the strategic growth of the Group.
Contingencies note 26.
By their nature contingencies will be resolved only when one or more uncertain future events occur or fail to occur .
The assessment of the existence and potential quantum of contingencies inherently involves the exercise of significant judgement and the use of estimates regarding the outcome of future events.
FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED C SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS CONTINUED ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS Significant areas of estimation uncertainty considered by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements include Estimated recoverable ore reserves and mineral resources note 2e Ore reserves are estimates of the amount of ore that can be economically and legally extracted from the Groups mining properties mineral resources are an identified mineral occurrence with reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction.
The Group estimates its ore reserves and mineral resources based on information compiled by appropriately qualified persons relating to the geological and technical data on the size depth shape and grade of the ore body and suitable production techniques and recovery rates in conformity with the Joint Ore Reserves Committee JORC code 2012.
Such an analysis requires complex geological judgements to interpret the data.
The estimation of recoverable ore reserves and mineral resources is based upon factors such as geological assumptions and judgements made in estimating the size and grade of the ore body estimates of commodity prices foreign exchange rates future capital requirements and production costs.
As additional geological information is produced during the operation of a mine the economic assumptions used and the estimates of ore reserves and mineral resources may change.
Such changes may impact the Groups reported balance sheet and income statement including The carrying value of property plant and equipment and mining properties may be affected due to changes in estimated future cash flows which consider both ore reserves and mineral resources Depreciation and amortisation charges in the income statement may change where such charges are determined using the unitofproduction method based on ore reserves Stripping costs capitalised in the balance sheet either as part of mine properties or inventory or charged to profit or loss may change due to changes in stripping ratios Provisions for mine closure costs may change where changes to the ore reserve and resources estimates affect expectations about when such activities will occur and The recognition and carrying value of deferred income tax assets may change due to changes regarding the existence of such assets and in estimates of the likely recovery of such assets.
Determination of useful lives of assets for depreciation and amortisation purposes notes 2e and 12 Estimates are required to be made by management as to the useful lives of assets.
For depreciation calculated under the unitofproduction method estimated recoverable reserves are used in determining the depreciation andor amortisation of minespecific assets.
The depreciationamortisation charge is proportional to the depletion of the estimated remaining life of mine of production.
Estimated useful lives of other assets are based on the expected usage of the asset.
Each items life which is assessed annually has regard to both its physical life limitations and to expectations of the use of the asset by the Group including with reference to present assessments of economically recoverable reserves of the mine property at which the asset is used.
Silverstream note 14 The valuation of the Silverstream contract as a derivative financial instrument requires estimation by management.
The term of the derivative is based on Sabinas life of mine and the value of this derivative is determined using a number of estimates including the estimated recoverable ore reserves and mineral resources and future production profile of the Sabinas mine the estimated recoveries of silver from ore mined estimates of the future price of silver and the discount rate used to discount future cash flows.
For further details on the inputs that have a significant effect on the fair value of this derivative see note 30.
The impact of changes in silver price assumptions foreign exchange inflation and the discount rate is included in note 31.
Assessment of recoverability of property plant and equipment and impairment charges note 2f The recoverability of an asset requires the use of estimates and assumptions such as longterm commodity prices reserves and resources and the associated production profiles discount rates future capital requirements exploration potential and operating performance.
Changes in these assumptions will affect the recoverable amount of the property plant and equipment.
Estimation of the mine closure costs notes 2l and 21 Significant estimates and assumptions are made in determining the provision for mine closure cost as there are numerous factors that will affect the ultimate liability payable.
These factors include estimates of the extent and costs of rehabilitation activities the currency in which the cost will be incurred technological changes regulatory changes cost increases mine life and changes in discount rates.
Those uncertainties may result in future actual expenditure differing from the amounts currently provided.
The provision at the balance sheet date represents managements best estimate of the present value of the future closure costs required.

Income tax notes 2r and 10 The recognition of deferred tax assets including those arising from unutilised tax losses require management to assess the likelihood that the Group will generate taxable earnings in future periods in order to utilise recognised deferred tax assets.
Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecast cash flows from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction.
To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates the ability of the Group to realise the net deferred tax assets recorded at the balance sheet date could be impacted.
D FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION The Groups consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars which is the parent companys functional currency.
The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined by the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
For all operating entities this is US dollars.
Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All differences that arise are recorded in the income statement.
Nonmonetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions.
Nonmonetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into US dollars using the exchange rate at the date when the fair value is determined.
For entities with functional currencies other than US dollars as at the reporting date assets and liabilities are translated into the reporting currency of the Group by applying the exchange rate at the balance sheet date and the income statement is translated at the average exchange rate for the year .
The resulting difference on exchange is included as a cumulative translation adjustment in other comprehensive income.
On disposal of an entity the deferred cumulative amount recognised in other comprehensive income relating to that operation is recognised in the income statement.
E PROPERTY PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment if any.
Cost comprises the purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into working condition for its intended use.
The cost of selfconstructed assets includes the cost of materials direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads.
The cost less the residual value of each item of property plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life.
Each items estimated useful life has been assessed with regard to both its own physical life limitations and the present assessment of economically recoverable reserves of the mine property at which the item is located.
Estimates of remaining useful lives are made on a regular basis for all mine buildings machinery and equipment with annual reassessments for major items.
Depreciation is charged to cost of sales on a unitofproduction UOP basis for mine buildings and installations plant and equipment used in the mine production process or on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the individual asset when not related to the mine production process.
Changes in estimates which mainly affect unitofproduction calculations are accounted for prospectively.
Depreciation commences when assets are available for use.
Land is not depreciated.
The expected useful lives are as follows
Buildings 6 Plant and equipment 4 Mining properties and development costs Other assets 3 1 Depreciation of mining properties and development cost are determined using the unitofproduction method.
An item of property plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal.
Any gain or loss arising at derecognition of the asset calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset is included in the income statement in the year that the asset is derecognised.
Noncurrent assets or disposal groups are classified as held for sale when it is expected that the carrying amount of the asset will be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use.
Assets are not depreciated when classified as held for sale.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED D FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION CONTINUED DISPOSAL OF ASSETS Gains or losses from the disposal of assets are recognised in the income statement when all significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer usually when title has been passed.
MINING PROPERTIES AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS Payments for mining concessions are expensed during the exploration phase of a prospect and capitalised during the development of the project when incurred.
Purchased rights to ore reserves and mineral resources are recognised as assets at their cost of acquisition or at fair value if purchased as part of a business combination.
Mining concessions when capitalised are amortised on a straight line basis over the period of time in which benefits are expected to be obtained from that specific concession.
Mine development costs are capitalised as part of property plant and equipment.
Mine development activities commence once a feasibility study has been performed for the specific project.
When an exploration prospect has entered into the advanced exploration phase and sufficient evidence of the probability of the existence of economically recoverable minerals has been obtained preoperative expenses relating to mine preparation works are also capitalised as a mine development cost.
The initial cost of a mining property comprises its construction cost any costs directly attributable to bringing the mining property into operation the initial estimate of the provision for mine closure cost and for qualifying assets borrowing costs.
The Group cease the capitalisation of borrowing cost when the physical construction of the asset is complete and is ready for its intended use.
Revenues from metals recovered from ore mined in the mine development phase prior to commercial production are credited to mining properties and development costs.
Upon commencement of production capitalised expenditure is depreciated using the unitofproduction method based on the estimated economically proven and probable reserves to which they relate.
Mining properties and mine development are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment in value if any.
CONSTRUCTION IN PROGRESS Assets in the course of construction are capitalised as a separate component of property plant and equipment.
On completion the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category of property plant and equipment.
The cost of construction in progress is not depreciated.
SUBSEQUENT EXPENDITURES All subsequent expenditure on property plant and equipment is capitalised if it meets the recognition criteria and the carrying amount of those parts that are replaced is derecognised.
All other expenditure including repairs and maintenance expenditure is recognised in the income statement as incurred.
STRIPPING COSTS In a surface mine operation it is necessary to remove overburden and other waste material in order to gain access to the ore bodies stripping activity.
During development and preproduction phases the stripping activity costs are capitalised as part of the initial cost of development and construction of the mine the stripping activity asset and charged as depreciation or depletion to cost of sales in the income statement based on the mines units of production once commercial operations begin.
Removal of waste material normally continues throughout the life of a surface mine.
At the time that saleable material begins to be extracted from the surface mine the activity is referred to as production stripping.
Production stripping cost is capitalised only if the following criteria is met It is probable that the future economic benefits improved access to an ore body associated with the stripping activity will flow to the Group The Group can identify the component of an ore body for which access has been improved and The costs relating to the improved access to that component can be measured reliably.
If not all of the criteria are met the production stripping costs are charged to the income statement as operating costs as they are incurred.

STATEMENTS
Stripping activity costs associated with such development activities are capitalised into existing mining development assets as mining properties and development cost within property plant and equipment using a measure that considers the volume of waste extracted compared with expected volume for a given volume of ore production.
This measure is known as component stripping ratio which is revised annually in accordance with the mine plan.
The amount capitalised is subsequently depreciated over the expected useful life of the identified component of the ore body related to the stripping activity asset by using the units of production method.
The identification of components and the expected useful lives of those components are evaluated annually.
Depreciation is recognised as cost of sales in the income statement.
The capitalised stripping activity asset is carried at cost less accumulated depletiondepreciation less impairment if any.
Cost includes the accumulation of costs directly incurred to perform the stripping activity that improves access to the identified component of ore plus an allocation of directly attributable overhead costs.
The costs associated with incidental operations are excluded from the cost of the stripping activity asset.
In identifying components of the ore body the Group works closely with the mining operations personnel for each mining operation to analyse each of the mine plans.
Generally a component will be a subset of the total ore body and a mine may have several components that are identified based on the mine plan.
The mine plans and therefore the identification of components can vary between mines for a number of reasons including but not limited to the type of commodity the geological characteristics of the ore body the geographical location andor financial considerations.
F IMPAIRMENT OF NONFINANCIAL ASSETS The carrying amounts of nonfinancial assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
At each reporting date an assessment is made to determine whether there are any indications of impairment.
If there are indicators of impairment an exercise is undertaken to determine whether carrying values are in excess of their recoverable amount.
Such reviews are undertaken on an asset by asset basis except where such assets do not generate cash flows independent of those from other assets or groups of assets and then the review is undertaken at the cash generating unit level.
If the carrying amount of an asset or its cash generating unit exceeds the recoverable amount a provision is recorded to reflect the asset at the recoverable amount in the balance sheet.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
THE RECOVERABLE AMOUNT OF AN ASSET The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its value in use and fair value less costs of disposal.
In assessing value in use estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
Fair value less cost of disposal is based on an estimate of the amount that the Group may obtain in an orderly sale transaction between market participants.
For an asset that does not generate cash inflows largely independently of those from other assets or groups of assets the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
The Groups cash generating units are the smallest identifiable groups of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
REVERSAL OF IMPAIRMENT An assessment is made each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such an indication exists the Group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the impairment loss was recognised.
If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the recoverable amount.
That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined net of depreciation had no impairment loss been recognised in previous years.
Such impairment loss reversal is recognised in the income statement.
G FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Financial assets are recognised when the Group becomes party to contracts that give rise to them and are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss held to maturity investments availableforsale financial assets or loans and receivables or derivatives designated as hedging instruments as appropriate.
The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and reevaluates this designation at each balance sheet date.
When financial assets are recognised initially they are measured at fair value plus in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss directly attributable transaction costs.
The Group recognises financial liabilities on its balance sheet when and only when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial liabilities are classified at fair value through profit or loss loans and borrowings payables or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge as appropriate.
All financial liabilities are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received including any transaction costs incurred.
FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED G FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CONTINUED FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS Financial assets and liabilities classified as heldfortrading and other assets or liabilities designated as fair value through profit or loss at inception are included in this category.
Financial assets or liabilities are classified as heldfortrading if they are acquired or incurred for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the short term.
Derivatives including separated embedded derivatives are also classified as heldfortrading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments as defined by IAS 39.
Financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses arising from changes in fair value presented as finance costs or finance income in the income statement.
LOANS AND RECEIVABLES Loans and receivables are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or available forsale.
After initial measurement such assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any allowance for impairment.
Gains or losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired as well as through the amortisation process.
Current trade receivables are carried at the original invoice amount less provision made for impairment of these receivables.
Noncurrent receivables are stated at amortised cost.
Loans and receivables from contractors are carried at amortised cost.
LOANS AND BORROWINGS After initial recognition at fair value net of directly attributable transaction costs interestbearing loans are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate EIR method.
The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the income statement.
Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process.
The Group adjusts the carrying amount of the financial liability to reflect actual and revised estimated cash flows.
The carrying amount is recalculated by computing the present value of estimated future cash flows at the financial instruments original effective interest rate or when applicable the revised effective interest rate.
Any adjustment is recognised in profit or loss as income or expense.
This category generally applies to interestbearing loans and borrowings.
For more information refer to note 20.
AVAILABLEFORSALE FINANCIAL ASSETS Availableforsale financial assets are those nonderivative financial assets that are designated as such or are not classified in any of the preceding categories and are not held to maturity investments.
Availableforsale financial assets represent equity investments that have a quoted market price in an active market therefore a fair value can be reliably measured.
After initial measurement availableforsale financial assets are measured at fair value with marktomarket unrealised gains or losses recognised as other comprehensive income in the availableforsale reserve until the financial asset is derecognised.
Financial assets classified as availableforsale are derecognised when they are sold and all the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.
When financial assets are sold the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised in other comprehensive income are included in the income statement within other operating income or expense.
DERECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES A financial asset or liability is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled sold cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss.
The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability or part of a financial liability extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid including any noncash assets transferred or liabilities assumed is recognised in the income statement.

H IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
ASSETS CARRIED AT AMORTISED COST If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortised cost has been incurred the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows excluding future expected credit losses that have not been incurred discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate i. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account.
The amount of the loss is recognised in profit or loss.
The Group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant and individually or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant.
If it is determined that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset whether significant or not the asset is included in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and that group of financial assets is collectively assessed for impairment.
Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognised are not included in a collective assessment of impairment.
If in a subsequent period the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed.
Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date.
In relation to trade receivables a provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor that the Group will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of the invoice.
The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account.
Impaired receivables are de recognised when they are assessed as uncollectible.
AVAILABLEFORSALE FINANCIAL ASSETS If an availableforsale financial asset is impaired an amount comprising the difference between its cost net of any principal payment and amortisation and its current fair value less any impairment loss previously recognised in the income statement is transferred from equity to the income statement.
In assessing whether there is an impairment the Group considers whether a decline in fair value is either significant or prolonged by considering the size of the decline in this value the historic volatility in changes in fair value and the duration of the sustained decline.
Reversals in respect of equity instruments classified as availableforsale are not recognised in the income statement.
I INVENTORIES Finished goods work in progress and ore stockpile inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined using the weighted average cost method based on cost of production which excludes borrowing costs.
For this purpose the costs of production include personnel expenses which include employee profit sharing materials and contractor expenses which are directly attributable to the extraction and processing of ore the depreciation of property plant and equipment used in the extraction and processing of ore and related production overheads based on normal operating capacity.
Operating materials and spare parts are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
An allowance for obsolete and slowmoving inventories is determined by reference to specific items of stock.
A regular review is undertaken by management to determine the extent of such an allowance.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less any further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
J SHORTTERM INVESTMENTS Where the Group invests in shortterm instruments which are either not readily convertible into known amounts of cash or are subject to risk of changes in value that are not insignificant these instruments are classified as shortterm investments.
Shortterm investments are classified as loans and receivables.
FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED K CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS For the purposes of the balance sheet cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank cash on hand and shortterm deposits held with banks that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
Shortterm deposits earn interest at the respective shortterm deposit rates between one day and four months.
For the purposes of the cash flow statement cash and cash equivalents as defined above are shown net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
L PROVISIONS MINE CLOSURE COST A provision for mine closure cost is made in respect of the estimated future costs of closure restoration and for environmental rehabilitation costs which include the dismantling and demolition of infrastructure removal of residual materials and remediation of disturbed areas based on a mine closure plan in the accounting period when the related environmental disturbance occurs.
The provision is discounted and the unwinding of the discount is included within finance costs.
At the time of establishing the provision a corresponding asset is capitalised where it gives rise to a future economic benefit and is depreciated over future production from the mine to which it relates.
The provision is reviewed on an annual basis by the Group for changes in cost estimates discount rates or life of operations.
Changes to estimated future costs are recognised in the balance sheet by adjusting the mine closure cost liability and the related asset originally recognised.
If for mature mines the revised mine assets net of mine closure cost provisions exceed the recoverable value the portion of the increase is charged directly as an expense.
For closed sites changes to estimated costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss.
M EMPLOYEE BENEFITS The Group operates the following plans DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN This funded plan is based on each employees earnings and years of service.
This plan was open to all employees in Mexico until it was closed to new entrants on 1 July 2007.
The plan is denominated in Mexican Pesos.
For members as at 30 June 2007 benefits were frozen at that date subject to indexation with reference to the Mexican National Consumer Price Index NCPI.
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plan is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method and prepared by an external actuarial firm as at each yearend balance sheet date.
The discount rate is the yield on bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Groups obligations and that are denominated in the same currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid.
Actuarial gains or losses are recognised in OCI and permanently excluded from profit or loss.
Past service costs are recognised as an expense on a straight line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
If the benefits have already vested following the introduction of or changes to a pension plan the past service cost is recognised immediately.
The defined benefit asset or liability comprises the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly.
The value of any asset is restricted to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in the future contributions to the plan.
Net interest cost is recognised in finance cost and return on plan assets other than amounts reflected in net interest cost is recognised in OCI and permanently excluded from profit or loss.
DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PENSION PLAN A defined contribution plan is a postemployment benefit plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in profit or loss when they are due.
The contributions are based on the employees salary.
This plan started on 1 July 2007 and it is voluntary for all employees to join this scheme.

SENIORITY PREMIUM FOR VOLUNTARY SEPARATION This unfunded plan corresponds to an additional payment over the legal seniority premium equivalent to approximately 12 days of salary per year for those unionised workers who have more than 15 years of service.
Nonunionised employees with more than 15 years of service have the right to a payment equivalent to 12 days for each year of service.
For both cases the payment is based on the legal current minimum salary.
The cost of providing benefits for the seniority premium for voluntary separation is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method and prepared by an external actuarial firm as at each yearend balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains or losses are recognised as income or expense in the period in which they occur .
OTHER
Benefits for death and disability are covered through insurance policies.
Termination payments for involuntary retirement dismissals are charged to the income statement when incurred.
N EMPLOYEE PROFIT SHARING In accordance with the Mexican legislation companies in Mexico are subject to pay for employee profit sharing PTU equivalent to 10% of the taxable income of each fiscal year .
PTU is accounted for as employee benefits and is calculated based on the services rendered by employees during the year considering their most recent salaries.
The liability is recognised as it accrues and is charged to the income statement.
PTU paid in each fiscal year is considered deductible for income tax purposes.
O LEASES The determination of whether an arrangement is or contains a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at inception date including whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.
A reassessment is made after inception of the lease only if one of the following applies a There is a change in contractual terms other than a renewal or extension of the arrangement b A renewal option is exercised or extension granted unless the term of the renewal or extension was initially included in the lease term c There is a change in the determination of whether fulfilment is dependent on a specified asset or d There is a substantial change to the asset.
GROUP AS A LESSEE Finance leases which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or if lower at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are reflected in the income statement.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
GROUP AS A LESSOR Leases where the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental income.
Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in the period in which they are earned.
Where a reassessment is made lease accounting commences or ceases from the date when the change in circumstances gave rise to the reassessment for scenarios a c or d and at the date of renewal or extension period for scenario b above.
For arrangements entered into prior to 1 January 2005 the date of inception is deemed to be 1 January 2007 in accordance with the transitional requirements of IFRIC 4.
FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED P REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received excluding discounts rebates and other sales taxes.
SALE OF GOODS Revenue is recognised in the income statement when all significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer usually when title has been passed.
Revenue excludes any applicable sales taxes.
The Group recognises revenue on a provisional basis at the time concentrates precipitates and dor bars are delivered to the customers smelter or refinery using the Groups best estimate of contained metal.
Revenue is subject to adjustment once the analysis of the product samples is completed contract conditions have been fulfilled and final settlement terms are agreed.
Any subsequent adjustments to the initial estimate of metal content are recorded in revenue once they have been determined.
In addition sales of concentrates and precipitates throughout each calendar month as well as dor bars that are delivered after the 20th day of each month are provisionally priced subject to a final adjustment based on the average price for the month following the delivery to the customer based on the market price at the relevant quotation point stipulated in the contract.
Dor bars that are delivered in the first 20 days of each month are finally priced in the month of delivery.
For sales of goods that are subject to provisional pricing revenue is initially recognised when the conditions set out above have been met using the provisional price.
The price exposure is considered to be an embedded derivative and hence separated from the sales contract.
At each reporting date the provisionally priced metal is revalued based on the forward selling price for the quotation period stipulated in the contract until the quotation period ends.
The selling price of the metals can be reliably measured as these are actively traded on international exchanges.
The revaluing of provisionally priced contracts is recorded as an adjustment to revenue.
The customer deducts treatment and refining charges before settlement.
Therefore the fair value of consideration received for the sale of goods is net of those charges.
The Group recognises in selling expenses a levy in respect of the Extraordinary Mining Right as sales of gold and silver are recognised.
The Extraordinary Mining Right consists of a 0.5% rate applicable to the owners of mining titles.
The payment must be calculated over the total sales of all mining concessions.
The payment of this mining right must be remitted no later than the last business day of March of the following year and can be credited against corporate income tax.
The Group also recognises in selling expenses a discovery premium royalty equivalent to 1% of the value of the mineral extracted and sold during the year from certain mining titles granted by the Mexican Geological Survey SGM in the San Julin mine.
The premium is settled to SGM on a quarterly basis.
OTHER INCOME Other income is recognised in the income statement when all significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer usually when title has been passed.
Q EXPLORATION EXPENSES Exploration activity involves the search for mineral resources the determination of technical feasibility and the assessment of commercial viability of an identified resource.
Exploration expenses are charged to the income statement as incurred and are recorded in the following captions Cost of sales costs relating to inmine exploration that ensure continuous extraction quality and extend mine life and Exploration expenses Costs incurred in geographical proximity to existing mines in order to replenish or increase reserves and Costs incurred in regional exploration with the objective of locating new ore deposits in Mexico and Latin America and which are identified by project.
Costs incurred are charged to the income statement until there is sufficient probability of the existence of economically recoverable minerals and a feasibility study has been performed for the specific project.

R TAXATION CURRENT INCOME TAX Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in the country the Group operates.
DEFERRED INCOME TAX Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except Where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and at the time of transaction affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit loss and In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries associates and interests in joint ventures where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except Where the deferred income tax asset relating to deductible temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss and In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries associates and interests in joint ventures deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax relating to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
MINING RIGHTS The Special Mining Right is considered an income tax under IFRS and states that the owners of mining titles and concessions are subject to pay an annual mining right of 7.5% of the profit derived from the extractive activities.
The Group recognises deferred tax assets and liabilities on temporary differences arising in the determination of the Special Mining Right see note 10.
SALES TAX Expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax except When the sales tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority in which case the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable and When receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales tax included.
The net amount of sales tax recoverable from or payable to the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the balance sheet.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED S DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING The Group uses derivatives to reduce certain market risks derived from changes in foreign exchange and commodities price which impact its financial and business transactions.
Hedges are designed to protect the value of expected production against the dynamic market conditions.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
The full fair value of a derivative is classified as noncurrent asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the item is more than 12 months.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to the income statement.
Derivatives are valued using valuation approaches and methodologies such as Black Scholes and Net Present Value applicable to the specific type of derivative instrument.
The fair value of forward currency and commodity contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles European foreign exchange options are valued using the Black Scholes model.
The Silverstream contract is valued using a Net Present Value valuation approach.
At the inception of a hedge relationship the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Group wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for the undertaken hedge.
The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument the hedged item or transaction the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity will assess the hedging instruments effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged items fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk.
Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated.
Hedges which meet the strict criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows CASH FLOW HEDGES For derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recorded as in other comprehensive income and are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss such as when a forecast sale or purchase occurs.
For gains or losses related to the hedging of foreign exchange risk these are included in the line item in which the hedged costs are reflected.
Where the hedged item is the cost of a nonfinancial asset or liability the amounts recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the nonfinancial asset or liability.
The ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges is recognised directly as finance costs in the income statement of the related period.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover or if its designation as a hedge is revoked any cumulative gain or loss recognised directly in other comprehensive income from the period that the hedge was effective remains separately in other comprehensive income until the forecast transaction occurs when it is recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in other comprehensive income is immediately transferred to the income statement.
When hedging with options the Group designates only the intrinsic value movement of the hedging option within the hedge relationship.
The time value of the option contracts is therefore excluded from the hedge designation.
Changes in fair value of time value is recognised in the income statement in finance costs.
EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES Contracts are assessed for the existence of embedded derivatives at the date that the Group first becomes party to the contract with reassessment only if there is a change to the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows.
Embedded derivatives which are not clearly and closely related to the underlying asset liability or transaction are separated and accounted for as standalone derivatives.

T BORROWING COSTS Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes 12 or more months to get ready for its intended use or sale a qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost of the respective asset.
Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.
Where funds are borrowed specifically to finance a project the amount capitalised represents the actual borrowing costs incurred.
Where surplus funds are available for a short term from funds borrowed specifically to finance a project the income generated from the temporary investment of such amounts is also capitalised and deducted from the total capitalised borrowing cost.
Where the funds used to finance a project form part of general borrowings the amount capitalised is calculated using a weighted average of rates applicable to relevant general borrowings of the Group during the period.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
U FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT The Group measures financial instruments at fair value at each balance sheet date.
Fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed in notes 30 and 31.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either In the principal market for the asset or liability or In the absence of a principal market in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the Group.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.
A fair value measurement of a nonfinancial asset takes into account a market participants ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy described as follows based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole Level 1  Quoted unadjusted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2  Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
Level 3  Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by reassessing categorisation based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole at the end of each reporting period.
For the purpose of fair value disclosures the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.
Further information on fair values is described in note 30.
V DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTION Dividends payable to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability when these are approved by the Companys shareholders or Board as appropriate.
Dividends payable to minority shareholders are recognised as a liability when these are approved by the Companys subsidiaries.
FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SEGMENT REPORTING For management purposes the Group is organised into operating segments based on producing mines.
At 31 December 2017 the Group has seven reportable operating segments as follows The Fresnillo mine located in the state of Zacatecas an underground silver mine The Saucito mine located in the state of Zacatecas an underground silver mine The Cinega mine located in the state of Durango an underground gold mine including the San Ramn satellite mine The Herradura mine located in the state of Sonora a surface gold mine The SoledadDipolos mine located in the state of Sonora a surface gold mine The Noche Buena mine located in state of Sonora a surface gold mine and The San Julin mine located on the border of ChihuahuaDurango states an underground silvergold mine.
Phase one of San Julin mine commenced commercial production in the third quarter of 2016 and phase two in the third quarter of 2017.
The operating performance and financial results for each of these mines are reviewed by management.
As the Groups chief operating decisionmaker does not review segment assets and liabilities the Group has not disclosed this information.
Management monitors the results of its operating segments separately for the purpose of performance assessment and making decisions about resource allocation.
Segment performance is evaluated without taking into account certain adjustments included in revenue as reported in the consolidated income statement and certain costs included within cost of sales and gross profit which are considered to be outside of the control of the operating management of the mines.
The table below provides a reconciliation from segment profit to gross profit as per the consolidated income statement.
Other income and expenses included in the consolidated income statement are not allocated to operating segments.
Transactions between reportable segments are accounted for on an arms length basis similar to transactions with third parties.
In 2017 and 2016 substantially all revenue was derived from customers based in Mexico.

INCOME TAX EXPENSE CONTINUED E CORPORATE INCOME TAX IMPUESTO SOBRE LA RENTA OR ISR AND SPECIAL MINING RIGHT SMR The Groups principal operating subsidiaries are Mexican residents for taxation purposes.
The rate of current corporate income tax is 30%.
During 2016 the Mexican Internal Revenue Law granted to taxpayers a credit in respect of an excise tax Special Tax on Production and Services or IEPS for its acronym in Spanish paid when purchasing diesel used for general machinery and certain mining vehicles.
The credit can be applied against either the Groups own corporate income tax or the income tax withheld from third parties.
The credit is calculated on an entitybyentity basis and expires one year after the purchase of the diesel.
In the year ended 31 December 2017 the Group applied a credit of US23.2 million 2016 US19.1 million in respect of the year and recognised a deferred tax asset of US2.9 million 2016 US4.8 million in respect of the IEPS incurred in 2017 and expected to be applied during 2018.
As the IEPS deduction is itself taxable the deferred tax asset is recognised at 70% of the IEPS carried forward.
The net amount applied by the Group is presented in the reconciliation of the effective tax rate in note 10b.
The SMR states that the owners of mining titles and concessions are subject to pay an annual mining right of 7.5% of the profit derived from the extractive activities and is considered as income tax under IFRS.
The SMR allows as a credit the payment of mining concessions rights up to the amount of SMR payable The 7.5% tax apply to a base of income before interest annual inflation adjustment taxes paid on the regular activity depreciation and amortisation as defined by the new ISR.
This SMR can be credited against the corporate income tax of the same fiscal year and its payment must be remitted no later than the last business day of March of the following year .

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS As at 31 December 2017 and 2016 the carrying amount of mining assets was fully supported by the higher of value in use and fair value less cost of disposal FVLCD computation of their recoverable amount.
Value in use and FVLCD was determined based on the net present value of the future estimated cash flows expected to be generated from the continued use of the CGUs.
For both valuation approaches management used price assumptions of US1300ounce and US19ounce 2016 US1250ounce and US18ounce for gold and silver respectively.
Management considers that the models supporting the carrying amounts are most sensitive to commodity price assumptions and have therefore performed a sensitivity analysis for those CGUs where a reasonable possible change in prices could lead to impairment.
Management has considered a low sensitivity by decreasing gold and silver prices by 5% 2016 gold and silver 10% and a high sensitivity by decreasing gold and silver prices by 10% 2016 gold 15% and silver 20%.
As at 31 December 2017 no impairment resulted in those CGU tested 2016 San Julin US84.3 million under high sensitivity USnil under low sensitivity and Herradura US109.6 million under high sensitivity USnil under low sensitivity.

At 31 December 2017 several investments in quoted shares were valued below the cost paid by the Group.
This decrease has continued throughout the past 12month period which is considered to be prolonged therefore an impairment of US0.04 million was recognised as other expenses in the income statement.
During 2016 no impairment arose on the investment in quoted shares.
The fair value of the availableforsale financial assets is determined by reference to published price quotations in an active market.

SILVERSTREAM CONTRACT On 31 December 2007 the Group entered into an agreement with Peoles through which it is entitled to receive the proceeds received by the Peoles Group in respect of the refined silver sold from the Sabinas Mine Sabinas a base metals mine owned and operated by the Peoles Group for an upfront payment of US350 million.
In addition a per ounce cash payment of US2.00 in years one to five and US5.00 thereafter subject to an inflationary adjustment that commenced from 31 December 2013 is payable to Peoles.
The cash payment per ounce for the year ended 31 December 2017 was US5.20 per ounce 2016 US5.15 per ounce.
Under the contract the Group has the option to receive a net cash settlement from Peoles attributable to the silver produced and sold from Sabinas to take delivery of an equivalent amount of refined silver or to receive settlement in the form of both cash and silver .
If by 31 December 2032 the amount of silver produced by Sabinas is less than 60 million ounces a further payment is due from Peoles of US1 per ounce of shortfall.
The Silverstream contract represents a derivative financial instrument which has been recorded at fair value and classified within noncurrent and current assets as appropriate.

The Group has the following restrictions derived from the issuance of the Senior Notes the Notes CHANGE OF CONTROL Should the rating of the Senior Notes be downgraded as a result of a change of control defined as the sale or transfer of 35% or more of the common shares the transfer of all or substantially all the assets of the Group starting a dissolution or liquidation process or the loss of the majority in the Board of Directors the Group is obligated to repurchase the Notes at an equivalent price of 101% of their nominal value plus the interest earnt at the repurchase date if requested to do so by any creditor .
PLEDGE ON ASSETS The Group shall not pledge or allow a pledge on any property that may have a material impact on business performance key assets.
Nevertheless the Group may pledge the aforementioned properties provided that the repayment of the Notes keeps the same level of priority as the pledge on those assets.
PROVISION FOR MINE CLOSURE COST The provision represents the discounted values of the estimated cost to decommission and rehabilitate the mines at the estimated date of depletion of mine deposits.
Uncertainties in estimating these costs include potential changes in regulatory requirements decommissioning dismantling reclamation alternatives timing and the discount foreign exchange and inflation rates applied.
During the year the Group refined its estimation of costs by further analysing the currency in which costs will be incurred.
The
Group has performed separate calculations of the provision by currency discounting at corresponding rates.
As at 31 December 2017 the discount rates used in the calculation of the parts of the provision that relate to Mexican pesos range from 6.27% to 7.97% 2016 range of 6.61% to 7.74%.
The range for the current year parts that relate to US dollars range from 1.37% to 2.22% 2016 not applicable.
Mexican regulations regarding the decommissioning and rehabilitation of mines are limited and less developed in comparison to regulations in many other jurisdictions.
It is the Groups intention to rehabilitate the mines beyond the requirements of Mexican law and estimated costs reflect this level of expense.
The Group intends to fully rehabilitate the affected areas at the end of the life of the mines.
FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
PROVISION FOR MINE CLOSURE COST CONTINUED The provision is expected to become payable at the end of the production life of each mine based on the reserves and resources which ranges from three to 27 years from 31 December 2017 three to 27 years from 31 December 2016.

The defined contribution plan was established as from 1 July 2007 and consists of periodic contributions made by each non unionised worker and contributions made by the Group to the fund matching workers contributions capped at 8% of the employees annual salary.
The defined benefit plan provides pension benefits based on each workers earnings and years of services provided by personnel hired through 30 June 2007 as well as statutory seniority premiums for both unionised and nonunionised workers.
The overall investment policy and strategy for the Groups defined benefit plan is guided by the objective of achieving an investment return which together with contributions ensures that there will be sufficient assets to pay pension benefits and statutory seniority premiums for nonunionised workers as they fall due while also mitigating the various risks of the plan.
However the portion of the plan related to statutory seniority premiums for unionised workers is not funded.
The investment strategies for the plan are generally managed under local laws and regulations.
The actual asset allocation is determined by current and expected economic and market conditions and in consideration of specific asset class risk in the risk profile.
Within this framework the Group ensures that the trustees consider how the asset investment strategy correlates with the maturity profile of the plan liabilities and the respective potential impact on the funded status of the plan including potential shortterm liquidity requirements.
Death and disability benefits are covered through insurance policies.

These leases have renewal terms at the option of the lessee with future lease payments based on market prices at the time of renewal.
There are no restrictions placed upon the Group by entering into these leases.
The Group has put in place several arrangements to finance mine equipment through loans and the sale of mine equipment to contractors.
In both cases contractors are obligated to use these assets in rendering services to the Group as part of the mining work contract during the term of financing or credit which ranges from two to six years.
The Group considers that the related mining work contracts contain embedded operating leases.

As of 31 December 2017 the Group has the following contingencies The Group is subject to various laws and regulations which if not observed could give rise to penalties.
Tax periods remain open to review by the Mexican tax authorities SAT by its Spanish acronym in respect of income taxes for five years following the date of the filing of corporate income tax returns during which time the authorities have the right to raise additional tax assessments including penalties and interest.
Under certain circumstances the reviews may cover longer periods.
As such there is a risk that transactions and in particular related party transactions that have not been challenged in the past by the authorities may be challenged by them in the future.
There are currently a number of ongoing tax inspections that have been initiated by the SAT.
No findings or claims have been communicated to the Company in respect of these other than relating to Penmont as discussed below.
It is not practical to determine the amount of any potential claims or the likelihood of any unfavourable outcome arising from these or any future inspections that may be initiated.
However management believes that its interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate and that the Group has complied with all regulations and paid or accrued all taxes and withholdings that are applicable.
FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONTINGENCIES CONTINUED With regards to Penmont tax audits which commenced during 2015 the Company considers it completed the provision of all documentation required in order to demonstrate that all the 20122013 nontaxable income and tax deductions which are being challenged are appropriate.
Penmont formally filed a writ before the Mexican Taxpayers Ombudsman PRODECON per its Spanish acronym requesting a conclusive agreement in the matter .
SATs first second and third response to the request detailed that while the documentation provided was sufficient to demonstrate that all of nontaxable income and the majority of the tax deductions are correct there are still two tax deductions to be approved.
In this sense discussion with the SAT continue and as long as the conclusive agreement is still in progress the current auditing process is suspended and the tax authorities cannot determine a tax deficiency until PRODECON issues the final agreement under the terms agreed between Penmont and the SAT.
On 8 May 2008 the Company and Peoles entered into the Separation Agreement the Separation Agreement.
This agreement relates to the separation of the Group and the Peoles Group and governs certain aspects of the relationship between the Fresnillo Group and the Peoles Group following the initial public offering in May 2008 Admission.
The Separation Agreement provides for crossindemnities between the Company and Peoles so that in the case of Peoles it is held harmless against losses claims and liabilities including tax liabilities properly attributable to the precious metals business of the Group and in the case of the Company it is held harmless by Peoles against losses claims and liabilities which are not properly attributable to the precious metals business.
Save for any liability arising in connection with tax the aggregate liability of either party under the indemnities shall not exceed US250 million in aggregate.
Peoles has agreed to indemnify the Fresnillo Group in relation to i any tax charge subject to certain exceptions the Company may incur as a result of the PreIPO Reorganisation including as a result of a transaction following Admission of a member of the Fresnillo Group provided that Peoles has confirmed that the proposed transaction will not give rise to a tax charge or as a result of a transaction of a member of the Peoles Group on or after Admission the Global Offer or Admission and ii certain tax aspects of certain other preAdmission transactions.
Peoles liability under these indemnities and in respect of general tax liabilities arising preAdmission which are not properly attributable to the precious metals business of the Fresnillo Group shall not exceed US500 million.
If a member of the Fresnillo Group forming part of Peoles tax consolidation pays an intraGroup dividend in excess of its net income tax account Cuenta de Utilidad Fiscal Neta or CUFIN account after Admission and is relieved of tax as a result of the consolidation it is required to pay Peoles an amount in respect of that tax.
On 30 November 2012 the Mexican government enacted a new federal labour law.
During 2014 management implemented certain actions as a part of an ongoing process in order to manage the exposure resulting from the issuance of the new labour law including any potential impacts on the operations and financial position of the Group however management does not expect any potential contingency or significant effect on the Groups financial statements as at 31 December 2017 and going forward.
New income tax and VAT legislation in respect of contractors came into effect on 1 January 2017 requiring management to ensure that contractors are compliant with their own tax obligations including employment tax.
This has created a new obligation for Fresnillo to obtain and retain sufficient evidence of contractors fiscal compliance in order to deduct costs related to the contractors for income tax purposes and to recover input VAT.
In late 2017 the 2018 Federal Revenue Law clarified that if the online portal established by the tax authorities to facilitate compliance is used in 2018 it would be sufficient to discharge any 2017 compliance obligations.
Management considers that it is well progressed in meeting its obligations for 2017 and does not consider that any significant economic exposure will arise as a result of this new legislation with respect to the current year .
In regard to the ejido El Bajo matter previously reported by the Company In 2009 five members of the El Bajo agrarian community in the state of Sonora who claimed rights over certain surface land in the proximity of the operations of Minera Penmont Penmont submitted a legal claim before the Unitarian Agrarian Court Tribunal Unitario Agrario of Hermosillo Sonora to have Penmont vacate an area of this surface land.
The land in dispute encompassed a portion of surface area where part of the operations of the SoledadDipolos mine are located.
The litigation resulted in a definitive court order pursuant to which Penmont was ordered to vacate 1824 hectares of land.
The disputed land was returned in July 2013 resulting in the suspension of operations at SoledadDipolos.
The Agrarian Court noted in that same year that certain remediation activities were necessary to comply with the relevant regulatory requirements and requested the guidance of the Federal Environmental Agency SEMARNAT in this respect.
The Agrarian Court further issued a procedural order in execution of his ruling determining amongst other aspects that Penmont must remediate the lands to the state they were in before Penmonts occupation.
In the opinion of the Company this procedural order was excessive since this level of remediation was not part of the original agrarian ruling and also because the procedural order appeared not to consider the fact that Penmont conducted its activities pursuant to valid mining concessions and environmental impact permits.
In December 2016 the Agrarian Court issued a subsequent procedural order in which the Court recognised that Penmont complied with the agrarian ruling by having returned the land in dispute and furthermore that remediation activities are to be conducted in accordance with Federal environmental guidelines and regulations as supervised by the competent Federal authorities.
Remediation activities in this respect are pending as the agrarian members have not yet permitted Penmont physical access to the lands.
Penmont has already presented a conceptual mine closure and remediation plan before the Agrarian Court in respect of the approximately 300 hectares where Penmont conducted mining activities.
The agrarian community Ejido El Bajo appealed this procedural order from the Agrarian Court and a Federal District Court denied this appeal.
The agrarian community has presented in the month of August 2017 a further and last recourse against this ruling by the Federal District Court and the final result is pending.

STATEMENTS
In addition and as also previously reported by the Company claimants in the El Bajo matter presented other claims against occupation agreements they entered into with Penmont covering land parcels separate from the land described above.
Penmont has no significant mining operations or specific geological interest in the affected parcels and these lands are therefore not considered strategic for Penmont.
As previously reported the Agrarian Court issued rulings declaring such occupation agreements over those land parcels to be null and void and that Penmont must remediate such lands to the state that they were in before Penmonts occupation as well as returning any minerals extracted from this area.
Given that Penmont has not conducted significant mining operations or has specific geological interest in these land parcels any contingency relating to such land parcels is not considered material by the Company.
The case relating to the claims over these land parcels remains subject to finalisation.
Various claims and counterclaims have been made between the relevant parties in the El Bajo matter .
There remains significant uncertainty as to the finalisation and ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings.

The following valuation techniques were used to estimate the fair values OPTION AND FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties principally financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings.
The foreign currency forward Level 2 contracts are measured based on observable spot exchange rates the yield curves of the respective currencies as well as the currency basis spreads between the respective currencies.
The foreign currency option contracts are valued using the Black Scholes model the significant inputs to which include observable spot exchange rates interest rates and the volatility of the currency.
OPTION COMMODITY CONTRACTS The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties principally financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings.
The option commodity Level 2 contracts are measured based on observable spot commodity prices the yield curves of the respective commodity as well as the commodity basis spreads between the respective commodities.
The option contracts are valued using the Black Scholes model the significant inputs to which include observable spot commodities price interest rates and the volatility of the commodity.
SILVERSTREAM CONTRACT The fair value of the Silverstream contract is determined using a valuation model including unobservable inputs Level 3.
This derivative has a term of over 20 years and the valuation model utilises a number of inputs that are not based on observable market data due to the nature of these inputs andor the duration of the contract.
Inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are the volume of silver that will be produced and sold from the Sabinas mine over the contract life the future price of silver future foreign exchange rates between the Mexican peso and US dollar future inflation and the discount rate used to discount future cash flows.
The estimate of the volume of silver that will be produced and sold from the Sabinas mine requires estimates of the recoverable silver reserves and resources the related production profile based on the Sabinas mine plan and the expected recovery of silver from ore mined.
The estimation of these inputs is subject to a range of operating assumptions and may change over time.
Estimates of reserves and resources are updated annually by Peoles the operator and sole interest holder in the Sabinas mine and provided to the Company.
The production profile and estimated payable silver that will be recovered from ore mined is based on the latest plan and estimates also provided to the Company by Peoles.
The inputs assume no interruption in production over the life of the Silverstream contract and production levels which are consistent with those achieved in recent years Management regularly assesses a range of reasonably possible alternatives for those significant unobservable inputs described above and determines their impact on the total fair value.
The significant unobservable inputs are not interrelated.
The fair value of the Silverstream is not significantly sensitive to a reasonable change in future exchange rates however it is to a reasonable change in future silver price future inflation and the discount rate used to discount future cash flows.
For further information relating to the Silverstream contract see note 14.
The sensitivity of the valuation to the inputs relating to market risks being the price of silver foreign exchange rates inflation and the discount rate is disclosed in note 31.
FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED B FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT CONTINUED QUOTED INVESTMENTS The fair value of availableforsale financial assets is derived from quoted market prices in active markets.
Level 1 INTERESTBEARING LOANS The fair value of the Groups interestbearing loan is derived from quoted market prices in active markets.
Level 1 EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES WITHIN SALES CONTRACTS Sales of concentrates precipitates and dor bars are provisionally priced and revenue is initially recognised using this provisional price and the Groups best estimate of the contained metal.
Revenue is subject to final price and metal content adjustments subsequent to the date of delivery see note 2p.
This price exposure is considered to be an embedded derivative and is separated from the sales contract.
At each reporting date the provisionally priced metal content is revalued based on the forward selling price for the quotational period stipulated in the relevant sales contract.
The selling price of metals can be reliably measured as these metals are actively traded on international exchanges but the estimated metal content is a nonobservable input to this valuation Level 3.
At 31 December 2017 the fair value of embedded derivatives within sales contracts was US6.5 million 2016 US2.7 million.
The revaluation effects of embedded derivatives arising from these sales contracts are recorded as an adjustment to revenues.
C DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Group enters into certain forward and option contracts in order to manage its exposure to foreign exchange risk associated with costs incurred in Mexican pesos and other currencies.
The Group also enters into option contracts to manage its exposure to commodity price risk as described in note 2s.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
OVERVIEW
The Groups principal financial assets and liabilities other than derivatives comprise trade receivables cash availablefor sale financial assets interestbearing loans and trade payables.
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments Market risk including foreign currency commodity price interest rate inflation rate and equity price risks Credit risk and Liquidity risk.
This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks and the Groups objectives policies and processes for assessing and managing risk.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout the financial statements.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The Groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Group through its training and management standards and procedures aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The Fresnillo Audit Committee has responsibility for overseeing how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
The Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit which undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
OVERVIEW CONTINUED A MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk that changes in market factors such as foreign exchange rates commodity prices or interest rates will affect the Groups income or the value of its financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters while optimising the return on risk.
In the following tables the effect on equity excludes the changes in retained earnings as a direct result of changes in profit before tax.
FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK The Group has financial instruments that are denominated in Mexican peso euro and Swedish krona which are exposed to foreign currency risk.
Transactions in currencies other than the US dollar include the purchase of services fixed assets spare parts and the payment of dividends.
As a result the Group has financial assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currency and holds cash and cash equivalents in Mexican peso.
In order to manage the Groups exposure to foreign currency risk on expenditure denominated in currencies other than the US dollar the Group has entered into certain forward and option derivative contracts with maturity dates from 2018 see note 30 for additional detail.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial assets and financial liabilities excluding Silverstream to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar exchange rate compared to the Mexican peso reflecting the impact on the Groups profit before tax and equity with all other variables held constant.
It is assumed that the same percentage change in exchange rates is applied to all applicable periods for the purposes of calculating the sensitivity with relation to derivative financial instruments.

The financial assets are trade and other receivables cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments the Silverstream contract and availableforsale financial assets.
The Groups policies are aimed at minimising losses as a result of counterparties failure to honour their obligations.
Individual
The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counterparty.
The Groups financial assets are with counterparties with what the Group considers to have an appropriate credit rating.
As disclosed in note 27 the counterparties to a significant proportion of these financial assets are related parties.
At each balance sheet date the Groups financial assets were neither impaired nor past due other than Other receivables as disclosed in note 16.
The Groups policies are aimed at minimising losses from foreign currency hedging contracts.
The Companys foreign currency hedging contracts are entered into with large financial institutions with strong credit ratings.
The Group has a high concentration of trade receivables with one counterparty MetMex Peoles the Groups primary customer throughout 2017 and 2016.
A further concentration of credit risk arises from the Silverstream contract.
Both MetMex and the counterparty to the Silverstream contract are subsidiaries in the Peoles group which currently owns 75% of the shares of the Company and is considered by management to be of appropriate credit rating.
FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
OVERVIEW CONTINUED B CREDIT RISK CONTINUED The Groups surplus funds are managed by Servicios Administrativos Fresnillo S. de C. equivalents including shortterm investments investing in a number of financial institutions.
Accordingly on an ongoing basis the Group deposits surplus funds with a range of financial institutions depending on market conditions.
In order to minimise exposure to credit risk the Group only deposits surplus funds with financial institutions with a credit rating of MX1 Moodys and mxA1 Standard and Poors and above.
As at 31 December 2017 the Group had concentrations of credit risk as 23% of surplus funds were deposited with one financial institution of which 17% was held in shortterm Mexican government paper .
The maximum credit exposure at the reporting date of each category of financial asset above is the carrying value as detailed in the relevant notes.
See note 13 for the maximum credit exposure to availableforsale financial assets note 17 for shortterm investments and cash and cash equivalents and note 27 for related party balances with MetMex.
The maximum credit exposure with relation to the Silverstream contract is the value of the derivative as at 31 December 2017 being US538.9 million 2016 US467.5 million.
C LIQUIDITY RISK Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group monitors its risk of a shortage of funds using projected cash flows from operations and by monitoring the maturity of both its financial assets and liabilities.

The financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2017 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors of Fresnillo plc on 26 February 2018.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES A BASIS OF PREPARATION AND STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union as they apply to the financial statements of the Company for the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2016 and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for certain derivative financial instruments and availableforsale financial instruments which have been measured at fair value.
The financial statements are presented in dollars of the United States of America US dollars or US and all monetary amounts are rounded to the nearest thousand US000 except when otherwise indicated.
The basis of preparation and accounting policies used in preparing the financial statements are set out below.
These accounting policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented unless otherwise stated.
B CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES The accounting policies applied are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the separate financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016.
NEW STANDARDS INTERPRETATIONS AND AMENDMENTS NEW STANDARDS ADOPTED BY THE COMPANY The Company has adopted from 1 January 2017 Amendments to IAS 7.
The amendments require an entity to provide disclosures that enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities.
The Company also has adopted Amendments to IAS 12.
The amendments clarify the accounting for deferred tax where an asset is measured at fair value and that fair value is below the assets tax base.
They also clarify certain other aspects of accounting for deferred tax assets.
This amendment had no impact in the financial information of the Company.
Other than the above mentioned amendment there were no significant new standards that the Company was required to adopt effective from 1 January 2017.
STANDARDS INTERPRETATIONS AND AMENDMENTS ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE The standards and interpretations that are issued but not yet effective up to the date of issuance of the Companys financial statements are disclosed below.
The Company intends to adopt these standards as applicable to the Companys financial statements when they become effective except where indicated.
IFRS 9 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IFRS 9 Financial Instruments addresses the classification measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities introduces new rules for hedge accounting and a new impairment model for financial assets.
The Company has decided not to adopt IFRS 9 until it becomes mandatory on 1 January 2018.
The Company does not expect the new guidance to have a significant impact on the classification and measurement of its financial assets for the following reasons CLASSIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT The equity instruments that are currently classified as availableforsale financial assets satisfy the conditions for classification as at fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI.
Under IFRS 9 gains and losses accumulated in OCI are not recycled to the income statement.
There are no other significant changes to the accounting for these assets.
There will be no impact on the Companys accounting for financial liabilities as the new requirements only affect the accounting for financial liabilities that are designated at fair value through profit or loss and the Group does not have any such liabilities.
DERECOGNITION
The derecognition rules have been transferred from IAS 39 Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement and have not been changed.

IMPAIRMENT
IFRS 9 requires the Company to now use an expected credit loss model for its trade receivables measured at amortised cost either on a 12month or lifetime basis.
Given the shortterm nature of these receivables the Company does not expect these changes will have a significant impact.
Regarding loans receivables the Company has evaluated the expect credit loss on a 12month basis.
No material loss has been determined.
PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE The new standard also introduces expanded disclosure requirements and changes in presentation.
These are expected to change the nature and extent of the Companys disclosures about its financial instruments particularly in the year of the adoption of the new standard.
IFRS 15 REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS The IASB has issued a new standard for the recognition of revenue arising from contracts with customers.
The new revenue standard will supersede all current revenue recognition requirements under IFRS.
The new standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognised when control of a good or service transfers to a customer .
In the case of royalties the revenue is recognised based on the salesor usagebased royalties criteria.
The Company has evaluated recognition and measurement of revenue based on the fivestep model in IFRS 15 and has not identified any financial impacts hence no adjustments are expected to result from the adoption of IFRS 15.
The Company has elected to adopt the new standard from 1 January 2018 applying the modified retrospective adoption method.
IFRS 16 LEASES IFRS 16 introduces a single lessee accounting model and requires a lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 months unless the underlying asset is of low value.
A lessee is required to recognise a rightofuse asset representing its right to use the underlying leased asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments.
IFRS 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in IAS 17.
Accordingly a lessor continues to classify its leases as operating leases or finance leases and to account for those two types of leases differently.
These amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and earlier application is permitted.
However as there are several interactions between IFRS 16 and IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers early application is restricted to entities that also early adopt IFRS 15.
The Company has decided to adopt the standard when it became effective.
IFRIC 22 FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS AND ADVANCE CONSIDERATION IFRIC 22 clarifies which exchange rate to use in reporting foreign currency transactions when payment is made or received in advance.
The interpretation requires the Company to determine a date of transaction for the purposes of selecting an exchange rate to use on initial recognition of the related asset expense or income.
In case there are multiple payments or receipts in advance the entity should determine a date of the transaction for each flow of advance consideration.
IFRIC 22 is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and earlier adoption is permitted.
The interpretation is not expected to have any impact in the financial information of the Company.
IFRIC 23 UNCERTAINTY OVER INCOME TAX TREATMENTS This Interpretation clarifies how to apply the recognition and measurement requirements in IAS 12 when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments.
The interpretation is to be applied to the determination of taxable profit tax loss tax bases unused tax losses unused tax credits and tax rates when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments.
Application of tax law can be complex and requires judgement to assess risk and estimate outcomes where the amount of tax payable or recoverable is uncertain.
The Company is working to identify potential uncertainties based on previous resolutions of tax authorities.
IFRIC 23 is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and earlier adoption is permitted.
The IASB has issued other amendments to standards including those resulting from improvements to IFRSs that management considers do not have any impact on the accounting policies financial position or performance of the Company.
The Company has not early adopted any standard interpretation or amendment that was issued but is not yet effective.
C SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS The preparation of the Companys financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements.
These judgements and estimates are based on managements knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances with regard to prior experience but actual results may differ from the amounts included in the financial statements.
Information about such judgements and estimates is in the accounting policies and the notes to the financial statements.
FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED C SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS CONTINUED
Areas of judgement apart from those involving estimations that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are Determination of functional currency note 2d The determination of functional currency requires management judgement particularly where there may be more than one currency in which transactions are undertaken and which impact the economic environment in which the entity operates.
Contingencies note 13 By their nature contingencies will be resolved only when one or more uncertain future events occur or fail to occur .
The assessment of the existence and potential quantum of contingencies inherently involves the exercise of significant judgement and the use of estimates regarding the outcome of future events.
ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS Significant areas of estimation uncertainty made by management in preparing the financial information statements include Impairment of availableforsale financial assets notes 2g and 6 The Company classifies certain financial asset as availableforsale and recognises movements in their fair value in equity.
When the fair value declines management makes an assessment of the decline in value to determine whether it is an impairment that should be recognised in profit or loss.
Impairment and subsequent reversal of impairment of investments in subsidiaries notes 2e and 5 The Company assesses investments in subsidiaries annually to determine whether any indication of impairment exists.
Where an indicator of impairment exists a formal estimate of the recoverable amount is made which is considered to be the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal FVLCD and the value in use.
Due to the nature of the subsidiaries the assessment of the recoverable amount is generally determined based on the net present value of future cash flows related to the subsidiaries requiring the use of estimates and assumptions such as longterm commodity prices reserves and resources and the associate production profiles discount rates future capital requirements exploration potential and operating performance.
These cash flows are discounted using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
The determination of that rate requires certain judgements.
Where an impairment charge has previously been recognised the Company assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If any such indication exists the Company estimates the recoverable amount of that investment requiring similar estimates and assumptions as those for determining an impairment charge.
At 31 December 2017 the Company reversed impairment losses of US102.8 million 2016 US997.9 million to recognised a cumulative impairment relating to subsidiaries of US436.4 million 2016 US539.2 million.
D FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION The Companys financial statements are presented in US dollars which is the functional currency of the Company.
The functional currency for the Company is determined by the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All differences that arise are recorded in the income statement.
Nonmonetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions.
Nonmonetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into US dollars using the exchange rate at the date when the fair valued is determined.
E INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES Subsidiaries are entities which the Company controls due to it being exposed to or has the right to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
Investments in subsidiaries are recognised at acquisition cost less any provision for impairment.
Impairment charges and reversals up to the value of the merger reserve are reclassified from retained earnings to the merger reserve.
When the Company increases its capital investment in or where there is a return of share capital from its subsidiaries such movements are recognised as an addition to or return of the original cost recognised in investment in subsidiaries.

REPORT
CORPORATE

FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
At each reporting date an assessment is made to determine whether there are any indicators of impairment.
Where an indicator of impairment exists an estimate of the recoverable amount of the investment in subsidiary is made which is considered to be the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use.
The Company usually determines fair value based on the net present value of the future cash flows related to its subsidiaries.
If the carrying amount of an investment exceeds the recoverable amount a provision is recorded in the income statement to reflect the investment at the recoverable amount.
Where an impairment charge has previously been recognised an assessment is made at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If any such indication exists an estimate of the recoverable amount is made.
An impairment loss is reversed to profit or loss to the extent that the increased carrying value of the investment in subsidiary does not exceed that that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
F FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Financial assets are recognised when the Company becomes party to contracts that give rise to them and are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss loans and receivables held to maturity investments or availableforsale financial assets as appropriate.
The Company determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and reevaluates this designation at each balance sheet date.
When financial assets are recognised initially they are measured at fair value plus in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss directly attributable transaction costs.
The Company recognises financial liabilities on its balance sheet when and only when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial liabilities are classified at fair value through profit or loss loans and borrowings payables or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge as appropriate.
All financial liabilities are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received including any transaction costs incurred.
Financial assets are offset with liabilities and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS Financial assets and liabilities classified as heldfortrading and other assets or liabilities designated as fair value transactions through profit and loss at inception are included in this category.
Financial assets or liabilities are classified as heldfortrading if they are acquired or incurred for the purpose of selling in the short term.
Derivatives are also classified as heldfortrading unless they are designated as hedging instruments as defined by IAS 39.
Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognised in the income statement.
LOANS AND RECEIVABLES Loans and receivables are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or available forsale.
After initial measurement such assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any allowance for impairment.
Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired as well as through the amortisation process.
Current trade receivables are carried at the original invoice amount less provision made for impairment of these receivables.
Noncurrent receivables are stated at amortised cost.
LOANS AND BORROWINGS After initial recognition interestbearing loans are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate EIR method.
The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the income statement.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process.
The Company adjusts the carrying amount of the financial liability to reflect actual and revised estimated cash flows.
The carrying amount is recalculated by computing the present value of estimated future cash flows at the financial instruments original effective interest rate or when applicable the revised effective interest rate.
Any adjustment is recognised in profit or loss as income or expense.
This category generally applies to interestbearing loans.
For more information refer note 11.
FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED F FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CONTINUED AVAILABLEFORSALE FINANCIAL ASSETS Availableforsale financial assets are those nonderivative financial assets that are designated as such or are not classified in any of the preceding categories and are not heldtomaturity investments.
Availableforsale financial assets represent equity investments that have a quoted market price in an active market therefore a fair value can be reliably measured.
After initial measurement availableforsale financial assets are measured at fair value with marktomarket unrealised gains or losses being recognised as other comprehensive income in the availableforsale reserve until the financial asset is derecognised.
Financial assets classified as availableforsale are derecognised when they are sold and all the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.
When financial assets are sold the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised in equity are included in the income statement within other operating income or expense.
DERECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES A financial asset or liability is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled sold cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss.
The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability or part of a financial liability extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid including any noncash assets transferred or liabilities assumed is recognised in the income statement.
G IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
ASSETS CARRIED AT AMORTISED COST If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortised cost has been incurred the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows excluding future expected credit losses that have not been incurred discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate i. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account.
The amount of the loss is recognised in profit or loss.
The Company first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant and individually or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant.
If it is determined that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset whether significant or not the asset is included in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and that group of financial assets is collectively assessed for impairment.
Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognised are not included in a collective assessment of impairment.
If in a subsequent period the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed.
Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date.
In relation to trade receivables a provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor that the Company will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of the invoice.
The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account.
Impaired receivables are derecognised when they are assessed as uncollectible.
AVAILABLEFORSALE FINANCIAL ASSETS If an availableforsale financial asset is impaired an amount comprising the difference between its cost net of any principal payment and amortisation and its current fair value less any impairment loss previously recognised in the income statement is transferred from equity to the income statement.
In assessing whether there is an impairment the Company considers whether a decline in fair value is either significant or prolonged by considering the size of the decline in this value the historic volatility in changes in fair value and the duration of the sustained decline.
Reversals in respect of equity instruments classified as availableforsale are not recognised in the income statement.

H CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS For the purposes of the balance sheet cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank cash on hand and shortterm deposits held with banks that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
Shortterm deposits earn interest at the respective shortterm deposit rates between one day and four months.
For the purposes of the cash flow statement cash and cash equivalents as defined above are shown net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
I SHARE CAPITAL Ordinary shares issued by the Company are recorded at the net proceeds received which is the fair value of the consideration received less costs that are incurred in connection with the share issue.
The nominal par value of the shares issued is taken to the share capital account and any excess is recorded in the share premium account including the costs that were incurred with the share issue.
J REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Company and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received excluding discounts rebates and other sales taxes.
TRADEMARK ROYALTIES Trademark royalty income is recognised only at the time when it is probable that the amounts related to certain rights will be received INTEREST INCOME Interest income is recognised as interest accrues using the effective interest method i. financial asset.
DIVIDEND INCOME Dividend income is recognised when the Companys right to receive the payment is established.
K INCOME TAX CURRENT INCOME TAX Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
DEFERRED INCOME TAX Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except Where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and at the time of transaction affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit loss and In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries associates and interests in joint ventures where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except Where the deferred income tax asset relating to deductible temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss and In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries associates and interests in joint ventures deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED K INCOME TAX CONTINUED Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
L DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING The Company enters into derivative contracts in order to manage certain market risks derived from changes in foreign exchange and commodity prices which impact the financial and business transactions of its subsidiaries.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
In the Groups consolidated financial statements certain of these derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges but for the purposes of the Companys standalone financial statements the related hedged items are not held by the Company so do not qualify as cash flow hedges.
Any gains and losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to the income statement.
Derivatives are valued using valuation approaches and methodologies such as Black Scholes and Net Present Value applicable to the specific type of derivative instrument.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES Contracts are assessed for the existence of embedded derivatives at the date that the Company first becomes party to the contract with reassessment only if there is a change to the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows.
Embedded derivatives which are not clearly and closely related to the underlying asset liability or transaction are separated and accounted for as standalone derivatives.
M FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT The Company measures financial instruments at fair value at each balance sheet date.
Fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed in notes 17 and 18.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either In the principal market for the asset or liability or In the absence of a principal market in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the Company.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.
A fair value measurement of a nonfinancial asset takes into account a market participants ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.
The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy described as follows based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole Level 1  Quoted unadjusted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
Level 3 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis the Company determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by reassessing categorisation based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole at the end of each reporting period.
For the purpose of fair value disclosures the Company has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.
Further information on fair values is described in note 17.
N DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTION Dividends payable to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Mexican Income Tax Law establishes a 10% withholding on earnings from 2014 and thereafter for dividends paid to foreign residents and Mexican individuals.
Dividends paid are not subject to income tax if paid from the Net Tax Profit Account CUFIN.
Dividends paid that exceed CUFIN are subject to an income tax payable at a rate of 30%.
The tax is payable by the Company and may be credited against the normal income tax payable by the Company in the year in which the dividends are paid or in the following two years.
Dividends paid from earnings previously taxed are not subject to any withholding or additional tax payment.
SEGMENT REPORTING Segmental information is not presented in the Companys standalone financial statements as this is presented in the Groups consolidated financial statements.

CONTINGENCIES
As of 31 December 2017 the Company has the following contingencies The Company is subject to various laws and regulations which if not observed could give rise to penalties.
Tax periods remain open to review by the Mexican tax authorities in respect of income taxes for five years following the date of the filing of the corporate income tax return during which time the authorities have the right to raise additional tax assessments including penalties and interest.
Under certain circumstances the reviews may cover longer periods.
As such there is a risk that transactions and in particular related party transactions that have not been challenged in the past by the authorities may be challenged by them in the future.
There are currently a number of ongoing tax inspections that have been initiated by the SAT in respect of certain subsidiaries of the Company.
No findings or claims have been communicated to the Company in respect of these other than relating to Penmont as discussed below.
It is not practical to determine the amount of any potential claims or the likelihood of any unfavourable outcome arising from these or any future inspections that may be initiated.
However management believes that its interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate and that the Group has complied with all regulations and paid or accrued all taxes and withholdings that are applicable.
With regards to Penmont tax audits which commenced during 2015 the Company considers it completed the provision of all documentation required in order to demonstrate that all the 20122013 nontaxable income and tax deductions which are being challenged are appropriate.
Penmont formally filed a writ before the Mexican Taxpayers Ombudsman PRODECON per its Spanish acronym requesting a conclusive agreement in the matter .
SATs first second and third response to the request detailed that while the documentation provided was sufficient to demonstrate that all of nontaxable income and the majority of the tax deductions are correct there are still two tax deductions to be approved.
In this sense discussion with the SAT continue and as long as the conclusive agreement is still in progress the current auditing process is suspended and the tax authorities cannot determine a tax deficiency until PRODECON issues the final agreement under the terms agreed between Penmont and the SAT.
On 8 May 2008 the Company and Peoles entered into the Separation Agreement the Separation Agreement.
This agreement relates to the separation of the Fresnillo Group the Group and the Peoles Group and governs certain aspects of the relationship between the Fresnillo Group and the Peoles Group following the initial public offering in May 2008
The Separation Agreement provides for crossindemnities between the Company and Peoles so that in the case of Peoles it is held harmless against losses claims and liabilities including tax liabilities properly attributable to the precious metals business of the Group and in the case of the Company it is held harmless by Peoles against losses claims and liabilities which are not properly attributable to the precious metals business.
Save for any liability arising in connection with tax the aggregate liability of either party under the indemnities shall not exceed US250 million in aggregate.
Peoles has agreed to indemnify the Fresnillo Group in relation to i any tax charge subject to certain exceptions the Company may incur as a result of the PreIPO Reorganisation including as a result of a transaction following Admission of a member of the Fresnillo Group provided that Peoles has confirmed that the proposed transaction will not give rise to a tax charge or as a result of a transaction of a member of the Peoles Group on or after Admission the Global Offer or Admission and ii certain tax aspects of certain other preAdmission transactions.
Peoles liability under these indemnities and in respect of general tax liabilities arising preAdmission which are not properly attributable to the precious metals business of the Fresnillo Group shall not exceed US500 million.
If a member of the Fresnillo Group forming part of Peoles tax consolidation pays an intraGroup dividend in excess of its net income tax account Cuenta de Utilidad Fiscal Neta or CUFIN account after Admission and is relieved of tax as a result of the consolidation it is required to pay Peoles an amount in respect of that tax.
New income tax and VAT legislation in respect of contractors came into effect on 1 January 2017 requiring management to ensure that contractors are compliant with their own tax obligations including employment tax.
This has created a new obligation for Fresnillo to obtain and retain sufficient evidence of contractors fiscal compliance in order to deduct costs related to the contractors for income tax purposes and to recover input VAT.
In late 2017 the 2018 Federal Revenue Law clarified that if the online portal established by the tax authorities to facilitate compliance is used in 2018 it would be sufficient to discharge any 2017 compliance obligations.
Management considers that it is well progressed in meeting its obligations for 2017 and does not consider that any significant economic exposure will arise as a result of this new legislation with respect to the current year .
In regard to the ejido El Bajo matter previously reported by the Company In 2009 five members of the El Bajo agrarian community in the state of Sonora who claimed rights over certain surface land in the proximity of the operations of Minera Penmont Penmont submitted a legal claim before the Unitarian Agrarian Court Tribunal Unitario Agrario of Hermosillo Sonora to have Penmont vacate an area of this surface land.
The land in dispute encompassed a portion of surface area where part of the operations of the SoledadDipolos mine are located.
The litigation resulted in a definitive court order pursuant to which Penmont was ordered to vacate 1824 hectares of land.
The disputed land was returned in July 2013 resulting in the suspension of operations at SoledadDipolos.
FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONTINGENCIES CONTINUED The Agrarian Court noted in that same year that certain remediation activities were necessary to comply with the relevant regulatory requirements and requested the guidance of the Federal Environmental Agency SEMARNAT in this respect.
The Agrarian Court further issued a procedural order in execution of his ruling determining amongst other aspects that Penmont must remediate the lands to the state they were in before Penmonts occupation.
In the opinion of the Company this procedural order was excessive since this level of remediation was not part of the original agrarian ruling and also because the procedural order appeared not to consider the fact that Penmont conducted its activities pursuant to valid mining concessions and environmental impact permits.
In December 2016 the Agrarian Court issued a subsequent procedural order in which the Court recognised that Penmont complied with the agrarian ruling by having returned the land in dispute and furthermore that remediation activities are to be conducted in accordance with Federal environmental guidelines and regulations as supervised by the competent Federal authorities.
Remediation activities in this respect are pending as the agrarian members have not yet permitted Penmont physical access to the lands.
Penmont has already presented a conceptual mine closure and remediation plan before the Agrarian Court in respect of the approximately 300 hectares where Penmont conducted mining activities.
The agrarian community Ejido El Bajo appealed this procedural order from the Agrarian Court and a Federal District Court denied this appeal.
The agrarian community has presented in the month of August 2017 a further and last recourse against this ruling by the Federal District Court and the final result is pending.
In addition and as also previously reported by the Company claimants in the El Bajo matter presented other claims against occupation agreements they entered into with Penmont covering land parcels separate from the land described above.
Penmont has no significant mining operations or specific geological interest in the affected parcels and these lands are therefore not considered strategic for Penmont.
As previously reported the Agrarian Court issued rulings declaring such occupation agreements over those land parcels to be null and void and that Penmont must remediate such lands to the state that they were in before Penmonts occupation as well as returning any minerals extracted from this area.
Given that Penmont has not conducted significant mining operations or has specific geological interest in these land parcels any contingency relating to such land parcels is not considered material by the Company.
The case relating to the claims over these land parcels remains subject to finalisation.
Various claims and counterclaims have been made between the relevant parties in the El Bajo matter .
There remains significant uncertainty as to the finalisation and ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings.
RELATED PARTY BALANCES AND TRANSACTIONS Related parties are those entities owned or controlled by the ultimate controlling party and include the Companys subsidiaries disclosed in note 5 as well as those entities who have a minority participation in Fresnillo Group companies.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
OVERVIEW
The Companys principal financial assets and liabilities other than derivatives are comprised of trade receivables cash availableforsale financial assets loans to and from related parties interestbearing loans and trade payables.
The Company enters into certain derivative transactions with the purpose of managing foreign exchange risk arising on the activity and transactions of its subsidiaries.
The Company has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments Market risk including foreign currency interest rate and equity price risks Credit risk and Liquidity risk.
This note presents information about the Companys exposure to each of the above risks and the Companys objectives policies and processes for assessing and managing risk.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout the financial statements.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company risk management framework.
The Companys risk management policies have been established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company activities.
The Company through its training and management standards and procedures aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The Fresnillo Audit Committee has responsibility for overseeing how management monitors compliance with the Company risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Company.
The Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit which undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
A MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk that changes in market factors such as foreign exchange rates or interest rates will affect the Company income or the value of its financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters while optimising the return on risk.
FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK The Company is exposed to foreign currency risk on transactions and balances that are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar .
Transactions in foreign currencies include the purchase of services payment or receipt of dividends and other items.
As a result the Company has financial liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currency and holds cash and cash equivalents in Mexican peso.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial assets and financial liabilities to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar exchange rate compared to the Mexican peso reflecting the impact on the Companys profit before tax with all other variables held constant.
It is assumed that the same percentage change in exchange rates is applied to all applicable periods.
There is no impact on the Companys equity other than the equivalent change in retained earnings.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
INTEREST RATE RISK The Company is exposed to interest rate risk from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair values of its financial instruments.
The Companys earnings are sensitive to changes in interest rates on any floating element of the loans with related parties and interest earned on cash balances.
Interestbearing loans are at a fixed rate therefore the possibility of a change in interest rate only impacts its fair value but not its carrying amount.
Therefore interest bearing loans and loans from related parties are excluded from the table below.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of all financial assets and financial liabilities to a reasonably possible change in interest rate applied to a full year from the balance sheet date.
There is no impact on the Companys equity other than the equivalent change in retained earnings.

The financial assets are trade and other receivables intercompany loans cash and cash equivalents and availableforsale financial assets.
The Companys policies are aimed at minimising losses as a result of counterparties failure to honour their obligations.
Individual exposures are monitored with customers subject to credit limits to ensure that the Companys exposure to bad debts is not significant.
The Companys exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counterparty.
The Companys financial assets are with counterparties that the Company considers to have an appropriate credit rating.
As disclosed in note 14 the counterparties to a significant proportion of these financial assets are related parties.
At each balance sheet date the Companys financial assets were neither impaired nor past due.
The Companys policies are aimed at minimising losses from the foreign currency and commodity hedging contracts.
The Companys foreign currency and commodity derivative contracts are entered into with large financial institutions with strong credit ratings.
The Companys surplus funds are managed by Servicios Administrativos Fresnillo S. de C. equivalents investing in a number of financial institutions.
In order to minimise exposure to credit risk the Company only deposits cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions with a credit rating of M1 Moodys and mxA1 Standard and Poors and above and only for periods of less than four months.
The maximum credit exposure at the reporting date of each category of financial asset above is the carrying value as detailed in the relevant notes.
See note 6 for the maximum credit exposure for availableforsale investments note 8 for cash and cash equivalents and note 14 for related party balances.

Management considers that the Company has adequate current assets and forecast cash from operations to manage liquidity risks arising from current liabilities and noncurrent liabilities.
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The primary objective of the Companys capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios that support its business and maximise shareholder value.
Management considers capital to consist of equity and certain interestbearing loans as disclosed in the balance sheet excluding net unrealised gains and losses on revaluation of cash flow hedges and availableforsale financial assets.
In order to ensure an appropriate return for shareholders capital invested in the Company management thoroughly evaluates all material projects and potential acquisitions and approves them at its Executive Committee before submission to the Board for ultimate approval where applicable.
The Companys dividend policy is based on the profitability of the business and underlying growth in earnings of the Group as well as its capital requirements and cash flows.

2 Mineral resources are reported at metal equivalent cutoff grades based on metal price assumptions variable metallurgical recovery assumptions variable metallurgical recoveries as a function of grade and relative metal distribution mining costs processing costs general and administrative GandA costs and variable NSR factors NSR factors include smelting and transportation costs.
The AgEq is calculated by dividing the cost by the Ag net value factor which includes prices recoveries and payabilities.
3 The cutoff grade for Cinegas mineral resources varies between 117 and 162 gpt AgEq.
4 The Mega Centauro SoledadDipolos and Noche Buena resources are reported within pit shells run at a US1250oz Au price.
5 The Mega Centauro SoledadDipolos Noche Buena open pit mines has produced silver at an average concentration of 0.3 gpt to 1.1 gpt.
Silver is not assayed for and is not estimated in the resource model.
Based on past production factored in situ silver in the open pit M and I and I resources is approximately in the range of 14 to 15 moz.
6 Mega Centauro mineral reserves are reported at varied cutoffs dependent on material types and grade.
Oxide material above 0.25 gpt Au reports to the heap leach transitional and sulfide material above 0.30 gpt Au reports to the heap leach oxide material above 0.93 gpt Au reports to the mill transitional and sulfide material above 0.48 gpt Au reports to the mill.
