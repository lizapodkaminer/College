Time Out Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 Stock code TMO
WITH THE CEO What is the most important milestone Time Out Group reached this year 2017 was our first full financial year as a listed company and achieving 59% growth in transaction levels driven by ecommerce and Time Out Market was one of our most important targets.
By achieving substantial progress across our two business divisions we have met the high standards we set for ourselves demonstrating the successful diversification of Time Out on our way to profitability.
Time Out Digital has continued to deliver good progress and revenue growth across ecommerce and Premium Profiles Time Out Market continued to go from strength to strength and within this context we will further expand the format to cities worldwide.
What were the key drivers of 2017 revenue growth Increasingly selling to our global audience is the key driver behind our revenue growth which we saw increasing in the second half of the year demonstrating that we are doing the right things.
Looking at Time Out Digital we are pleased that ecommerce substantially grew by 57% yearonyear as we launched new products expanded into new markets and entered new affiliate agreements across more verticals in particular in travel with its higher margins.
The acquisitions of Time Out Australia and Time Out Spain further contributed to our revenue growth.
Time Out Market our other business division had 3.6 million visitors in our Lisbon location in 2017 and 62% revenue growth yearonyear 2016 115%  the success of the concept as we roll it out globally offers a fantastic growth opportunity going forward.
How does Time Out intend to grow sales so rapidly in the highly competitive travel and leisure ecommerce market We know that 95% of our audience do something as a result of engaging with Time Out and that over 60% are from outside of the city  this audience is looking to spend and that is a huge potential for ecommerce.
As we are already inspiring millions of travel and leisure decisions every year we no longer just write about the best things to do in the city we increasingly make them bookable.
In 2017 our customers bought 837000 items from us up from 618000 in the previous year.
We aim to further grow bookings by rolling out ecommerce functionalities to more cities by launching multilanguage options to attract visits and bookings from new audiences by further enhancing the product categories by making more content bookable and with a website redesign focusing on a closer connection of content and ecommerce.
To complement our broad affiliates offering and further monetise traffic we have also launched exclusive products like our very successful recent restaurant gift box which sold out quickly  this is a unique product only Time Out can deliver as it is inspired by editorial curation of the best of the city.
Your audience keeps on growing  what are the key drivers First our audience values and trusts our content which is curated by professional journalists  it is this quality that attracts both locals and visitors always looking for something new and exciting to do in cities around the world.
Secondly in 2017 we have again grown our average global monthly audience reach by 39% and it now stands at 217 million.
This was driven by an increasing social media reach which helps us build our brand and drive traffic to our In 2017 we continued to drive growth for Time Out as we made substantial progress across our core areas.
Increasing revenue growth in the second half demonstrates the successful implementation of our plan to transform this business.

Our audience has further grown as a result of our global expansion namely the launch of new cities in the US and in Germany and new print magazines as well as the integration of former Time Out franchises in Australia Spain Hong Kong and Singapore into our owned and operated network.
Time Out is very well known for its magazines but is Time Out now a digital business Whilst digital revenues now account for a majority of the Groups revenue and we are excited about the consistent growth of ecommerce and Premium Profiles the physical nature of print and Time Out Market have a significant role to play in the future of Time Out as our global community chooses to use multiple channels to interact with us.
Our content is platform agnostic and we deliver it to wherever our audience wants it  through our website mobile social print Live Events or Time Out
It is this unique clicks and mortar approach that helps us raise the profile of our brand and expand our global presence.
Since the opening of Lisbon six Time Out Market locations have been announced when will the next open and can we expect more announcements Time Out Market Lisbon continues to be an incredible success story it is now Portugals most visited attraction and recognised to be at the forefront of the emerging global food hall trend.
This is a trend which has been growing significantly around the world and consumers love this democratisation of fine food and the communal feel.
We are proud to lead the charge in this sector and truly differentiate as we not only offer the best food of the city but also its culture.
This makes Time Out Market so much more than just a food hall.
The fact that Time Out Market Lisbon saw 3.6 million visitors in 2017 shows how successful and popular this format is.
As we are expanding Time Out Market globally we are set to open Time Out Market New York and Miami in 2018 followed by Chicago and Boston in 2019.
To capitalise on the exceptional growth opportunity Time Out Market offers we secured a loan of 9 million in 2017 a further 20 million in March 2018 and we continue to explore funding options.
What are the key challenges of the year ahead The industry we are operating in is challenged by the socalled duopoly Facebook and Google which is now also joined by Amazon.
The duopolys share of global advertising spend has more than doubled over the past four years and now stands at over 20%.
However what makes Time Out stand out in this competitive and fastchanging environment is its hugely trusted brand real authenticity quality content a loyal and engaged audience unique products and experiences we offer and differentiated bespoke multichannel solutions within a brandsafe environment for advertisers.
This combination of assets is difficult to replicate for these tech giants but something advertising clients and consumers increasingly seek.
We need to strengthen these assets further to continue to evolve as a digital transactional business and to get to profitability.
As for our second business division Time Out Market a key challenge will be the openings coming up of new sites in 2018 in New York and Miami and in 2019 in Chicago and Boston.
I am pleased to have a fantastic team in place who are highly experienced with managing a number of highprofile openings within a short period of time.
Time Out is 50 years old in 2018.
A lot has changed but what still remains It all began in London in 1968 when Time Out helped people explore the exciting things that happened all over the city.
50 years on this is still at the heart of everything we do we continue to inspire and enable people to make the most of the city.
But today we are present in 108 cities in 39 countries around the world.
Through all those years this iconic brand has maintained its status as the goto source of inspiration for both locals and visitors alike making Time Out the only true global marketplace for city life.
Our unique curated content written by professional journalists remains as relevant now as when it first started  it is this authentic high quality content people value in times of fake news more than ever before and that is why we are able to inspire millions of people to have a great time in cities around the world.

Time Out Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 Stock code TMO
REVIEW CONTINUED Financial performance
Reported Group revenue for the year has increased by 24% from 35.7m to 44.4m primarily through organic growth and the acquisition of Time Out franchise partners in Australia and Spain.
Growth excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency was 3.6m.
Time Out Market Limited was acquired by the Group on 14 June 2016 and therefore it has only been included in the accounts after that date.
Accounting on a proforma basis for a full year of Time Out Market in 2016 Group revenue grew by 19%.
Gross margin The overall gross margin revenue less cost of sales of the Group declined by three percentage points YoY to 56% 2016 59%.
This was predominantly driven by the traffic acquisition strategy in the ecommerce business for the hotel vertical and the expansion at a low margin of Live Events.
The declines were offset in part by the higher gross margin of the businesses acquired in Spain and Australia.
The margin in Time Out Market declined by 4.4 percentage points principally due to the opening of the Time Out Bar in Lisbon.
The bar operated directly by Time Out started in December 2016 and its first year of operation has contributed 0.8m of revenue.
Operating expenditure Group operating expenditure before exceptional costs share based payments depreciation and amortisation was 38.9m 2016 Excluding the effect of currency translation total costs grew by 5.1m of which 2.5m relates to businesses acquired.
Without the acquired businesses and at constant currency H1 operating expenditure grew by 26% year on year and declined by 1% in H2 year on year as a result of the reorganisation undertaken in June 2017.
Of
Close attention continues to be paid to costs to ensure that both cost of sales and operating expenditure and skills of teams are aligned with the potential revenue and activities of the company.
Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA represents the profit or loss before interest taxation depreciation amortisation share based payments share of associates loss and oneoff exceptional items.
Reported Adjusted EBITDA loss for the year was 14.2m 2016 10.2m loss a decline of 4.0m due to cost of sales the traffic acquisition strategy the expansion of Time Out Digital activities and a full year of costs associated with being a listed company.

The amortisation of intangible assets included 2.3m 2016 1.0m relating to acquired intangible assets.
Other intangible asset amortisation primarily amortisation of software both acquired and internally developed was 2.1m 2016 2.2m.
Net finance costs Net finance costs in 2017 of 0.8m 2016 1.1m mainly comprise interest on third party loans and the foreign exchange loss on financial assets.
The decrease in finance costs on loans is a result of the repayment of senior and mezzanine debt in 2016.
Foreign exchange The revenues and costs of Group entities reporting in dollars have been consolidated in these financial statements at an average exchange rate of 1.29 2016 1.36.
The operations reporting in euros have been consolidated at a rate of 1.14 2016 1.22.
Currency effects for the year as a whole were not significant but there was a substantial change between each half.
The impact on the revenues of the Group and its underlying revenue performance is as follows.
Underlying at constant currency % Acquisitions 2017
Revenue 16.6 1.0 6% 0.8 5% 0.3 18.7

This and other one off flows in 2017 were 2m including the seasonal growth in working capital of the business acquired in Australia.
A strong last quarter for sales in the year led to a higher level of receivables than in prior periods and is the prime cause of the increase in the underlying cash out flow.
Capital expenditure of 4.4m 2016 3.5m includes 2.4m 2016 1.8m of capitalised software development costs relating to the teams working on the website and digital platforms the cost of leasehold improvements and other equipment.
Of the leasehold improvements 1.5m was in respect of the development of new Time Out Market locations across the US in London and Porto.

Time Out Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 Stock code TMO PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES The Board sets out below the principal risks and uncertainties that the Directors consider could impact the business.
The Board continually reviews the potential risks facing the Group and the controls in place to mitigate any potential adverse impacts.
The Board also recognises that the nature and scope of risks can change and that there may be other risks to which the Group is exposed.
The list is therefore not intended to be exhaustive.
There is currently not a Risk Committee in place so the Audit Committee reviews the risk register regularly as part of its annual agenda and through discussions with management identifies new potential risks as well as suggests implementation or improvement of existing controls.
Risk Mitigation ActionControl Competition The Group operates in a highly competitive industry and the advent of new technologies and industry practices may adversely affect the Groups business results of operations and financial condition.
The Group is subject to a number of factors relating to product demand prices recognition of the Time Out brand and the ability to attract and retain new customers.
To minimise these risks the Group continues to invest significantly in the development of its digital offering to ensure that it remains innovative competitive and attractive in the markets in which it operates.
The focus on the quality of offerings means that the Group is able to respond to changes in the competitive landscape and respond to the needs of its readership audience and commercial partners.
Technological
Risk
IT Systems The Group is particularly dependent on its IT infrastructure and any system performance issues or shortcomings for example system software or infrastructure failure damage or denial of access could cause serious business interruption.
The efficient and uninterrupted operation of the systems technology and networks on which the Group relies and its ability to provide consumers with reliable realtime access to its products and services is fundamental to the success of the Groups business.
Backup facilities are in place to ensure business interruptions are minimised and internal and customer data is protected from corruption or unauthorised use.
Business recovery plans are also in place to minimise the effects of damage or denial of access to infrastructure or systems.
The Group uses third party resources to assist with these areas where necessary.
Technological
Risk
Technological
Advancements
Time Out continues to grow at a fast pace and such growth requires ever more complex and sizeable technological systems.
At the same time technology itself continues to develop.
Any failure to ensure that IT capacity and capability keep pace with the business could impair the Groups ability to grow.
To mitigate this risk the Group makes ongoing investments in IT systems security and people to ensure that they are sufficient for the needs of the business and do not become obsolete or compromised.
Privacy and Data
Risk
As the Groups digital revenue offerings grow the Group increasingly needs to gather and use customers personal data in order to transact with both businesses and customers.
Unauthorised access to customer data could lead to reputational damage compliance issues and a loss of customer confidence.
The Group relies on third party contractors and its own employees to collect personal data and to maintain its databases and therefore the Group is exposed to the risk that such data could be wrongfully appropriated lost or disclosed damaged or processed in breach of data protection regulations.
To mitigate this risk the Group intends to implement a policy which adopts ISO  principles including the development and implementation of information security policies and procedures for example password policies and remote access policies security monitoring software access policies password policies physical access limitations and detection and monitoring of fraud from internal staff.
Access to the network is protected by a firewall system supplied by
The Group also operates fraud detection systems which use various industry standard antifraud rules to prevent fraudulent transactions in real time.
The Group encrypts sensitive data such as passwords and other certain information to ensure there is an additional layer of security.
The Group will operate under the General Data Protection Regulation Regulation EU 2016679 when the regulations become enforceable in May 2018.
Significant progress has been made in respect of GDPR readiness and the Group anticipates no material issues with compliance on adoption.
Compliance with these new regulations will be included on the Group risk register going forward and risk commentary updated at year end 2018.
11 April 2018 1034 AM Proof 4 site STRATEGIC REPORT Risk Mitigation ActionControl
Environment
The Groups results of operations are affected by overall economic conditions in its key geographic markets via the demand for the content of the Groups publications and websites in those markets as well as the prices which the Group can offer to potential advertisers and customers.
If the local economy in a key market experiences a downturn the Groups publications revenues and profitability could be adversely affected.
Further the UKs exit from the European Union could lead to global political uncertainty and macroeconomic uncertainty in the UK economy as well as an impact on the availability of markets and market access across Europe.
The geographic diversity of the business and the developing breadth in the business provides some mitigation from a downturn in a specific geographical location or part of the economy.
Foreign
Exchange
Risk
A substantial portion of the Groups consolidated revenue is denominated in euros and US dollars.
Since the Group reports its financial results in sterling fluctuations in rates of exchange between sterling and the other currencies particularly euros and US dollars may have a material adverse effect on the Groups results of operations.
If sterling weakens as the UK exits the European Union it may limit the Groups ability to seek new opportunities andor operate in other currencies.
Key
Management
The Groups success depends on its key personnel particularly its senior management team and its ability to retain them and hire other qualified employees.
The loss of a significant number of key personnel may have a negative effect on the Groups ability to deliver its products in a timely manner and would amongst other things require the remaining key personnel to divert immediate and substantial attention to seeking a replacement.
In order to mitigate this risk the HR department monitors employee satisfaction through employee surveys and forums and uses the information to develop staff retention programmes.
The Remuneration Committee also seeks to ensure that rewards correspond with performance and retention.
Finally the IPO has enabled the business to launch sharebased incentives to assist in retaining key personnel.
Brand
Protection
The Group depends on its brand name and any damage to its brand or reputation could impact the ability to attract and retain customers with a resultant impact on traffic and revenues as well as impair the ability of the Group to attract employees.
The Group has brand guidelines in place which are regularly communicated to all employees and key third parties to ensure consistency of voice and approach throughout all marketing activities.
There is also a robust strategy in place for actively pursuing and defending the Time Out brand name and all supporting trademarks domain names and other intellectual property in all key markets in all relevant classes.
Furthermore the Group employs internal and external legal personnel who are experts in intellectual property to manage the trademark and domain name portfolios and there are an everincreasing number of trademarks and domain names applied for and registered across the world.
Other factors Other economic factors which may affect spending habits of consumers include but are not limited to acts of terrorism which could affect the willingness of consumers to continue existing spending habits and use of free time.
Operational
Time Out Market The Group intends to replicate the market concept in other cities across the world.
The rollout of new markets and the ongoing success of the Time Out Market in Lisbon could be negatively affected by a number of factors including Terrorist or other visitor incidents including fire crowd control or any other disaster or failure to comply with health and safety including issues relating to food poisoning or other problems with food andor beverages consumed at the Time Out market security and environmental requirements.
These incidents could affect the reputation and revenues of Time Out Market and of the Group and may result in legal proceedings against the Company TOM or another member of the Group.
The rollout of new markets may take longer than planned or ultimately not succeed due to delays in or difficulties in agreeing commercial terms with landlords problems in obtaining necessary planning permissions delays in construction or significant inflation in costs and difficulties in attracting premium restaurateurs on adequate financial terms.

AUDITORS REPORT
Report on the audit of the financial statements
In our opinion Time Out Group plcs group financial statements and company financial statements the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the groups and of the companys affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the groups loss and cash flows for the year then ended the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union the company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice United Kingdom Accounting Standards comprising FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework and applicable law and the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
We have audited the financial statements included within the Annual Report and Accounts the Annual Report which comprise the consolidated and company statements of financial position as at 31 December 2017 the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of other comprehensive income the consolidated statement of cash flows and the consolidated and company statements of changes in equity for the year then ended and the notes to the financial statements which include a description of the significant accounting policies.
Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing UK ISAs UK and applicable law.
Our responsibilities under ISAs UK are further described in the Auditors responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK which includes the FRCs Ethical Standard as applicable to listed entities and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
Our audit approach
Overall group materiality 442000 2016 357000 based on 1% of total revenues.
Overall company materiality 419000 2016 339000 based on 1% of total assets restricted to 95% of group materiality.
The focus of the group teams work was on the UK and US operations.
We received reporting from Portugal on audits of the complete financial information.
In addition specified audit procedures were performed by the group team on the other UK nonoperating subsidiaries.
Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets Group.
Recoverability of Time Out Markets set up costs Group.
Ability of the group to continue as a going concern.
Group and Company.
Capitalisation of internally generated intangible assets Group.
The scope of our audit As part of designing our audit we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements.
In particular we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.
As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.

AUDITORS REPORT
Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that in the auditors professional judgement were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement whether or not due to fraud identified by the auditors including those which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets Refer to notes 12 and 13 Goodwill is an intangible asset that arises on the acquisition of a business and reflects the portion of the consideration paid which cannot be allocated to separately identifiable acquired assets.
Goodwill is not amortised but tested for impairment at least once a year or more frequently where there is an indication that it may be impaired.
The group has also recognised both acquired and internally generated intangible assets.
Whilst these are amortised over their useful economic life there is a risk that their value may need to impaired and so they are included in the impairment testing.
We focused on this area because goodwill and intangible assets are material to the consolidated financial statements and the assumptions used in the impairment assessment are inherently subjective.
In particular the fair value less costs to sell model that forms the basis of managements assessment contains a number of judgements the most sensitive of which are the revenue projections for the group and the revenue multiple used which is based on revenue multiples of other similar groups
We assessed whether the selected revenue multiples were reasonable by comparing them to other data sources including revenue multiples from a number of similar businesses.
We also considered whether the revenue used in these calculations was reasonable in light of historic performance and industry projections.
We considered whether there had been any changes to the business or to the market environment which could increase the level of uncertainty in the forecast.
We performed sensitivities to assess the level that revenue multiples and forecast revenue would need to decrease either individually or in combination in order to indicate an impairment.
Based on the work performed we concluded that it was reasonable to conclude that the revenue forecasts and multiples would not decrease by the levels required to cause a material impairment in the model used by management.
Recoverability of Time Out Markets set up costs Refer to note 14 In the process of expanding the Time Out Markets business into new locations the group has incurred material preopening costs which have been capitalised.
There is judgement involved as to whether these assets will be recoverable in the future in particular in relation to the costs incurred of 0.9 million in London and 0.8 million in Miami both of which have been subject to objections during the planning process.
Group
We considered the accuracy and completeness of the costs by agreeing them back to supporting documentation and considered the appropriateness of capitalisation of the costs.
We have reviewed the economic forecasts of the markets to ensure that costs incurred are forecast to be recovered by the future economic benefits to flow to the group.
We have compared these forecasts to the existing market in Lisbon and also other information indicating commercial interest in these two markets Where there is uncertainty around the outcome of planning and licensing applications and appeals we have corresponded with planning advisors and external legal counsel to understand the expected outcomes of the cases.
Based on the work performed we have found that the forecasted cash flows for both the London and Miami markets indicate that the setup costs will be recovered and that managements assessment that it is still probable that planning will be approved for both sites is supported by our correspondence with external legal counsel.
11 April 2018 1034 AM Proof 4 site GOVERNANCE Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter Ability of the group to continue as a going concern Refer to note 2 For the year ended 31 December 2017 the group made a loss of 26.0 million and had a cash outflow from operating activities of 21.3 million.
The group is also expected to open a number of new market sites in the near future which will require capital expenditure.
The directors performed a going concern assessment based on their latest budgets and forecasts and taking into account the credit facility of 20 million which is available until October 2019.
The directors assessment included a number of downside sensitivities and identified mitigating actions that could be taken to reduce cash burn if necessary.
The directors concluded that it was appropriate to prepare the group and company financial statements on a going concern basis.
We considered this to be a key audit matter because of the cash outflow in the year and the potential impact on the Groups liquidity of downside risks applied to managements forecasts.
Group and Company We examined the groups cash flow forecast for the 12 month period 30 April 2019 and agreed that this are based on Board approved budgets.
We also requested the directors to extend their forecast to October 2019.
The forecast included key assumptions in relation to future revenue growth as well as capital expenditure relating to the rollout of new markets.
We tested the key assumptions in the forecast by comparing the sales growth to historic performance and agreeing the capital expenditure assumptions on the markets to lease agreements and management estimates We also tested the mathematical accuracy of the forecast.
We held discussions with management to understand the nature of downside risks and considered whether further risks should be applied to the forecasts.
We used our understanding of the group and industry to assess the possibility of such risks arising and their potential impact.
We examined documentation supporting the mitigating actions identified by management to reduce the rate of cash burn should downside risks arise.
We inspected the credit facility agreement entered into in March 2018 with Oakley Capital Investments Limited to check that it was committed until October 2019.
We examined the disclosure in note 2 and found it to be sufficient to inform members about the directors conclusions on the appropriateness of using the going concern basis of accounting.
Our conclusion on going concern is set out below.
Capitalisation of development costs Refer to note 13 We focused on this area because of the significant level of judgement by the directors involved in determining whether internal time and external costs incurred in respect of development costs satisfy the requirements of the financial reporting framework International Accounting Standard 38 Intangible assets to be capitalised including that they are separable from the other assets of the business and will provide future economic benefits for the group.
The internally generated intangible assets are all within the UK.
Group
We gained an understanding of the controls and review process over the capitalisation of development costs.
We discussed the future cash flow projections of each project with relevant personnel and obtained explanations for the assumptions made.
We have reviewed managements classification of costs between new projects improvements and maintenance expenditure.
We have assessed whether any existing assets are impaired as a result of new developments in the year.
We selected a sample of projects and reviewed managements assessment for these projects that they satisfied the recognition criteria in IAS 38.
We also tested a sample of internal costs to work systems and supporting payroll records and verified the allocation of employee costs to the correct projects and external costs to invoices.
How we tailored the audit scope We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole taking into account the structure of the group and the company the accounting processes and controls and the industry in which they operate.
The group reports its operating results and financial position in seven territories being UK USA Portugal Australia Spain Hong Kong and
The group Financial Statements are a consolidation of the groups operating businesses and central functions.
The groups operating reporting units vary significantly in size the most significant being the UK US and Portugal.
The group team performed the audits of the UK and
We also performed an audit of the complete financial information of Portugal.
We issued instructions to our Portuguese team which included guidance on the areas of focus for the audit.
We then had regular communication with them and received reporting on their work.
In addition specified audit procedures were performed on the UK nonoperating subsidiaries by the group team.
The group team assessed the appropriateness completeness and accuracy of group journals and other adjustments performed on the consolidation and obtained an understanding of the internal control environment related to the financial reporting process.

AUDITORS REPORT
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality.
We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality.
These together with qualitative considerations helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows Group financial statements
Overall materiality 442000 2016 357000.
419000 2016 339000.
How we determined it 1% of total revenues.
1% of total assets.
Rationale for benchmark applied Based on the benchmarks used in the annual report revenue is the primary measure used by the shareholders in assessing the performance of the group and is a generally accepted auditing benchmark.
We believe that total assets are the primary measure used by the shareholders in assessing the performance of the entity and is a generally accepted auditing benchmark.
The materiality has been limited to 95% of overall group materiality.
For each component in the scope of our group audit we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality.
The range of materiality allocated across components was between 152000 and 419000.
Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above 22100 Group audit 2016 17000 and 22100 Company audit 2016 17000 as well as misstatements below those amounts that in our view warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Conclusions relating to going concern We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which ISAs UK require us to report to you when the directors use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate or the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the groups and companys ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
However because not all future events or conditions can be predicted this statement is not a guarantee as to the groups and companys ability to continue as a going concern.
Reporting on other information The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors report thereon.
The directors are responsible for the other information.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and accordingly we do not express an audit opinion or except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report any form of assurance thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements our responsibility is to read the other information and in doing so consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information.
If based on the work we have performed we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors Report we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit ISAs UK require us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below.
11 April 2018 1034 AM Proof 4 site GOVERNANCE Strategic Report and Directors Report In our opinion based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors Report for the year ended 31 December 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors Report.
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors Responsibilities the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements the directors are responsible for assessing the groups and the companys ability to continue as a going concern disclosing as applicable matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the company or to cease operations or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditors report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs UK will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if individually or in the aggregate they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRCs website at www. rc. auditorsresponsibilities.
This description forms part of our auditors report.
Use of this report This report including the opinions has been prepared for and only for the companys members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose.
We do not in giving these opinions accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Other required reporting Companies Act 2006 exception reporting Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if in our opinion we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit or adequate accounting records have not been kept by the company or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us or certain disclosures of directors remuneration specified by law are not made or the company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

IAS 7 Statement of cash flows Going concern The Group made a loss after tax of 26020k 2016 loss of 18640k.
The Directors confirm they have a reasonable expectation that the Company and Group have adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future and at least 12 months from the date of signing these financial statements and consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the Company and Group financial statements.
This confirmation is made having considered the financial position of the Group on the basis of the latest budgets and forecasts the cash balance of 29.8 million at 31 December 2017 and the availability of future financing including the 20 million credit facility entered into in March 2018 committed until October 2019 to help accelerate the rollout of new markets.
As new markets are opened the Directors will explore alternative financing options from a number of potential sources.
The Directors have considered downside risks to the Groups plans together with options available to reduce the rate of cash burn in the short to medium term and assessed the potential impact these would have on the Groups liquidity.
In evaluating these risks the Directors have considered the Groups history of operating losses and the cash outflows that are expected to continue as the Group undertakes the expansion of the Time Out Market business.
New and amended standards adopted by the Group The accounting standards and policies adopted in these financial statements are consistent with those of the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016 as presented under IFRS.
No new standards amendments or interpretations effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after 1 January 2017 have had a material impact on the Group or Company.
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Time Out Group plc and all its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 December each year.
As permitted by S408 of the Companies Act 2006 the income statement of the parent Company is not presented as part of these financial statements.
The parent Companys loss for the financial year was 862k 2016 1568k loss.
The parent Company is primarily a holding company and had minimal cash flows during the year.
It did not hold any cash or cash equivalents at the beginning or end of the year.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities including structured entities over which the Group has control.
The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
In the Group financial statements the acquisition method is adopted.
Under this method the results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in the period are consolidated for the periods from or to the date on which control is passed.
The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group.
The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
The Group recognises any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition byacquisition basis either at fair value or at the noncontrolling interests proportionate share of the recognised amounts of the acquirees identifiable net assets.
Acquisitionrelated costs are expensed as incurred and presented as exceptional items.
If the business combination is achieved in stages the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirers previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date any gains or losses arising from such remeasurement are recognised in profit or loss.
11 April 2018 1034 AM Proof 4 site FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Accounting policies continued Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability is recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income.
Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.
Intercompany transactions balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated on consolidation.
When necessary amounts reported by subsidiaries have been adjusted to conform to the Groups accounting policies.
Noncontrolling interests Transactions with noncontrolling interests that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions  that is as transactions with the owners in their capacity as owners.
The difference between the fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity.
Gains or losses on disposals to noncontrolling interests are also recorded in equity.
Noncontrolling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups equity and consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination plus their share of changes in equity since that date.
Associates
An associate is an undertaking over which the Group exercises significant influence usually from 20%50% of the equity voting rights in respect of the financial and operating policy.
The Group accounts for its interests in associates using the equity method.
Under the equity method the investment in the associate is initially measured at cost.
The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Groups share of net assets of associates since the acquisition date.
If the ownership interest in an associate is reduced but significant influence is retained only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.
The income statement reflects the Groups share of the results of operations of the entity.
The statement of comprehensive income includes the Groups share of any other comprehensive income recognised by the associate.
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive the payment is established.
The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired.
If this is the case the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value and recognises the amount adjacent to share of profitloss of associates in the income statement.
Dilution gains and losses arising in investments in associates are recognised in the income statement.
Segmental reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decisionmaker.
The chief operating decisionmaker who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments has been identified as the group of key management personnel as identified in the strategic report that makes strategic decisions.
Foreign currencies The functional and presentational currency of the Group is sterling.
Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries with a functional currency which is a foreign currency are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the end of the financial period and the result of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the average exchange rate for the period.
All transactions denominated in foreign currency are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the time of the transaction.
All foreign exchange differences are taken to the income statement in the period in which they arise.
At the statement of financial position date monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the closing rate.
Upon the translation of any subsidiarys results for the year and financial position at any given year end the foreign exchange differences which may arise are recognised directly in other comprehensive income as currency translation differences.
Property plant and equipment The cost of property plant and equipment includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets at rates calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset over its expected useful life as follows 25887 11 April 2018 1034 AM
Time Out Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 Stock code TMO Accounting policies continued Computer equipment  over three years on a straight line basis Fixtures and fittings  over five years on a straight line basis Leasehold improvements  over the lease term or useful life whichever is shorter The Group operates in jurisdictions which have set useful lives for certain types of assets and where different local guidelines override the Group policies mentioned above.
However the Group confirms that this treatment does not materially change the accounts.
The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at the end of each reporting period.
Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over Time Out Group plcs interest in the net fair value of the net identifiable assets liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree and the fair value of the noncontrolling interest in the acquiree.
For the purpose of impairment testing goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the cash generating unit CGU that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Each CGU to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment.
The carrying value of the CGU containing the goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount which is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs of disposal.
Any impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.
When the ownership of an acquired company is less than 100% the noncontrolling interest is measured at either the proportion of the recognised net assets attributable to the noncontrolling interest or at the fair value of the acquired company at the date of acquisition.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Intangible assets Trademarks and copyrights Trademark and copyright assets are amortised over a period of 15 years from the month of acquisition.
Development costs Development costs comprising costs incurred relating to websites and other digital platform elements are written off over a period of two three or four years depending on the relevant project.
The cost of internally generated and acquired technology is recognised as an intangible asset providing it satisfies all of the conditions set out in the research and development policy below.
Assets are subsequently measured and amortised on a straightline basis over their useful economic lives from the month in which the expenditure is incurred.
Service concession arrangements The concession granted by the Municipality of Lisbon to occupy and operate an area within the Mercado da Ribeira in Lisbon is accounted for as a service concession arrangement under IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements.
The present value of all payments to the Municipality are capitalised and recognised as a separate intangible asset and a corresponding obligation is recognised.
The intangible asset is amortised on a straightline basis over the life of the concession arrangement.
Customer relationships and other intangible assets These intangible assets are comprised of customer and advertiser relationships and internally generated software related to the US business acquired in 2014 reacquired tradename rights and customer relationships relating to the Portuguese businesses acquired in 2015 and 2016 respectively as well as the new assets which will be created relating to Australia and Spain.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 25887 11 April 2018 1034 AM Proof 4 site FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Accounting policies continued The fair value of these assets was determined by agreement between the Directors and an independent valuation consultant and was conducted in order to comply with IAS 3 Business Combinations.
These assets are amortised over five years internally generated software and customer relationships 15 years advertiser relationships or two years reacquired tradename rights.
Research and development Expenditure on the research phase of an internal project is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Development costs incurred on specific projects are capitalised when all of the following conditions are satisfied Completion of the asset is technically feasible so that it will be available for use or sale The Group intends to complete the asset and use or sell it The Group has the ability to use or sell the asset and it will generate probable future economic benefits There are adequate technical financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the asset and The expenditure attributable to the asset during its development can be measured reliably.
Development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalisation are expensed as incurred.
The cost of an internally generated asset comprises all directly attributable costs necessary to create produce and prepare the asset to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
Directly attributable costs include employee other than Director costs incurred along with third party costs.
Impairment of nonfinancial assets Nonfinancial assets that are not ready to use are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are largely independent cash inflows CGUs.
Prior impairments of nonfinancial assets other than goodwill are reviewed for possible reversal at each reporting date.
Government grants Grants from the government are recognised at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and that the group will comply with all attached conditions.
Government grants relating to costs are deferred and recognised in the income statement over the period necessary to match them with the costs that they are intended to compensate.
Government grants relating to property plant and equipment are included in noncurrent liabilities as deferred government grants and they are credited to the income statement on a straightline basis over the expected lives of the related assets.
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories at fair value through profit or loss loans and receivables and available for sale.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired.
Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading.
A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the shortterm.
Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges.
Assets in this category are classified as current assets if expected to be settled within 12 months otherwise they are classified as noncurrent.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They are included in current assets except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period.
These are classified as noncurrent assets.
The Groups loans and receivables comprise of trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet.
11 April 2018 1034 AM
Time Out Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 Stock code TMO Accounting policies continued Availableforsale financial assets Availableforsale financial assets are nonderivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories.
They are included in noncurrent assets unless the investment matures or management intends to dispose of it within 12 months of the end of the reporting period.
Recognition and measurement Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the tradedate  the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs are expensed in the income statement.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Availableforsale financial assets and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value.
Loans and receivables are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the financial assets at fair value through profit or loss category are presented in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Changes in the fair value of monetary and nonmonetary securities classified as availablefor sale are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Financial assets are derecognised when the right to receive cash flows from the assets has expired or has been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership.
When securities classified as availableforsale are sold or impaired the accumulated fair value adjustments previously taken to reserves are included in the income statement.
Offsetting financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company or the counterparty.
Impairment of financial assets Assets carried at amortised cost The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset a loss event and that loss event or events has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
Evidence of impairment may include indications that the debtors or a group of debtors is experiencing significant financial difficulty default or delinquency in interest or principal payments the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation and where observable data indicate that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults.
For loans and receivables the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
If
As a practical expedient the Group may measure impairment on the basis of an instruments fair value using an observable market price.
If in a subsequent period the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised such as an improvement in the debtors credit rating the reversal of the previously recognised impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
Assets classified as availableforsale The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 25887 11 April 2018 1034 AM Proof 4 site FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Accounting policies continued Financial liabilities Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the entity after deducting all of its financial liabilities.
Where the contractual obligations of financial instruments including preference shares are equivalent to a similar debt instrument those financial instruments are classified as financial liabilities.
Where the contractual terms of preference shares do not have any terms meeting the definition of a financial liability then this is classed as an equity instrument.
Investments
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
The Company assesses these investments for impairment wherever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable.
If any such indication of impairment exists the Company makes an estimate of the recoverable amount.
If the recoverable amount is less than the value of the investment the investment is considered to be impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value after making due allowance for obsolete and slow moving items.
Inventories
Cost is determined on a firstin firstout FIFO method.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for merchandise sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business.
If collection is expected in one year or less or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer they are classified as current assets.
If not they are presented as noncurrent assets.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less provision for impairment.
Cash and bank balances Cash and bank balances comprises cash and cash equivalents being cash at bank and in hand and shortterm deposits with a maturity of three months or less and monies held in restricted accounts and deposits which represent cash held by the Group in accounts with conditions that restrict the use of these monies by the Group and as such does not meet the definition of cash and cash equivalents.
Line of credit Certain of the Groups accounts receivable balances are assigned with recourse to financial institutions.
In return the Group receives a cash advance of 80%85% of eligible accounts receivable.
Both financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised with regards to this arrangement.
Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity only to the extent that they do not meet the definition of a financial liability.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares of options are shown in equity as a deduction net of tax from the proceeds.
Trade payables Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers.
Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer.
If
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
11 April 2018 1034 AM
Time Out Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 Stock code TMO Accounting policies continued
All interest bearing loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down.
In this case the fee is deferred until the drawdown occurs.
To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised over the period to which it relates.
Preference shares that are mandatorily redeemable on a specific date are classified as liabilities.
The dividends on these preference shares are recognised in the income statement as an interest expense.
Borrowing costs General and specific borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition construction or production of qualifying assets which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale are added to the cost of those assets until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on profits for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of temporary differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
In this case the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.
Current and deferred tax The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.
The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation.
It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
However deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided on taxable temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries associates and joint arrangements except for any deferred tax liability where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Generally the Group is unable to control the reversal of the temporary difference for associates.
Only where there is an agreement in place that gives the Group the ability to control the reversal of the temporary difference is the deferred tax liability not recognised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities and there is no intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
Tax grants related to research and development expenditure are recognised under IAS 12 against expenditure and are recognised when reasonably certain estimates can be made.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 25887 11 April 2018 1034 AM Proof 4 site FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Accounting policies continued Employee benefit costs The Group contributes to certain employees personal pension plans on a defined contribution basis.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group and employee pay fixed contributions on a mandatory contractual or voluntary basis depending on the location to a third party financial provider.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense in the income statement when due.
Sharebased payments The Group operates a number of equitysettled sharebased compensation plans under which the entity receives services from employees as consideration for equity instruments options of the Group.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense.
The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted.
At the end of each reporting period the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the nonmarket vesting conditions and service conditions.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates if any in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
When the options are exercised the Company issues new shares.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as a capital contribution.
The fair value of employee services received measured by reference to the grant date fair value is recognised over the vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings with a corresponding credit to equity in the parent entity accounts.
The social security contributions payable in connection with the grant of the share options is considered an integral part of the grant itself and the charge will be treated as a cashsettled transaction.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pretax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.
The increase in provision due to the passage of time is recognised as an interest expense.
Revenue recognition Revenue which is stated net of sales tax represents the amounts derived from the sale of goods and services which fall within the Groups ordinary activities.
Advertising revenue is recognised at the time the advertisement is published.
Subscription and Premium Profiles revenue is recognised evenly over the length of each subscription.
Circulation revenue is recognised at the time of sale.
Provision is made for returns of distributor returns.
Ticket revenues for Time Out events are recognised in the month of the event.
Tickets for Time Out offers and commissions for sales of tickets to external events and experiences are recognised at the point of sale.
Licenceroyalty revenue is recognised over the contract period in accordance with the substance of the underlying agreement.
Where these revenues are uncertain they are recognised only on receipt.
Market related revenue is predominantly turnover related rent from restaurants in the markets and is recognised as the turnover is earned by the subletting restaurants.
These are treated as operating leases and are recognised in the income statement on a straightline basis over the period of the lease.
Interest income and expenses Interest income and expenses are recognised using the effective interest method.

Operating leases Where substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are not transferred to the Group the total rentals payable under the lease are charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straightline basis over the lease term.
The aggregate benefit of any lease incentive is recognised as a reduction of the rental expense over the lease term on a straightline basis.
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to income on a straightline basis over the lease term even if the payments are not made on such a basis.
Finance leases Leases of property plant and equipment where the Group as lessee has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Finance leases are capitalised at the leases inception at the fair value of the leased property or if lower the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The corresponding rental obligations net of finance charges are included in other shortterm and longterm payables.
Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost.
The finance cost is charged to the income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.
The property plant and equipment acquired under finance leases is depreciated over the assets useful life or over the shorter of the assets useful life and the lease term if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership at the end of the lease term.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the financial statements where given their nature or size it is necessary to do so to provide further understanding of the financial performance of the Group.
Exceptional items mainly relate to costs associated with a material restructuring including termination payments and associated legal fees costs relating to acquisitions including legal and consultancy fees costs arising from significant office moves and the revaluation of minority interests.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of the Groups consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the end of the reporting period.
However uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in future periods.
The key assumptions and judgements concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are described below.
The Group based its assumptions estimates and judgements on parameters available when the consolidated statements were prepared.
Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments however may change due to market changes or circumstances arising beyond the control of the Group.
Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.
The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment i. which is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.
The fair value less costs to sell calculation is based on available data from binding sales transactions in an arms length transaction of similar assets or observable market prices less incremental costs for disposing of the asset.
The value in use calculation is based on a discounted cash flow model where appropriate.
The cash flows are derived from the business plan for the next five years and do not include restructuring activities that the Group is not yet committed to or significant future investments that will enhance the assets performance of the cash generating unit being tested.
The recoverable amount is most sensitive to the discount rate used for the discounted cash flow model as well as the expected future cash inflows and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes.
The estimation uncertainty exists here due to a number of estimation factors applied to any model used.
Careful judgement by the Directors is applied when deciding whether the recognition requirements for capitalised development costs have been met under IAS 38 Intangible Asset.
Before capitalisation commences on a specific project a business plan is prepared and approved in order to ascertain that the project meets all criteria of the standard as well as to determine the assets useful life.
Judgements and assumptions are made using all information known at the end of the reporting period.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 25887 11 April 2018 1034 AM Proof 4 site FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Accounting policies continued c Business combinations When acquiring a business the Group has to make judgements and best estimates about the fair value allocation of the purchase price and the fair value of any contingent deferred consideration.
Judgement is applied in determining what part of a business transaction relates to the acquisition of that business.
Parts of a business transaction that do not relate to the acquisition for example employee costs are accounted for in accordance with the relevant accounting standard.
When investing in the expansion of new Time Out Market sites the Group makes a judgement as to when the new site has passed feasibility and reached development stage.
During feasibility all costs associated with the new site are expensed.
When a site reaches development stage which is normally determined following the agreement of Heads of Terms for a new lease applicable costs incurred are capitalised as an item of property plant and equipment.
Impairment reviews are performed on the preopening expenditure balances at least every six months.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted The following new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2018 and as such have not been adopted in these financial statements but have been adopted by the Group from that date.
None of these are expected to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
IFRS 9 Financial instruments addresses the classification measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities.
It replaces the guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification and measurement of financial instruments.
IFRS 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement categories for financial assets amortised cost fair value through other comprehensive income and fair value through profit or loss.
The basis of classification depends on the entitys business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.
Investments in equity instruments are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss with the irrevocable option at inception to present changes in fair value in other comprehensive income not recycling.
An expected credit losses model replaces the incurred loss impairment model used in IAS 39.
For financial liabilities there are no changes to classification and measurement except for the recognition of changes in own credit risk in other comprehensive income for liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss.
IFRS 9 introduces changes to the requirements for hedge effectiveness.
The Directors anticipate that the classification and measurement basis for its financial assets and liabilities will be largely unchanged by adoption of IFRS 9.
The main impact of adopting IFRS 9 is likely to arise from the implementation of the expected loss model.
The expected impact at 1 January 2018 is to increase retained earnings by 52k.
No material impact on results for future periods is expected.
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers replaces IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 Construction contracts and related interpretations and deals with revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful information to users of financial statements about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entitys contracts with customers.
Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good or service.
Following a review of existing contractual arrangements the directors anticipate there will be no material impact for the groups revenue streams.
The following standard is not yet effective and has not been adopted by the Group IFRS 16 Leases applies for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
It replaces the current leasing standard IAS 17 and requires all leases to be treated in a consistent way to the current rules on finance leases requiring all leases with limited exceptions to be disclosed in the statement of financial position.
The most significant effect of the new requirements will be an increase in lease assets and financial liabilities.
IFRS 16 changes the nature of expenses related to those leases replacing the straightline operating lease expense with a depreciation charge for the lease asset included within operating costs and an interest expense on the lease liability included within finance costs.
The group is working towards the implementation of IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019.
Adoption of this new standard is likely to have an impact on the group and the Directors are yet to assess the impact.

Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the Groups interest in net fair value of the net identifiable assets liabilities and contingent liabilities of the business acquired.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the cash generating units CGUs that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
The Groups CGUs consist of Digital Print and Market.
This represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
There is no goodwill in respect to the Groups international segment.
Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment.
The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount which is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs of disposal.
Any impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.
An exercise was undertaken to establish whether there was any impairment of goodwill at 31 December 2017 determined by comparison of the carrying value to the fair value of the CGUs less costs of disposal using a market approach and assumptions reflecting a market participant view.
The valuation applies multiples of 5.0x to 2017 Digital revenues including acquired businesses 8.0x 2017 Market revenues and 1.0x to 2018 forecast Print revenues including acquired businesses which are based upon sensitised benchmarks for comparable businesses.
The 2018 revenues were taken from the latest forecasts approved by the Board.
For the Digital CGU the key assumptions were the growth in advertising revenues the number of transacting members and the average revenue per user.
For the Market CGU the key assumptions were relating to new markets worldwide and the continuing growth of the Lisbon market.
For the Print CGU the key assumption was the ability of the Group to maintain print advertising revenues during the transition to digital.
Since the forecast future revenues are based on significant unobservable inputs the fair value less costs of disposal of the goodwill is classified as a level 3 fair value.
A full sensitivity analysis has not been disclosed as management believes that any reasonable change in assumptions would not cause the carrying value of the Digital or Market CGUs to exceed their recoverable amounts.
For the Print CGU which has the lowest amount of headroom if either revenues decline by 18% in the next 12 months or the multiple used decreased to .82x it would most likely lead to an impairment of the goodwill of that segment.
The Company has no goodwill 2016 nil.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 25887 11 April 2018 1034 AM Proof 4 site FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Financial risk management and policies Financial risk factors and management The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks market risk credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
Foreign currency The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk as it operates in overseas markets.
The Groups realised loss on foreign exchange for the year was 246k 2016 250k gain.
The Group does not hedge its foreign currency risk as the majority of the Groups receivables payables and borrowings are denominated in the functional currency of the relevant entity.
Consequently there are no material currency exposures to disclose 2016 nil.
A sensitivity analysis was conducted at the end of the year ending 31 December 2017 in order to understand the exposure of the Groups income statement to currency fluctuations.
The analysis used the actual monthly average rates and appreciateddepreciated each of the rates by 10%.
The main assumptions revolve around this 10% adjustment to the rates which was applied linearly across the months instead of for a specific time.
The effects of the analysis showed that if the euro and US dollar had appreciated by 10% during the year reported revenue would be 47270k and the adjusted EBITDA loss would be 15071k.
If conversely the euro and US dollar had depreciated by 10% during the year reported revenue would be 41987k and adjusted EBITDA loss would be 13524k.
Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the Group.
In order to minimise this risk the Group endeavours to only deal with companies which are demonstrably creditworthy.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is the value of the outstanding trade receivables.
The management do not consider that there is any concentration of risk within trade receivables.
The Group puts provisions in place for specific known bad debts.
In addition further provisions are made based on historical customer payment trends current local market conditions and the normal average time taken to pay in each individual country.
An analysis of the Groups trade receivables and provision for bad debts is included in note 18.
The maximum credit risk exposure of the Group is the gross carrying value of each of its financial assets.
As well as credit risk on accounts receivable balances with customers credit risk arises on cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions.
For banks and financial institutions only reputable institutions with a strong independently rated credit rating are used.
Liquidity risk Cash flow forecasting is performed by the operating entities of the Group and aggregated by Group finance.
Group finance monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs whilst maintaining sufficient headroom to meet any repayment requirements.
In June 2016 the Group raised gross proceeds of 90m from the IPO process.
This funding was partially used to repay the existing shareholder debt at the time of listing.
The remainder of the proceeds funded investment in the business.
The maturity profile of the Groups borrowings is set out in note 22.
The table below analyses the groups nonderivative financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.
Derivative financial liabilities are included in the analysis if their contractual maturities are essential for an understanding of the timing of the cash flows.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.

Lines of credit are subject to increases in the Bank of England base rate and both the Time Out Market and Time Out Spain loans are subject to increases in EURIBOR but all other debt is at a fixed rate.
The Group has not completed a sensitivity analysis for this risk because the low debt levels would result in an immaterial impact to the accounts.
Capital risk management The Groups capital management objective is to ensure the Groups ability to continue as a going concern so that it can provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders.
To meet this objective the Group reviews the budgets and forecasts on a regular basis to ensure there is sufficient capital to meet the needs of the Group.
The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders equity as set out in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
All working capital requirements are financed from existing cash resources and borrowings.
Financial instruments Fair values The table below illustrates the fair values of all financial assets and liabilities held by the Group at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016.
Loans and receivables are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method and the carrying value in all cases approximates to the fair value.
The Groups financial liability for the option over the noncontrolling interests of MCMercados da Capital LDA is measured at fair value through profit or loss.
The initial recognition as part of the acquisition of Time Out Market Limited was at fair value and subsequent changes in fair value are charged to the Income Statement.
All other liabilities including loans and trade and other payables are held at amortised cost.
After initial fair value recognition these instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
The carrying value of these liabilities approximates to the fair value.
