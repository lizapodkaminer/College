STATEMENT
On behalf of the Board I am very pleased to report excellent progress in pursuit of our ambition to become a leading global retailer of musical instruments and equipment.
When writing this statement last year our revenue growth expectation for the year ahead was 37% and the 58% growth we actually achieved reflects the huge effort made by our staff right across the business from the Board of Directors and senior management through to our customer service and warehouse teams.
International growth of 124% has been particularly pleasing and this is an area in which we will continue to invest significant effort and resource to improve and increase our global reach building on the early success of our recently launched Swedish and German distribution operations.
Notwithstanding the investment necessary for our next phase of expansion the Board remains focused on delivering profitable growth and as such is pleased to announce an operating profit of 2.6m which is a 1.7m 192% improvement on FY16s underlying operating profit adjusted to remove oneoff IPO costs.
This translates into net profit of 2.3m and earnings per share of 11.5 pence.
In many ways this has been a transformational year for the business and to effectively manage further growth and operational complexities the Group formed an Operational Board on 1 March 2017 to support and complement the plc Board comprising a wide breadth and depth of operational and commercial experience.
To ensure we remain positioned for further growth the Group requires additional head office capacity and the Board is delighted to announce a property acquisition that provides an excellent longterm solution to our growth needs in our home city of York.
In 2012 private equity firm Key Capital Partners invested into the business and in October 2016 sold its final shareholding.
On behalf of the Board I would like to thank them and Peter Armitage who represented Key Capital on our Board for their efforts and support over the last four years.
Im also delighted to welcome new institutions and individuals onto our share register as we embark on the next chapter in the Gear4music growth story.
Given the investments scheduled for the current year to support continued growth the Board has decided not to declare a dividend for FY17 but will again review its dividend policy in the next financial year.
Finally I would like to again express my sincere thanks and appreciation to the extended Gear4music team for their commitment and hard work.
It is their passion and knowledge that provides such a strong proposition for our customers and has helped to make our second year as a public company such a success.
Ken Ford Chairman and NonExecutive Director 4 July 2017 It has been an excellent year with significant progress in many areas.
We are delivering on our strategic priorities and are confident in the outlook for the Group.

I am delighted to report on a year that saw record sales and profits whilst continuing to invest in the key strategic areas that further improve our customer proposition.
Andrew Wass
Chief Executive Officer
Introduction
When we joined AIM in June 2015 we were very confident that with continued targeted investment of the funds from our IPO we could build on the 24m revenues we had achieved in FY15 by improving our customer proposition through strategic investment into staff systems inventory and marketing and expanding our presence in Europe.
I am thrilled that we have surpassed those expectations having more than doubled our revenues to 56m whilst increasing profitability to an alltime high.

Andrew Wass
Chief Executive Officer
Investing for the future Our recent focus has been on improving our customer proposition alongside removing the next layer of barriers to growth by ensuring our operational facilities and systems can support our medium and longterm ambitions.
Office space Our staff are central to our success and in order to build our teams and support the expansion of the business we have an immediate requirement for additional UK office space.
As such we are very pleased to announce the 5.3m freehold acquisition of a 50000 square foot property at Holgate Park in York which will become our longterm UK headquarters.
The new site will provide the flexibility and capacity we require for ongoing growth whilst causing minimal upheaval for existing staff.
The acquisition will be 100% debt funded with new debt facilities providing significant cost savings when compared with leasing an equivalent building should one have been available and allowing for further expansion as required.
To ease the transitional impact as we grow into the property we have agreed a shortterm leaseback arrangement with the vendor CPPGroup Plc for half of the building and the Board expects this will cover our interest costs for the first 12 months following completion on 30 June 2017.
The estimated financial impact has been considered in more detail in the Financial review on page 21.
Distribution expansion Vacating our current office will increase our space for UK warehousingrelated activities enabling the business to continue to extract good value from the existing site until the lease expires in June 2020.
A core part of our growth strategy has been to invest in expanding our presence and further enhancing the customer service proposition in Europe.
Having delivered 124% growth in European revenues during the year now representing 38% of the Groups revenue we remain committed to continued investment thereby underlining our confidence in the regions longterm strategic value to the Group in helping us to build scale and shareholder value.
Our Swedish distribution centre became operational in November 2016 and I am pleased to report is performing well.
We have successfully reduced our delivery timescales across Scandinavia and reduced our courier costs across a wide range of products improving the overall customer offer.
Our German distribution centre began dispatching orders at the end of February 2017 and will be scaled up throughout the year to enhance our proposition across central Europe whilst providing additional distribution capacity.
Showrooms
On 8 May 2017 we opened a showroom attached to our Swedish distribution centre and in addition to serving the local Stockholm market it is already helping us to secure new procurement opportunities.
For example we have recently been appointed as the Scandinavian distributor for Behringer one of the worlds largest music equipment brands.
We expect to open our German showroom by Autumn 2017.
Systems development The acquisition of our software development team completed on 1 January 2017 and is already allowing us to achieve more react faster to developing trends and further scale our systems to ensure our growth is underpinned by a robust classleading ecommerce platform.
Examples of new features deployed during FY17 include the integration of multiple hubs across many countries to automatically select the most appropriate dispatch location international click and collect shopping basket and checkout enhancements mobile website improvements and website cloudification.

Gear4music Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 International expansion In addition to launching our European distribution network we have enabled delivery to another 150 countries during the last year and whilst at the early stages of development it is clear our business model is relevant to customers all around the world.
As the year progresses we will develop our worldwide proposition and increase our international presence wherever there is an opportunity.
Product range extension Ownbrand products continue to be a key component of our success and I am extremely pleased with the progress we have made adding new products and building on existing ranges to increase our ownbrand revenue by 58% during the year to 14.5m.
Across all our ranges we currently list more than 37000 products up 37% since IPO but we still see opportunities to grow this significantly and will achieve this by further expanding our team of specialist buyers.
Intelligent marketing With in excess of 12 million website visitors conversion rates improving by 47 bps active customer numbers increasing to more than 339000 and 39% more repeat customers than a year earlier our marketing strategy has been highly effective.
However there is much more to achieve and our focus for the year ahead will be on improving our social media activities particularly on mobile and delivering a more personalised experience for our existing customers and website visitors.
Current trading and outlook We have a strong record of targeted investment driving growth and shareholder returns.
Our momentum across the Group but particularly in Europe gives us the confidence to accelerate investment in infrastructure in order to scale up further.
The associated investment of c.
1 million will mean profitability will be more H2 weighted for the current year.
The business continues to trade in line with our expectations and our current investment strategy reinforces the confidence we have in our prospects for this year and beyond.

Change % UK revenue 34865 26016 34% International revenue 21263 9473 124% Revenue 56128 35489 58% Revenue increased by 20.6m 58% on FY16 building on growth of 46% and 37% in the previous two years.
Revenue growth was 73% in the first half of the year and 50% in the second half when growth began to be measured against H2 FY16 revenue growth by which time the IPOgrowth capital deployed in the business was having a positive impact.
As such the Board also monitors twoyear revenue growth and going forward will report on this metric.
Revenue growth from FY15 to FY17 was 132% compared to 100% between FY14 and FY16.
Growth in the wellestablished UK market continues to be strong at 34% FY16 39% but was outstripped by international growth which increased 124% and accounted for 38% of Group revenues compared to 27% in FY16 and 23% in FY15.
In FY17 the Group began shipping outside of Europe as part of our plans to identify potential areas of new opportunity with these revenues accounting for less than 0.5% of total revenue.
The UKs EU Referendum vote and subsequent weakening of Sterling created currencyrelated revenue and margin opportunities as our products became cheaper in Europe although our European revenue had already grown at 138% over the first four months of FY17 that preceded the vote.

Change % Otherbrand product revenue 39351 24842 58% Ownbrand product revenue 14449 9164 58% Other revenue 2328 1483 57% Revenue 56128 35489 58% We are particularly pleased with the progress made in our ownbrand business.
Sourcing ownbrand products takes time and the opportunity was highlighted as a mediumterm aspiration upon IPO so it is reassuring to see revenue growth catch up and match the growth in otherbranded product revenue.
Ownbrand revenue growth has increased from 27% in FY15 to 33% in FY16 and 58% this year and the proportion of revenue that came from ownbrand products in FY17 was flat at 25.7% FY16 25.8%.
Other revenue comprises carriage income warranty revenue and commissions earned on facilitating pointofsales credit for retail customers.
Gross profit
FY16
Change % Gross profit 15145 9186 65% Gross margin 27.0% 25.9% 1.1ppts The strong revenue performance contributed to a 6.0m gross profit increase on last year with the gross margin improving from 25.9% to 27.0% buoyed by improved ownbrand product revenue growth and exchange rate fluctuations creating pricing and margin opportunities.
Some productintake prices increased during FY17 due to the weakening of Sterling relative to the US Dollar.
However strong revenue growth enables further negotiations with suppliers and the leveraging of economies of scale to reduce the impact.
Otherbranded products are predominantly purchased in Sterling and are therefore less affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.
Local distribution centres will reduce delivery costs to customers in those home countries and adjacent territories although reinvestment in our customer proposition will mean these savings will be largely passed on to the customer.

Statements statement there will be an initial overhead investment phase involving upfront additional costs being incurred that take time to generate added value.
These costs will be evident in H1 FY18.
Marketing costs in FY17 increased 51% on FY16 to 4.66m FY16 3.08m compared with the 58% increase in revenue.
This includes investment into European markets to build brand recognition where the return is lower than in the UK.
Marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue reduced from 8.7% to 8.3%.
In FY17 labour costs increased 55% to 4.29m FY16 2.77m as headcount increased to support current and future growth with investment across the central functions in Europe and in senior management appointments.
Total labour costs as a percentage of revenue reduced from 7.8% to 7.6% and this will increase in H1 FY18 based on current labour cost run rates.
The European distribution centres incurred 0.48m of costs expensed as they became operational partway through the year and began to scale up.
The fullyear cost effect of these investments and associated benefits will be evident in FY18.
FY17 underlying EBITDA of 3.62m equates to 6.4% of total revenue compared to 4.7% last year.
Exceptional administrative expenses of 606000 in FY16 related to costs incurred in relation to the IPO and as such did not repeat in FY17.
Financial expenses in FY16 included 233000 of interest on privateequity loan notes that were settled in full on IPO in June 2015.
Reported profit before tax improved from breakeven last year to a 2.64m profit this year which translates into an EPS of 11.5 pence diluted EPS of 11.4 pence.
Cash flow and net debt The cash flow statement for the financial year reflects the Group continuing to deploy the growth capital raised on IPO to generate returns by investing in stock and the ecommerce platform to improve the customer proposition and drive revenue.

Nonadjusting event after the reporting period On 8 May 2017 the Group exchanged contracts to acquire the freehold of a 50000 square foot property at Holgate Park in York with completion agreed for 30 June 2017.
The purchase price is 5.3m with 70% of the price funded by a mortgage at 2.04% above LIBOR on an initial fiveyear term.
A second fiveyear term loan will be drawn for 1.80m at 2.85% above LIBOR.
On 18 May 2017 the Group completed a placing of 610000 new Ordinary shares and issued 100782 new Ordinary shares pursuant to the full and final exercise of a warrant instrument.
This resulted in gross proceeds of 4349000 and net cash into the business of 4178000.
More detail is provided on page 67.
Dividends
The Board remains confident in the cash generative nature of the core business but in light of the debtfinanced acquisition of the freehold head office premises and other planned investments to support future growth the Board does not consider it appropriate to declare a dividend at this time.
However the Board will review the shareholder distribution policy during the financial year ending 28 February 2018.

PEOPLE
We have a strong committed experienced management team working alongside passionate staff with indepth knowledge of their specialist area of focus.
Our team As at 28 February 2017 we employed 259 people across three countries and many of them have firsthand musical instrument and equipment knowledge playing in bands and producing their own music.
Ongoing product training is routinely undertaken to ensure staff have relevant and uptodate knowledge to enable them to advise customers.
Multilingual support for overseas customers in nonEnglish speaking countries continues to be a key investment focus and a prerequisite for many of the Groups dealership agreements when selling outside the UK.
Operational Board In many ways this has been a transformational year for the business and to effectively manage further growth and operational complexities the Group formed an Operational Board on 1 March 2017 to support and complement the Plc Board comprising a wide breadth and depth of operational and commercial experience.
The Operational Board meets at least once each month to analyse and discuss operational and commercial matters and to identify any material matters for escalation to the Plc Board.

The Board recognise that certain risks and uncertainties can have significant rewards for the prospects of the business and as such require careful identification evaluation and management.
The Board takes overall responsibility for risk management with a focus on evaluating the nature and extent of significant risks and formulating mitigations around the risks required to be taken in order to deliver the strategic objectives.
The Audit Committee has responsibility for overseeing the effectiveness of appropriate risk management processes and internal control systems.
More detail of these processes is setout in the Corporate Governance section.
Risk Description Mitigation RAPID GROWTH The Groups business has grown rapidly.
Operations and practices adopted at earlier stages of the Groups development may be inappropriate for a business of an increased size and scale.
The Group may need to expand and enhance its infrastructure and technology and improve its operational and financial systems and procedures and controls in order to be able to match its anticipated growth.
The Group may face challenges in matching the pace of its expansion with corresponding improvements and enhancements in its systems controls and procedures.
The Group will also need to expand train and manage its growing employee base.
As detailed in the Corporate Governance section on pages 30 to 33 the Executive team and the Board actively monitors and responds so as to maintain systems and practices that are appropriate for the operations and scale of the Group.
The Group has recruited into key management positions and on 1 March 2017 formed an Operational Board to support the Plc Board.
The Group has expanded its finance function with the addition of two management accountants providing greater capacity and better segregation of duties further improving the control environment.
The purpose of this section is to focus on the principal risks and uncertainties to our business model that could impact on our achieving our strategic objectives and our future performance.

Risk Description Mitigation
JURISDICTIONS
The Groups expansion into new jurisdictions may not be successful.
Further expansion into markets outside the UK would expose the Group to a variety of risks including different regulatory requirements complications with staffing and managing foreign operations variations in consumer behaviour fluctuations in currency exchange rates potential political and economic instability potential difficulties in enforcing contracts and intellectual property rights the potential for higher rates of fraud and adverse tax consequences.
The Directors have limited experience of the legal and regulatory regimes of jurisdictions outside the UK and their consequences for the Groups business.
In addition the Group will likely have to compete in new jurisdictions with companies already operating in the relevant market which may understand the local market better than the Group.
To the extent that the Group overestimates the potential of a new geographic market incorrectly judges the timing of the development of a new geographic market or fails to anticipate the differences between a new geographic market and the UK the Groups attempt to expand into new geographic markets may be unsuccessful.
The Board will routinely direct management to seek professional input into any such major developments.
Advances into Europe will be in a measured and capitalefficient manner.
The Group has set up local subsidiaries in Sweden and Germany and recruited local management familiar with local laws and regulations.
TECHNOLOGICAL
CHANGES
Unless the Group is able to respond to technological advances e. build andor maintain a competitive advantage.
The Group continues to allocate a significant ongoing annual software development budget and in FY17 brought the development team inhouse to increase control and efficiency.
DISTRIBUTION
CENTRES
In FY16 the Group was reliant on a single distribution centre and warehouse.
This dependency has been partly mitigated in FY17 by the Group opening two further distribution centres and warehouses all holding stock for delivery directly to customers.
Any disruption to distribution centres efficient operation may therefore have an effect on the Groups business.
Distribution centres may suffer prolonged power or equipment failures failures in its information technology systems or networks or damage from fires floods other disasters or other unforeseen events which may not be covered by or may exceed the Groups insurance coverage.
The Group now operates from three locations.
The Group in conjunction with its insurance broker ensures sufficient and appropriate insurance cover is in place.
This includes Business Interruption cover.
The Group has a formal disaster recovery plan in place that details actions in specific situations.

ONWARD
DISTRIBUTION
TO CUSTOMERS AND LOGISTICS The supply of product to customers in a timely manner is critical to the success of the Group.
The Group therefore operates its own warehouses run by senior management that have many years of experience in the sector.
Any rapid increase in revenue may require further expansion of current warehouse space.
There is a risk that the Group may experience interruptions to the operation of these logistics and distribution networks that could prevent the timely or proper delivery of products which could damage the Groups reputation and deter customers prospective customers suppliers andor prospective suppliers.
The Group has recently opened two more distribution centres with their own local logistics relationships thereby reducing the dependency on any single site or local network.
There is a continuous monitoring of capacity at the warehouses and there is a step plan in place that the Board believes should allow the Group to fulfil an increasing number of orders from the existing site.
The Group maintains multiple delivery service providers to reduce the dependency on any single provider and tracks service level agreements on an ongoing basis.
This provides system flexibility to switch providers within a matter of days if required.
CHANGE TO SEARCH ENGINES
Changes to search engines algorithms or terms of service could cause the Groups websites to be excluded from or ranked lower in natural search results.
Search engines frequently modify their algorithms and ranking criteria to prevent their natural listings from being manipulated which could impair the Groups Search Engine Optimisation SEO activities.
If the Group is unable to recognise and adapt quickly to such modifications in search engine algorithms the Group could suffer a significant decrease in traffic and revenue.
The Group will continue to operate SEO activities that adhere to search engine guidelines.
DATA SECURITY AND IT RELIABILITY The Group relies heavily on its IT infrastructure and ecommerce system and in particular its websites.
If any one or more of its websites were to fail or be damaged this could impact the Groups ability to trade.
If the Groups IT and data security systems do not function properly there could be website slowdown or unavailability loss of data a failure by the Group to protect the confidential information of its customers from security breaches delays in transaction processing and the inability to accept and fulfil customer orders which could affect the Groups business.
The Group seeks to mitigate this risk by investing significant sums in IT infrastructure including robust backup systems and in March 2017 moved the platform into the cloud.
The Group has a disaster recovery plan in place which has been designed to minimise the impact of data loss or corruption from hardware failure human error hacking or malware.
Brand and proposition
RECOGNITION
Developing and maintaining the reputation of and value associated with the Groups brands is of central importance to the success of the Group.
Brand identity is a critical factor in retaining existing and attracting new customers.
The Group is reliant on its natural search result rankings and paid advertising as it seeks to build market share and attract new customers.
Any failure by the Group to offer highquality products across a range of instruments manufacturers and price points excellent customer service and efficient and reliable delivery could damage its reputation and brands and could result in the loss of customer confidence and a reduction in purchases.
Unfavourable publicity concerning the Group could also damage the Groups brands and its business.
If the Group fails to maintain its brands or if excessive expenses are incurred in this effort the Groups business may be affected.
Rigorous monitoring of customer feedback helps ensure issues are identified and rectified on a timely basis.
Ownbrand products are carefully selected and rigorously tested prior to initial order.
Head of Marketing has been appointed to oversee and better coordinate all marketing activities.
COMPETITION IN ITS TARGET MARKETS The UK and European retail market for musical instruments and music equipment is competitive.
A number of competitors may have financial resources greater than those of the Group.
Both Amazon and eBay sell musical instruments and music equipment.
The Group has a track record of successfully competing on a wide range of factors including quality and range of products price product availability product information convenience delivery options and service.

Risk Description Mitigation SUPPLY AND SALE OF
BRANDED PRODUCTS The Group purchases products from a number of large global musical instrument and music equipment brand owners and the Groups business depends on its ability to source a range of products from wellrecognised brands on commercially reasonable terms.
The relationships between the Group and the thirdparty brand owners are generally based on annual contracts that the Group seeks to renew each year.
The thirdparty brand owners may cease selling products to the Group on terms acceptable to it fail to deliver sufficient quantities of products in a timely manner terminate their relationship with the Group and enter into agreements with the Groups competitors or experience raw material or labour shortages or increases in raw material or labour costs.
Any disruption to the availability or supply of products to the Group or any deterioration to the terms on which products are supplied to the Group could affect its business.
Whilst sales of thirdparty branded products accounted for approximately 70% of the Groups turnover in FY17 FY16 71% the Directors do not consider that the Group is significantly reliant on any one or more major brandbrand owner.
The Directors believe that the relative size of the Group its purchase volumes and the strength of its relationship with the brand owners built over a prolonged period in many cases make it unlikely that any such arrangements would be terminated.
RELIANCE ON
MANUFACTURERS
The Group subcontracts manufacture of its ownbrand musical instruments and equipment to independent thirdparty businesses in SouthEast Asia.
Any disruption to supply or issues such as poor product quality could have an adverse impact on the Groups reputation.
The impact of any issues arising with subcontractors products is exacerbated by the lead times involved 1214 weeks.
The Group has been successfully importing for over 14 years and has relationships with over 30 manufacturers providing resourcing options.
The Board believes that the Group has established robust takeon and ongoing monitoring procedures covering areas such as quality control and delivery performance for new and existing subcontract manufacturers that the Group seeks to adhere to rigidly.
DEPENDENCE ON KEY PERSONNEL The loss of any key individual or the inability to attract appropriate personnel could impact upon the Groups future performance.
Should the Group fail to retain or attract suitably qualified and experienced personnel it may not be able to compete successfully.
The Board has recruited into key management positions and on 1 March 2017 appointed three further Directors to Gear4music Limited and formed an Operational Board.
The senior management team is compensated through a combination of marketrate salary and longerterm sharebased incentives to align key peoples remuneration with the continued success of the Group.

Gear4music Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 NOTES FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 28 FEBRUARY 2017 General information Gear4music Holdings plc is a public limited company is incorporated and domiciled in the UK and is listed on the Alternative Investment Market AIM of the London Stock Exchange.
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries collectively referred to as the Group.
The Parent Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
The principal activity of the Group is the retail of musical instruments and equipment.
The registered office of Gear4music Holdings plc Company number  Gear4music Limited Company number and Cagney Limited dormant subsidiary Company number  is Kettlestring Lane Clifton Moor York YO30 4XF.

On 10 October 2016 the Group set up a Norwegian subsidiary Gear4music Norway AS as a 100% subsidiary of Gear4music

1 Accounting policies 1.1 Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the AIM rules for Companies and apply the recognition measurement and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRSs and make amendments where necessary in order to comply with Companies Act 2006.
The Company has elected to prepare its Parent Company financial statements in accordance with FRS 102 these are presented on pages 68 to 75.
The Groups accounting policies are set out below and have unless otherwise stated been applied consistently in the consolidated financial statements.
Subjective judgements made by the Directors in the application of these accounting policies that have significant effect on the financial statements are considered in Note 22.
Selected explanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the changes in financial position and performance of the Group since the last annual consolidated financial statements as presented in the Admission document which is available on the Groups investor website.
Accounting period The financial statements presented cover the years ended 28 February 2017 and 29 February 2016.
Measurement convention The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis.
1.2 Adoption of new and revised standards The following Adopted IFRSs have been issued but have not been applied by the Group in these financial statements.
Their adoption is not expected to have a material effect on these financial statements unless otherwise indicated IFRS 9 Financial Instruments effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
Given the nature of the Groups business and its debt structure it is not expected to have a material effect on these financial statements IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 is not expected to have a significant impact on the Groups revenues as the majority of the Groups revenue is for product sales made direct to customers at standard prices and estimates are already made of anticipated returns IFRS 16 Leases effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
This fundamentally changes the accounting for leases by lessees.
It eliminates the current IAS 17 dual accounting model which distinguishes between onbalance sheet finance leases and offbalance sheet operating leases and instead introduces a single onbalance sheet accounting model that is similar to current finance lease accounting.
Operating leases disclosed in Note 20 are expected to come on balance sheet once this standard is adopted Amendments to IAS 12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses effective date to be confirmed Amendments to IAS 7 Disclosure Initiative effective date to be confirmed Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Sharebased Payment Transactions effective date to be confirmed and Amendments to IFRS 4 Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts effective date to be confirmed.

1.3 Going concern The Groups business activities and position in the market are described in the Strategic Report.
The Directors believe that given the Group has significant financial resources and has demonstrated good growth in revenue and underlying profitability from operating activities the Group is well placed to manage its business risks.
The Groups policy is to ensure that it has sufficient facilities to cover its future funding requirements.
Shortterm flexibility is available through trade finance and overdraft facilities.
At 28 February 2017 the Group had 3.0m of cash and bank balances and HSBC have indicated they are supportive of renewing the Groups facilities in July 2017.
The Group is committed to completing a 5.325m property and has approved debtfunding in place and will continue to invest in European distribution centres.
Having duly considered all of these factors and having reviewed the forecasts for the coming year including the investments outlined in the CEOs statement the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue trading for the foreseeable future and as such continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
1.4 Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
In assessing control the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that are currently exercisable.
The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation IntraGroup balances and transactions and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intraGroup transactions are eliminated.
1.5 Foreign currency International transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in the respective foreign currencies and translated into the functional currency of the Group Sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Translational accounting gains and losses are recognised in the income statement in the period they arise.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Nonmonetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation are translated to the Groups functional currency Sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the year where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Exchange differences arising from this translation of foreign operations are reported as an item of other comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reserve.
Functional currency The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling which is the Groups functional currency.
1.6 Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group Following the adoption of IAS 32 financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions a they include no contractual obligations upon the Company or Group as the case may be to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Company or Group and b where the instrument will or may be settled in the Companys own equity instruments it is either a nonderivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Companys own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability.
Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Companys own shares the amounts presented in this financial information for called up share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.

Lease payments are accounted for as described below in Note 1.16.
1.9 Business combinations All business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
The Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as the fair value of the consideration transferred plus the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree less the net recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
Costs related to the acquisition are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
Goodwill impairment testing Goodwill is not amortised but tested annually for impairment.
For the purpose of impairment testing the goodwill is allocated to cashgenerating units or CGUs.
Subject to an operating segment ceiling test for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment is tested reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes.

1.10 Intangible assets Software platform Computer software development costs that generate economic benefits beyond one year and meet the development asset recognition criteria as laid out in IAS 38 Intangible Assets are capitalised as Intangible assets.
These costs include the payroll costs of employees directly associated with the development and other direct external material and service costs.
Costs are capitalised only where there is an identifiable development that will bring future economic benefit.
All other website and maintenance costs are expenses in the statement of comprehensive income.
Capitalised software development costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives and charged to administrative expenses in the statement of comprehensive income.
Other intangible assets Expenditure on internallygenerated goodwill and brands is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and less accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets from the date they are available for use.
The estimated useful lives are as follows Brand 10 years and Software platform 38 years 1.11 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value NRV.
Cost is based on the firstin firstout principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and other costs in bringing them to their existing location and condition.
Stock is neither fashionable nor perishable.
A provision is made in respect of inventories as follows 100% against returns stock found to be faulty that is retained to be used for spare parts on the basis there is no direct NRV value and a provision for the expected product loss on dealing with returns stock.
1.12 Impairment excluding inventories and deferred tax assets Financial assets including receivables A financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective evidence that it is impaired.
A financial asset is impaired if objective evidence indicates that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset and that the loss event had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
The effect of discounting is not material.
When a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease the decrease in impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.
Nonfinancial assets The carrying amounts of the Groups nonfinancial assets other than inventories and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists then the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
For Goodwill the recoverable amount is estimated each year at the same time.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell.
In assessing value in use the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For the purpose of impairment testing assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets the CGU.
The goodwill acquired in a business combination for the purpose of impairment testing is allocated to CGUs.
Subject to an operating segment ceiling test for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment is tested reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
An impairment loss would be recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.
No impairments have been recognised in the periods presented.

Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.
Sharebased payments The Group operates share option plans for qualifying employees of the Group.
The fair value of these shares is determined using the BlackScholes option pricing model and is expensed in the statement of comprehensive income as an employee expense on a straightline basis over the vesting period after allowing for an estimate of the number of shares that are expected to vest with a corresponding increase in equity.
The level of vesting is reviewed annually and the expense adjusted to reflect any changes in estimates.
1.14 Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event that can be reliably measured and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pretax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability.
1.15 Revenue Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer usually on dispatch of the goods.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received including freight charges and duty where applicable excluding discounts rebates VAT and other sales taxes or duty.
Carriage income is recognised on recognition of the related product sales.
Returns are dealt with on receipt of the product into the warehouse which triggers an automatic credit and an estimate for returns is provided for at the year end.
The Group offers retail point of sale credit on orders over 250 through an agreement with an external credit provider.
The Group does not retain any credit risk and commissions are recognised within revenue on recognition of the credit sale.
In the year ended 28 February 2017 this income totalled 102000 2016 37900.
No discount is offered on any sales made through this credit provider.
1.16 Expenses Operating lease payments Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straightline basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Finance lease payments Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability.
The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Exceptional items Items which are significant by virtue of their size or nature and which are considered to be nonrecurring are classified as exceptional operating items.
Such items which include for instance fees in relation to IPO are included within the appropriate consolidated income statement category but are highlighted separately in the Notes to the financial information.
Exceptional operating items are excluded from the profit measures used by the Board to monitor and measure the underlying performance of the Group.
Government and other forms of grant Government and other grants from third parties are recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attached conditions will be complied with.
When the grant relates to an expense item it is recognised as a reduction in the costs incurred on a systematic basis over the periods that the costs for which it is intended to compensate are expensed.
Where the grant relates to an asset it is recognised on a systematic basis over the UEL of the related asset.
Financing income and expenses Financing expenses comprise interest payable and finance leases recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method unwinding of the discount on provisions and net foreign exchange losses that are recognised in the income statement see foreign currency accounting policy.
Financing income comprises interest receivable on funds invested and net foreign exchange gains.
Interest income and interest payable is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues using the effective interest method.

1.17 Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
A temporary difference on the initial recognition of goodwill is not provided for.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
1.18 Segmental reporting An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Groups other components.
The Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM has been identified as the Board of Directors.
2 Segmental reporting The Groups revenue and profit was derived from its principal activity which is the sale of musical instruments and equipment.
In accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments the Group has made the following considerations to arrive at the disclosure made in these financial statements.
IFRS 8 requires consideration of the CODM within the Group.
Operating segments have been identified based on the internal reporting information and management structures with the Group.
Based on this information it has been noted that the CODM reviews the business as one segment and receives internal information on this basis.
Therefore it has been concluded that there is only one reportable segment.

Impairment testing In accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets the Group reviews the carrying value of its intangible assets.
A detailed review was undertaken at 28 February 2017 to assess whether the carrying value of assets was supported by the net present value in use calculations based on cashflow projections from formally approved budgets and longerterm forecasts.
Intangible assets comprise goodwill the Gear4music brand name and the proprietary software platform.
A CGU is defined as the smallest group of assets that generate cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups thereof.
The Group is deemed to have a single CGU to which the goodwill the software platform and the brand are allocated.
An impairment review has been performed on this CGU.
The recoverable amount of this CGU has been determined based on valueinuse calculations.
In assessing value in use a fiveyear forecast to 28 February 2022 was used to provide cash flow projections that have been discounted at a pretax discount rate of 10%.
The cash flow projections are subject to key assumptions in respect of revenue growth gross margin performance overhead expenditure and capital expenditure.
Management has reviewed and approved the assumptions inherent in the model Revenue forecasts based on growth by geographical market at a range of growth levels based on market size and estimate of opportunity trends specific projects underway and managements experience and expectation Product costs are assumed to be broadly flat and gross margins are forecast to be retained at current levels over the fiveyear management forecast period and Wage increases are a function of recruitment and a personbyperson review of current staff with a range of percentage increases.
No impairment loss was identified in the current year 2016 nil.
The valuations indicate significant headroom and therefore a terminal growth rate assumption has not been needed to be applied in order to support the valuation of this CGU.
Any reasonably possible change in other key assumptions including the discount rate would not result in an impairment of the related goodwill or other intangible assets.

17 Financial instruments Financial risk management The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks market risk including foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups policies on the management of liquidity credit interest rate and foreign currency risks are set out below.
The main purpose of the Groups financial instruments which comprise term loans hire purchase finance leases cash and liquid resources and various items arising directly from its operations such as trade receivables and trade payables is to finance the Groups operations.
Risk management framework Regular reviews of strategic risks are performed by the Board.

General commercial risk is considered at an annual insurance review in conjunction with an independent broker and the appropriate insurance policies put in place.
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups policy is to ensure that it has sufficient and appropriately structured facilities to cover its future funding requirements.
Shortterm flexibility is available through import loans and overdraft facilities and at certain times of the year the netting off of surplus funds.
The carrying amounts are the amounts due if settled at the period end date.
The contractual undiscounted cash flows include estimated interest payments over the life of these facilities.

There are a small number of education accounts with schools and colleges that have 30day terms 1.9% of 2017 revenue 2.3% of 2016 revenue and trade accounts 1.2% of 2017 revenue 0.9% of 2016 revenue.
Funds lodged with Amazon Digital River Klarna and V12 Retail Finance totalling 394000 on 28 February 2017 29 February 2016 175000 is included in trade debtors.
Credit risk in relation to cash held with financial institutions is considered low risk given the credit rating of these organisations.
The Groups bank borrowings incur interest at variables rates of between 2.45% and 3.25% above base which exposes the Group to interest rate risk.
Loans are with UKbased institutions denominated in Sterling and linked to the UK base rate.
At 28 February 2017 the Group had cash reserves of 3.0m and could utilise these funds to settle debts and mitigate any associated interest risk.
The Groups policy with regard to interest rate risk is to monitor actual and anticipated changes in base rates and if deemed appropriate seek out alternative financing proposals to ensure retaining a competitive rate.

This analysis assumes that all other variables in particular foreign currency rates remains constant and considers the effect of financial instruments with variable interest rates.

The Group sells into Europe and more recently the rest of the world in eight currencies including Sterling and Euros.
In the year ended 28 February 2017 37% 2016 26% of total revenue were in nonSterling currencies of which 51% 2016 60% were in Euros.
Where costs including local tax liabilities are incurred in these respective currencies currency balances are retained and payments made in these currencies thereby mitigating any associated currency loss.
The opening of distribution centres in Sweden and Germany has increased the proportion of liabilities denominated in Swedish Krona and Euros further extending the natural hedge.
Surplus foreign currency holdings are reviewed on a daily basis and balances in excess of known liabilities are converted into Sterling restricting the period between the transaction and the point of conversion thereby reducing the transactional risk.
The Group purchases ownbranded instruments and equipment from the Far East transacting in US Dollars.
The lead time from committed order to receipt of stock is typically 1214 weeks during which time the Group bears currency risk.
The Group also trades with one supplier 2016 one supplier on a trade credit basis with terms of 60 days.
The Group has the trading platform ability and sufficient price flexibility to be able to pass on some adverse currency variances should it choose and the Group generates enhanced margins on these products such that a proportion of these losses could be absorbed.
The Group does not currently enter into forward contracts but reviews the situation and would consider committing to such a position should it make commercial sense to do so.
The weakening of Sterling following the UKs EU Referendum vote was of benefit to the Group as a net exporter.
It increased ownbranded product intake costs and the business sought to manage this by renegotiating orders and investing in larger volumes to leverage purchasing economies of scale.

Trade and other payables and receivables The fair values of these items are considered to be their carrying value as the impact of discounting future cash flows has been assessed as not material.
Cash and cash equivalents The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is estimated as its carrying amount where the cash is repayable on demand.
The fair value of shortterm deposits is considered to be the carrying value as the balances are held in floating rate accounts where the interest rate is reset to market rates.
Longterm and shortterm borrowings The fair value of bank loans is recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition interestbearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The fair value of the loan notes is calculated based on the expected future principal and interest cash flows discounted at the market rate of interest at the balance sheet date.
Derivative financial instruments The Group does not routinely enter into forward exchange contracts.
The fair value of any material forward exchange contracts held would be calculated by management based on external valuations received from the Groups bankers.
Contingent consideration The contingent consideration is assumed to be 100% payable.
The consideration has been discounted to present value at 2.7% being equivalent to the prevailing market rate of interest for a similar financial instrument.
Fair value hierarchy The table below analyses financial instruments measured at fair value into a fair value hierarchy based on the valuation techniques used to determine fair value.
Level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 inputs other than quoted priced included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly i. as prices or indirectly i. derived from prices.
Level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.

The preparation of consolidated financial information in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make judgements estimates and assumptions concerning the future that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets liabilities income and expenses.
These judgements are based on historical experience and managements best knowledge at the time and the actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
The estimates and assumptions that have significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities are discussed below The basis for stock provision and by association the carrying value  given the nature of the products sold product margins earned and trading terms with suppliers Management currently provide for faulty returns retained for spare parts and an estimate of the product loss to deal with problem stock.
At 28 February 2017 the provision is 69519 2016 15023 on gross stock of 11.76m 2016 6.92m.
There are no other provisions made.
An accrual for sales returns in the 30day money back guarantee period is made based on historical returns and actual returns could vary from this estimate.
Assumptions inherent in the goodwill impairment review  such calculations require judgement relating to the appropriate discount factors and the short medium and longterm growth prospects.
The impairment test carried out is based on fiveyear approved management forecast and a 10% discount rate see Note 9.
Direct software development costs are capitalised as intangible assets.
Judgement is applied in assessing the flow of future economic benefit and in identifying which costs are capitalised and which are written off as an expense.
Alternative judgement could result in certain costs being expensed.
The UEL of tangible and intangible fixed assets  management selected depreciation and amortisation periods appropriate to the assets held and consistent with industry and accounting norm.
Amortisation periods were independently reviewed as part of an intangible asset valuation exercise on IPO.
Different UELs could be applied that would change the profit and loss charge and balance sheet carrying value.

The amendments to FRS 102 issued in July 2015 and effective immediately have been applied.

All amounts in the financial statements have been rounded to the nearest 1000.
Under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
In these financial statements the Company is considered to be a qualifying entity for the purposes of this FRS and has applied the exemptions available under FRS 102 in respect of the following disclosures Reconciliation of the number of shares outstanding from the beginning to end of the period Cash flow statement and related notes and Key management personnel compensation.

The Company proposed to continue to adopt the reduced disclosure framework FRS102 in future periods.
Accounting period The financial statements presented cover the years ended 28 February 2017 and 29 February 2016.
Measurement convention The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis.
Functional currency The financial statements are presented in Sterling which is the Companys functional currency.
1.2 Going concern These financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis as explained on page 45.
1.3 Investment in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
1.4 Classification of financial instruments issued by the Company In accordance with FRS 102.22 financial instruments issued by the Company are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions a they include no contractual obligations upon the Company to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Company and b where the instrument will or may be settled in the Companys own equity instruments it is either a nonderivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Companys own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability.
Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Companys own shares the amounts presented in this financial information for calledup share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
1.5 Basic financial instruments Basic financial instruments comprise investments other receivables cash and cash equivalents loans and borrowings and trade and other payables.
Trade and other debtors Other receivables are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any impairment losses.

Trade and other creditors Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Interestbearing borrowings Interestbearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributed transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition interestbearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
1.6 Impairment Financial assets including debtors A financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective evidence that it is impaired.
A financial asset is impaired if objective evidence indicates that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset and that the loss event had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
The effect of discounting is not material.
When a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease the decrease in impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.
Nonfinancial assets The carrying amounts of the Companys nonfinancial assets other than inventories and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists then the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cashgenerating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell.
In assessing value in use the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For the purpose of impairment testing assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets the CGU.
An impairment loss would be recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.
No impairments have been recognised in the periods presented.
1.7 Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event that can be reliably measured and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pretax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability.
1.8 Employee benefits Defined contribution plans A defined contribution pension plan is a postemployment benefit plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.
Sharebased payments The Company operates sharebased option plans on behalf of the Group and measures and recognises its sharebased payment expense and recharges it to other Group companies.
1.9 Financial income and expenses Financing expenses comprise interest payable and finance leases recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method unwinding of the discount on provisions and net foreign exchange losses that are recognised in the income statement see foreign currency accounting policy.
Financing income comprises interest receivable on funds invested and net foreign exchange gains.
Interest income and interest payable is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues using the effective interest method.
Dividend income is recognised in profit and loss on the date the Companys right to receive payment is established.

Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
