Chairmans Statement
Eugene Shvidler Unlocking the Value of a World Class Resource Base Dear Shareholder It gives me much pleasure to report that Highland Gold Minings 15th year as a public company  Anniversary 23rd May 2017  marked a period of steady progress on all our strategic fronts.
Before I chronicle such progress I would like to draw your attention to the fact that after 15 years as a publicly quoted enterprise some 63% of your Companys shares are in free float and our shareholder base includes a wide range of UK European and US institutional investors.
Our commitment to good corporate governance remains strong.
Furthermore we continue to enjoy a strong dividend record and a conservative debt profile.
As some of you will be aware our recent presentations to the investment and mining communities have focused on unlocking the value of our assets.
I utilise this phrase again because there can be few better descriptions of managements primary objective which was furthered throughout the year under review by effective business strategies and carefully monitored disciplines.
Unlocking value came of age during 2017 when the results of extensive exploration activity and a series of updated estimates from our producing mines Blagodatnoye and Kekura our flagship development project culminated in a 56% increase in the Companys proven and probable ore reserves from 3.26 Moz of gold and gold equivalent to 5.10 Moz on a yearon year basis.
This significant enhancement of our reserves accompanied by a lowering of average grade from 80 gt to 3.3 gt reflecting lower cutoff grades and increased ore tonnage underlines the strength of our asset base as does a 6.6% increase in our mineral resources
2016.
Further details regarding the extension of our resources and reserves are to be found in the Chief Executives Report and the subsequent Operational
Our business strategy as outlined in recent years is to balance a steady rate of production from our operating mines MNV Novo and Belaya Gora  with the progression of our key development and exploration projects while also reviewing opportunities to add new resources or production in our regions of presence.
In keeping with this approach total production registered a 4.3% increase to a record 272274 oz of gold and gold equivalent in 2017 compared with the previous years 261159 oz.
This performance exceeded our initial 255000  265000 oz guidance range and our estimate in respect of 2018 targets looks for a maintained outcome of between 265000 and 275000 oz.
Consistent with our business strategy your Company will continue to maximise the upside potential of our operating assets namely MNV Lifeofmine extended Novo capacity being expanded to 1.3 Mtpa and Belaya Gora processing plant upgrades and combination with the Blagodatnoye deposit.
We will also drive the development of assets at the Definitive Feasibility Study andor Preliminary Feasibility Study stages encompassing Kekura where Government approval has been received for the development of a deposit of federal significance and infrastructure construction has commenced and Klen where we are planning additional exploration work.
I would like to emphasise the importance we place on retaining our low cost producer credentials and I am pleased to report that our current ratios fully support our status as one of the most competitive gold mining companies in the world.
Total
Cash Costs amounted to US507 per oz in 2017 while our AllInSustaining Cash Costs totalled US664 per oz.
This compares with US454 per oz and US652 per oz respectively in 2016.
The average realised price of gold and gold equivalent during 2017 amounted to US1162 per oz compared with US1136 per oz in 2016 and should be seen against our AllInSustaining Cash Costs measurement.
The average realised price of gold in respect of MNV and Belaya Gora was US1259 per oz during the year.
Highland Gold Mining Limited  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT The combination of a stronger Russian rouble and the resulting slightly higher dollar production costs as well as our utilisation of low grade ore at Belaya Gora was reflected in a 4.4% reduction in EBITDA to US155.3 million in 2017 compared with US162.5 million in 2016.
In line with this our EBITDA margin declined to 49.0% 2016 53.1%.
Net debt as at 31 December 2017 amounted to US198 million versus US205 million as at 31 December 2016.
Our net debt to EBITDA ratio remains stable at 1.28 2016 1.26.
Your Directors recognise the Companys commitment to the return of profits to shareholders through dividend payments and towards the end of last year we decided to clarify such intentions by way of adopting a more formalised dividend policy.
The key aspects of the policy are as follows The Company aims to pay a dividend that takes into account its cash generation profitability balance sheet strength and capital investment requirements The Company anticipates that the total dividend distribution for each financial year will be 20% of net cash flow from operating activities and The Board may recommend the distribution of additional cash on the balance sheet through increased or special dividends should such funds not be required for capital expenditure or debt repayment.
In the wake of such considerations the Board is pleased to recommend the payment of a second interim dividend of 0.0542 per share 2016 final dividend 0.054 per share which will make a total distribution of 0.104 per share 2016 0.104 per share for the financial year to 31 December 2017.
As evidenced above and in the ensuing sections 2017 has witnessed sound progress on numerous fronts.
Your Board has every confidence that such progress will serve to deliver further returns to shareholders in the future.
It is with deep regret that I have to report the occurrence of a fatality at our Novo underground mine on 13 April 2017 as well as a lamentable increase in Lost Time Incidents Frequency Rate LTIFR to 4.88 in 2017 compared to 2.30 in 2016.
A thorough review of the circumstances surrounding the fatality has been carried out as well as a comprehensive review of our health and safety system implemented by a new highlyqualified HSE team.
Among the results of this effort is a new set of cardinal rules of safety behaviour at each of our production sites more details on this programme in the Operational Review.
I would now like to take this opportunity on behalf of the Board to thank all of our employees for the hard work and commitment that was integral to all that has been achieved in our Anniversary Year.
Eugene Shvidler Executive Chairman Highland Gold Mining Limited  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report CEOs Report Denis Alexandrov It is gratifying to report that the extensive exploration and development activity undertaken by Highland Gold during 2016 and 2017 has been rewarded with a material 56% increase in your Companys ore reserves proven and probable to 5.1 Moz of gold and gold equivalent as at 31 December 2017 compared with 3.3 Moz at yearend 2016.
This JORCcompliant reserve estimation as at 31 December 2017 was accompanied by notification of a similarly compliant 6.6% increase in the Companys mineral resources measured indicated and inferred from 16.1 Moz of gold and gold equivalent to 17.2 Moz on a yearonyear basis.
At the same time the average grade of ore reserves was lowered from 8.0 gt at yearend 2016 to 3.3 gt at yearend 2017 due to lower cutoff grades and increased ore tonnage at our Novo and Belaya Gora operations and the inclusion of the Blagodatnoye deposit.
Last year I emphasised the importance we attached to our Khabarovsk Baikal and Chukotka cluster initiative in order to drive overall development by focusing our activities in key geographic regions and maximising synergies.
The potential benefits of this approach are well illustrated by recent developments at Belaya Gora Khabarovsk cluster where our Preliminary Feasibility Study PFS largely compiled in 2017 and published post the financial yearend envisages an integrated Belaya Gora Blagodatnoye operation with combined gold reserves of 932000 oz more than triple Belaya Goras 291000 oz recorded at the outset of 2017.
Grade was reduced to 1.44 gt versus 3.3 gt for Belaya Gora alone.
Average annual gold production is estimated at 55000 oz with the life of the combined mine forecast to extend of US802.
Operations at Belaya Gora in advance of the PFS focused on the processing of low grade stockpiles following a regulatory decision to reduce the mines cutoff grade from 0.7 gt to 0.3 gt.
Overall output recorded a relatively modest yearonyear decline from 45000 oz to 43000 oz.
An updated JORC reserve statement in respect of MNV our longstanding mine which is also located in the Khabarovsk region was completed and published in May 2017.
This confirmed a doubling of ore reserves to 500000 oz Au as of 31 December 2016 which in turn underwrote a lifeofmine extension to at least 2022.
We are intent on extending MNVs productive life beyond this date and to this end we have budgeted for an annual US3 million  US5 million exploration spend.
Nearmine exploration activity is ongoing and initial exploratory work has commenced in relation to our two new greenfield site licences  Zamanchivaya 4.2 sq km and Kulibinskaya 38 sq km which are directly adjacent to MNV.
A solid performance from MNV throughout 2017 resulted in a 6.6% increase in gold and gold equivalent production to 102000 oz.
Novo fully maintained its status as our lowest cost highest margin producer by way of a 7.7% increase in the production of gold and gold equivalent to 126000 oz in 2017 compared with 117000 oz in 2016.
A JORC reserve audit completed at Novo in November 2017 brought a 430% increase in ore tonnage.
Ore reserves rose from the previously estimated 1.1 Moz of gold equivalent to 1.9 Moz as of 31 December 2016 at an average grade of 3.3 gt compared with the previously reported 9.8 gt.
The planned expansion of Novos mining and milling capacity to 1.3 Mtpa is designed to compensate for the lower grades and the first stage of the development involving a series of upgrades to the mining system is scheduled for completion by yearend 2018.
Highland Gold Mining Limited  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT The second stage focused on the processing plant is in the design phase.
We continued to pursue our strategy of balancing a stable rate of production with the progression of our development and exploration projects with the cash flow from the former integral to the funding of the latter.
Output recorded a 4.3% increase to a record 272274 oz of gold and gold equivalent and our guideline for the current financial year is a comparable outcome of between 265000  275000 oz.
Our principal development project is Kekura a world class deposit located in the remote Chukotka region in the Far East of Russia.
Government approval for the development of a deposit of federal significance a standard regulatory requirement for an operation of this scale was duly received in 2017.
Exploration activity included 11000 metres of reverse circulation drilling and 4750 metres of core drilling for the purpose of reserve confirmation while work commenced on a statefunded power line to connect Kekura to the regional electrical grid.
The Definitive Feasibility Study for Kekura was completed in early 2018 and anticipates An estimated start date of 2021 Sequential and combined openpit and underground extraction with a total mine life of 16 years twice the original expectation Processing plant capacity of 800000 tpa with an 85% recovery rate Capex of US229 million pre commissioningexcluding underground operations Average annual gold production of 172000 oz for the first eight years and 46000 oz thereafter and Average Total Cash Costs of US511 per oz and AllIn Sustaining Cash Costs of US541 per oz.
Kekuras Au resources measured indicated and inferred are currently estimated at 2.46 Moz commanding an average grade of 8.1 gt while Au reserves proven and probable total 2.00 Moz with an average grade of 7.0 gt.
Preliminary construction is underway with the bulk of such work scheduled to take place in 2019  2020.
Additional RandD studies at Klen involving external consultants indicated the potential for higher than anticipated recoveries of more than 90% and lower than forecast operating costs.
Such findings will be incorporated in the updated PFS which is expected to be completed in the near future.
Meanwhile additional exploration is to be undertaken in order to delineate any additional potential resources.
In Kyrgyzstan our fourth region the Scoping Study for Unkurtash published in Q1 2017 envisaged Two open pits and an 18year LoM Processing plant throughput of 4 Mtpa with an 80% plus recovery rate Annual production of 133000 oz of gold at an average operating cost of US616 per oz and A Capex requirement of US322 million to commence production.
Your Board continues to consider prospective partnerships to develop the Unkurtash resource and preliminary talks have been held with certain parties.
In conclusion I have every confidence that the quality of assets outlined above and the strategies that management is deploying to capitalise on such assets augur well for the Companys medium term growth prospects.
You can find more details in the Operational Review which includes a detailed analysis of 2017s activities including those associated with the health and safety of employees and the protection of the environment.

Strategic Report CEOs Report continued Highland Gold Mining Limited  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT OPERATIONAL REVIEW KHABAROVSK REGION RUSSIA Mnogovershinnoye MNV Production of gold and gold equivalent at MNV achieved a 6.6% increase from 96188 oz to 102502 oz in 2017 thereby accounting for a fully maintained 38% share of total production.
The average grade registered an 8% improvement from 2.36 gt to 2.55 gt yearonyear reflecting a higher proportion of underground ore while the recovery rate was effectively unchanged at 91.4% 2016 91.5%.
Completion and publication of an updated JORC reserve statement in May revealed a doubling of MNVs ore reserves to 500000 oz Au a development that saw the lifeofmine LoM extended by four years to at least 2022.
Management is intent on continuing operations beyond this date and a nearmine exploration programme actively progressed in 2016 and 2017 is ongoing.
The Company aims to continue budgeting US3  5 million per year to support this effort.
May also witnessed the receipt of licences in respect of two greenfield sites adjacent to MNV namely Zamanchivaya 4.2 sq km located to the north east of the mine and Kulibinskaya 38 sq km located to the south west of the mine.
The reevaluation of MNVs historic waste dumps continued throughout 2017 an exercise that has added a total of 1.07 million tonnes of ore with grades of approximately 1.1 gt Au since the programme commenced in 2016.
PRODUCTION COSTS Total cash costs amounted to US617 per oz 2016 US607 per oz while allin sustaining costs were US741 per oz 2016 US765 per oz.
CAPITAL COSTS A total of US12.8 million was invested at MNV in 2017.
This included capitalised expenditures and construction US5.5 million purchase of equipment US6.6 million and exploration US0.7 million.
OUTLOOK
The extensive nearmine exploration activity seen during 2017 will continue in 2018 with a view to identifying sufficient resources to facilitate a further extension of LoM.
Such activity will prioritise areas in the vicinity of previously mined ore bodies including the Intermediate and Deep ore bodies and the Burlivy zone while also encompassing the new greenfield sites  Zamanchivaya and Kulibinskaya  where geochemical prospecting work was carried out in 2017 in preparation for 2018s exploration programme.
Appraisal of the waste stockpiles  a potentially significant source of additional resource  will also continue in 2018.
Against this background an updated JORCcompliant reserve estimate is scheduled for completion in Q3 2018.
Belaya Gora Operations at Belaya Gora focused on processing lowgrade ore stockpiles during 2017 in advance of the PreFeasibility Study involving a joint mining schedule with the nearby Blagodatnoye deposit.
A lowering of the cutoff grade from 0.7 gt to 0.3 gt was reflected in a yearon year reduction in mined ore grade from 1.23 gt to 0.77 gt.
The recovery rate improved to 72.5% 2016 71.4% and the decline in overall production was limited to 6% at 43166 oz of gold and gold equivalent.
An exploratory drilling programme focused on the deep horizons of the northwestern flank of the Belaya Gora licence area was completed in Q4 2017 an exercise which saw 111 diamond holes totalling 12686 metres drilled over the course of the year.
In addition Stage 1 exploration drilling was completed at the Kolchansky area within the broader Belaya Gora Flanks licence.
The drilling programme as at the yearend encompassed 702 metres over 14 holes and has continued into 2018.
PRODUCTION COSTS Total cash costs amounted to US861 per oz 2016 US678 per oz while allin sustaining costs were US1029 per oz 2016 US1134 per oz.
CAPITAL COSTS A total of US3.8 million was invested at Belaya Gora in 2017.
This included capitalised expenditures and construction US3.4 million and purchase of equipment US0.4 million.
OUTLOOK
The pointers to the future lie in the PreFeasibility Study announced early in 2018.
Features include More than tripled gold reserves of 932000 oz encompassing Blagodatnoye and a 60% increase in Belaya Gora ore versus Belaya Goras previously reported 291000 oz Upgrades to the processing plant including the addition of a carbon inpulp CIP circuit designed to improve recoveries from 72% to 8691% for Belaya Gora ore and 90% for Blagodatnoye ore New openpit mining plans which envisage the processing of Blagodatnoye ore at the Belaya Gora mill and a combined LoM extending to 2032 Capex estimated at US15 million in respect of the plant upgrade and US21 million to transfer mining activity from Belaya Gora to Blagodatnoye in 2023 and Estimated annual production of 55000 oz Au over LoM at an average Total Cash Cost of US802 per oz and AllIn Sustaining costs of US848 per oz.
Blagodatnoye
The year under review witnessed the processing of extensive exploration work carried out in 2016 and the completion of an additional drilling programme totalling 2400 metres.
CAPITAL COSTS A total of US1.1 million was invested at Blagodatnoye in 2017 and represented a capitalised exploration and evaluation asset.
OUTLOOK
The Blagodatnoye deposit is the subject of a prospective amalgamation with Belaya Goras mining and processing operations.
The new mining plan was outlined in Belaya Goras PreFeasibility Study announced early in 2018 and highlighted above.
In the consolidated financial statements capital costs for Blagodatnoye are reported together with MNV.
Highland Gold Mining Limited  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 ZABAIKALSKY REGION RUSSIA Novoshirokinskoye Novo Production of gold and gold equivalent at Novo recorded a 7.7% increase from 2016s 117577 oz to 126606 oz in 2017 representing 46.5% 2016 45% of total output.
Ore mined registered a 12.7% increase to 858106 tonnes on a yearonyear basis while ore processed during 2017 advanced 9% to 825819 tonnes versus 2016.
Average grade was effectively unchanged at 5.61 gt 2016 5.62 gt as was the recovery rate at 85.0% 2016 85.9%.
Completion of an updated JORC reserve audit in November 2017 saw ore reserves advance from the previously estimated 1.1 Moz to 1.9 Moz Au Eq.
2016 with an average grade of 3.3 gt compared with the previously reported 9.8 gt and the aforementioned 5.61 gt in respect of 2017.
The lower grade reflects a reduction in the cutoff grade and a substantial increase in ore volume.
Work continued on the expansion of Novos ore mining and processing capacity from 700000 tpa to 1.3 mtpa.
In line with this a comprehensive survey of the hoist headframe crusher and main fan unit buildings was conducted.
PRODUCTION COSTS Total cash costs amounted to US291 per oz 2016 US254 per oz while allin sustaining costs were US342 per oz 2016 US274 per oz.
CAPITAL COSTS A total of US13.5 million was invested at Novo in 2017.
This included capitalised expenditures and construction US9.7 million and purchase of equipment US3.8 million.
OUTLOOK
The expansion of Novos capacity designed to compensate for the expected lower ore grades  is scheduled for completion in 2020.
Design documentation for the project has been split into two stages Stage 1 which has already been filed with the Russian State Expert Board for approval encompasses construction and installation work including the main fan unit building the skip shaft and dosing complex and runoff water treatment facilities.
Stage 2 encompasses facilities in relation to the processing plant and the tailings dam.
The Company is also reviewing the potential for the utilisation of dense media separation DMS or Xray separation to reduce capital costs associated with Stage 2 mill expansion.
Baley Ore Cluster Taseevskoye Sredny Golgotay and ZIF1 The primary objective at Taseevskoye the largest of the Baley Hub projects is a derisking of the site by way of pumping water out of the Taseevskoye openpit and monitoring any inflow of water from the neighbouring Baley pit in preparation for exploration activity designed to verify reserves.
Some 4.3 million cubic metres of water were pumped from the Taseevskoye pit during H2 2016 and H1 2017 thereby resulting in a 10.05 metre decrease in the water level.
No water inflow was observed from the Baley pit.
Pumping is currently on hold due to the fact that the ZIF2 tailings pond which receives the water is full.
In November Giprotsvetmet the mining and metallurgy research and design institute Moscow issued a tradeoff study of various options available for additional storage andor treatment of water pumped from the pit.
Such options are currently under consideration.
Funding was approved in Q3 2017 for the commencement of design work on a heap leach operation at the ZIF1 Tailings licence containing approximately 300000 oz Au.
A technological flowsheet drafted by engineering consultants Irgiredmet anticipates annual throughput of up to 840000 tonnes of ore.
The Company has selected Geotechproekt LLC Ekaterinburg as contractor responsible for all design work associated with the project.
Engineering studies were initiated in October and technical solutions are under development.
CAPITAL COSTS A total of US2.8 million was invested at the Baley area licences in 2017.
CHUKOTKA AUTONOMOUS DISTRICT RUSSIA
Work on the final sections of the Kekura Definitive Feasibility Study DFS including mine design technical solutions a financial model and estimates for capital and operating expenditures was concluded during Q4 2017 prior to publication in early 2018.
This in turn was accompanied by a JORCcompliant resource update which included data drawn from the 201617 drilling programme.
Work was also completed on the design documentation for Kekuras fuel storage facilities in preparation for construction in 2018.
In the wake of an inhouse review an application to the State Expert Board for approval is scheduled for submission in H1 2018.
The government project for construction of the BilibinoKekuraPeschanka Omsukchan power line which will bring the regional electricity grid to Kekura also made headway during Q4 2017.
Meanwhile State Expert Board approval was received for the planned 1106 kV Kekura substation with construction permits duly applied for.
Equipment for the substation was delivered to the Chukotka port of Pevek by Rostek JSC under a supply and installation contract and will be transported to the Kekura site in March 2018 when weather conditions become suitable.
Construction work is scheduled to begin in May 2018.
Klen
Further RandD studies designed to confirm engineering parameters and mitigate project risks for incorporation into the PFS currently under development continued to be carried out by consultants SGS Vostok during Q4 2017.

Management continues to consider partnership opportunities to develop this significant resource and preliminary discussions have been held with potential partners.
HEALTH SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENT The health and safety of our employees is paramount and Highland Golds endeavours to minimise risk and maximise protection are focused on Safe working conditions The management of operational risks Acrosstheboard training and Constant emphasis on the need for employees to develop a sense of accountability for their safety and the safety of others.
To these ends senior staff from the Companys Moscow management office 42 managers Novo 212 managers and MNV 394 managers attended courses entitled Conscious Safety Management during Q4 2017.
Employees at Novo 100 participants and MNV 254 participants also attended a training course on Internal Accident Investigation and eight staff from Moscow participated in a Defensive Driving course.
In 2017 the Health and Safety team developed and introduced several updated corporate standards including Labour Safety Management System Internal Accidents Investigation Behavioural Safety Audits Labour Safety Committee Cardinal Rules of Safe Behaviour and Best Practices.
Tools compliant with these standards were introduced at each of the Companys operating mines.
Audits of occupational safety management systems were conducted at each operating subsidiary in November 2017 the results of which will be used as benchmarks in 2018.
November also saw the Company introduce a new Transportation Safety programme and implement transport audits to facilitate the drafting of improved transportation safety policies.
We are deeply saddened to record that despite our endeavours a fatality occurred at Novos underground mine on 13 April 2017 as reported in the Companys Q1 Report on 27 April 2017.
The Lost Time Incidents Frequency Rate LTIFR totalled 4.88 in respect of 2017 compared with 2.30 in 2016.
The number of incidents across the Group totalled 26 over the course of the year involving the aforementioned fatality and 13 incidents at Novo five such incidents at Belaya Gora and seven at MNV.
This compares with one fatality and 13 incidents in 2016.
The scale of increase is in part due to more stringent reporting requirements in relation to minor incidents.
During the year a total of 1582 employees attended safety induction and fire and electrical safety induction oneday courses while 235 managers and specialists underwent selftraining and testing safety courses utilising OlimpOKS software and were certified on industrial safety 7  30 day programmes.
As in the past auxiliary rescue teams at each of the Companys mines have been kept at the ready to respond to any emergency.
The Company diligently observes environmental and regulatory requirements and actively seeks to identify analyse and mitigate any risks from operations that might impact the environment.
Approximately 1800 employees underwent environmental training programmes during 2017 while 418 employees participated in class IIV hazard waste treatment training with subsequent testing under the OlimpOKS system.
A further 75 managers and specialists attended a twoday course to familiarise themselves with the new ISO 140012015 standard for environmental management systems.
An environmental management system certification audit at the Moscow office and at MNV carried out by risk management specialists DNV confirmed compliance with the requirements of the new ISO 140012015 standard.
The absence of any significant discrepancies points to the efficacy of the environmental management systems in place.
Highland Gold Mining Limited  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report CFOs Report Alla Baranovskaya Highland Gold retained its position among the worlds lowestcost gold producers during the year.
Trading conditions on the global metal market during the year to 31 December 2017 were for the most part favourable.
Despite price fluctuations between US1146 per oz and US1358 per oz over the course of the year the average London Bullion Market Association LBMA gold price was US1257 an increase of 0.5% versus 2016.
The prices of lead and zinc traded at their highest levels for three years.
Meanwhile the strength of the Russian rouble influenced by rising oil prices impacted negatively on financial indicators and exerted upward pressure on costs.
In 2017 Highland Gold increased sales volume retained its status as one of the worlds lowestcost gold producers and maintained a strong cash position.
This enabled the Company to deliver a competitive dividend distribution for the fifth consecutive year.
Total revenue increased by 3.5% to US316.7 million primarily driven by the higher volume of realised gold and gold equivalents.
Revenues from sales of precious metals and concentrates totalled US185.8 million and US130.5 million respectively.
During the reporting period the Company sold 270380 oz of gold and gold equivalent representing a 1.1% volume increase versus 2016.
Novos contribution accounting for 46.0% of the total was effectively unchanged.
A modest decrease of 0.4% in Novo sales was related to the reserving of a consignment of zinc concentrate under a new export agreement.
MNV increased its sales volume by 5.3% to 102015 oz representing a 37.7% share.
Belaya
Gora accounted for a 16.2% share in the wake of a 3.4% decline in sales volume to 43885 oz 2016 45411 oz due to processing lower grade ore from stockpiles.
Low cost high margin During 2017 the Company continued to pursue a no hedge policy.
The
Companys average realised price of gold and gold equivalent increased by 2.3% to US1162 per oz compared with US1136 per oz in 2016.
The average realised price of gold in respect of MNV and Belaya Gora net of commission was US1259 per oz which corresponded with the average market price.
The higher prices for lead and zinc raised the average price of gold equivalent realised by Novo to per eq. per eq. oz in 2016 4.0% yoy.
The Companys cost of sales net of depreciation increased by 12.8% to US139.6 million 2016 US123.8 million.
The negative effect of the strengthening Russian rouble was heightened by an increase in energy prices 6% in RUR yoy and the impact of overall inflation 2.5%.
Depreciation amounted to US49.5 million down 17.8% yoy largely reflecting the lifeofmine extensions at all operational assets.
Managements efforts to maximise operating efficiencies and reduce costs across the board led to a decrease in consumption lower expenses for repairs and reduced maintenance costs for infrastructure and sites.
This in turn enabled the Company to offset rising roubledenominated costs and charges including labour energy and taxes.
The decline in Belaya Goras mining activity and the lowering of the cutoff grade to 0.3 gt in line with the authorities requirement resulted in a significant reduction in change in work in progress.
Stripping volume started to be classified as poor ore and is subject to impairment testing.
Total cash costs TCC increased by 11.7% to US507 per oz comfortably below the industry average.
US291 per eq. of mining from lower horizons.
MNV our oldest mine succeeded in holding total cash costs at US617 per oz 2016 US607 per oz assisted by an increase in sales volume.
Belaya Goras total cash costs advanced from US678 per oz to US861 per oz a reflection of processing lowergrade stockpile ore.
Allin sustaining costs AISC registered only a marginal increase from US652 per oz in 2016 to US664 per oz in 2017.

Total cash costs include mine site operating costs such as mining processing administration royalties and production taxes but are exclusive of depreciation depletion and amortisation capital and exploration costs.
Total cash costs are then divided by ounces sold to arrive at the total cash costs of sales.
This data provides additional information and is a nonGAAP measure.
In line with guidance issued by the World Gold Council the formula used to define the allin sustaining cash costs measurement commences with total cash costs per ounce sold and then adds sustaining capital expenditures corporate general and administrative costs mine site exploration and evaluation costs and environmental rehabilitation costs.
This data seeks to represent the total costs of producing gold from current operations and therefore it does not include capital expenditures attributable to projects or mine expansions exploration and evaluation costs attributable to growth projects income tax payments interest costs or dividend payments.
EBITDA margin is defined as EBITDA divided by total revenue.
Higher administrative expenses reflecting the strength of the rouble were compensated by a 20% reduction in sustaining CAPEX at BG and MNV together with a decrease in BGs poor ore provision.
Higher average realised prices and largely maintained AISC delivered strong headroom of US499 per ounce effectively underwriting the Companys development projects and dividend distribution.
In 2017 the Companys EBITDA decreased by 4.4% to US155.3 million 2016 US162.5 million.
In line with this the EBITDA margin dipped from 53.1% to 49.0% a ratio which underlines Highlands status as one of the worlds most efficient gold producers.
The Companys management analysed internal and external indicators of impairment as of 31 December 2017.
No impairment loss was recognised in 2017.
In 2016 the Company recognised impairment loss in respect of BG amounting to US22.8 million.
Highland Gold Mining Limited  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 In 2017 the Company recognised a net finance cost of US2.5 million compared with US5.0 million in 2016.
The principal components were the interest expense on bank loans in the amount of US0.8 million in 2017 2016 US2.2 million and accretion expense on site restoration provision in the amount of US1.6 million in 2017 2016 US1.7 million.
A foreign exchange gain of US0.7 million 2016 gain of US1.9 million resulted from the settlement of foreign currency transactions and the retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in Russian roubles into US Dollars.
Income tax charges almost doubled to US34.5 million in 2017 compared with US18.3 million in 2016.
The increase resulted from a substantial US14.9 million reduction in released deferred tax largely as a result of future tax revaluation because of the roubles appreciation at the end of the year.
Current tax expenses totalled US33.3 million Novo US19.4 million MNV US13.1 million BG US0.4 million and RDM US0.4 million while dividend withholding tax amounted to US7.7 million.
Net profit benefiting from the growth in revenue cost controls and zero impairment losses rose 37% from 2016s US47.9 million to US65.9 million.
Consequentially earnings per share advanced from US0.145 in 2016 to US0.201 for the year to 31 December 2017.
The Companys cash inflow from operating activities registered a 6.0% decrease to US131.0 million reflecting higher income taxes US2.9 million and lower EBITDA.
Capital expenditure for the reporting period amounted to US58.3 million versus US59.3 million in respect of 2016.
This primarily related to nearmine exploration at MNV designed to further extend the LoM the expansion of Novos processing capacity and the progression of the Kekura project.
Specific capital expenditures included US12.8 million at MNV US13.5 million at Novo US3.8 million at Belaya Gora US22.4 million at Kekura and US5.8 million in relation to other exploration and development projects.
Capital expenditures were entirely funded by operating cash flow.
The Companys total debt is denominated in USD.
The debt in relation to facility agreements with banks showed a decrease of 2.0% to US207.4 million as of 31 December 2017 2016 US211.6 million accompanied by a 24.3% reduction in the effective annual interest rate to 3.4% 2016 4.5% despite rising
To mitigate the latters negative effect on the cost of debt management continued to switch from floating to fixed interest rates thereby increasing the overall proportion of fixedrate liabilities to 65% compared with 47% as of end December 2016.
At the end of the reporting period cash and cash equivalents amounted to US12.4 million compared with US8.7 million as of 31 December 2016.

Alla Baranovskaya Chief Financial Officer The ratio of net debt to EBITDA Cost of debt management Cash position bridge USm Highland Gold Mining Limited  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 The Group is exposed to a number of risks and uncertainties which in most cases are relevant to the entire gold mining industry.
These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from expected or historical results.
The main challenge is to manage them effectively.
The Group recognises that dealing with risks is an integral part of managing its operations and is fundamental to the Groups business success.
The Groups risk management system is designed to provide a consistent and clear framework for managing and reporting the most significant operational risks to the Board of
The Board is responsible for maintaining the Groups risk management system defining risk appetite and monitoring the most significant risks.
The Audit Committee supports the Board of Directors in monitoring the Groups risk exposures and is responsible for reviewing the effectiveness of the risk management system.
The risk register is presented to the Audit Committee following periodic updates by the executive management.
The risk register and framework utilises the Groups risk matrix and universal risk prioritisation and rating scale which grade and prioritise perceived and known risks based on the probability of the adverse event occurring and scale of consequences from a risk occurrence.
The risk register defines a responsible body or individuals who are charged with monitoring managing and mitigating these risks.
Executive management performs the risk identification assessment and mitigation throughout various areas of the Groups business ranging from detailed assessment of environmental risk at the operational level of each mine to the monitoring of delivery risks with respect to each major capital project and the assessment and mitigation of risks at executive management and Board levels through the internal control system and specific risk management actions.
At an operational level all mines identify prioritise and directly engage stakeholder groups that have the potential to affect their operational sustainability or financial performance.
The Groups principal risks are set out below and for the most part are typical of the risks associated with other companies in the gold mining industry.
We consider that in general the Group was affected by the same risks as in prior periods although the precise implications of certain risks may have changed together with our remedial actions.
The Group takes into account known risks but there may be additional risks unknown to the Group and other risks currently believed to be immaterial which could develop into material risks.
Therefore the Groups risks listed below do not represent a complete register of the risks and uncertainties.
Strategic Report Principal Risks and Uncertainties Risk Risk description Mitigation Movement MARKET AND FINANCIAL RISKS
PRICES
The Groups product prices are subject to international supply and demand and can be volatile.
A significant andor prolonged fall in the commodity prices of the metals produced by the Group primarily Au and to a lesser extent Pb Zn and Ag could have an adverse impact on sales and profits.
The Group did not utilise hedging in 2017 and prior periods and price fluctuations had an effect on the Groups profits.
The capability to invest in growth projects is limited during periods of low commodity prices  which may in turn affect future performance.
Furthermore the financial viability of the Groups exploration development projects and production operations is sensitive to price levels and may become questionable in an environment of decreasing prices.
Management may have to reassess the economic model and recognise impairment losses.
The Group constantly monitors price trends and forecasts maintains a costcutting programme checks the viability of exploration and development projects based on the current and projected price levels and if necessary revises specific investment plans and schedules.

RISKS
Adverse economic conditions or uncertainties that affect global and Russian financial markets can give rise to risks which may negatively impact the Groups operations and results.
Please refer to Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details explaining the implications and management of financial risks.
CURRENCY
RISK
Adverse fluctuations in Russian roubleUSD and GBPUSD exchange rates.
The Group collects the majority of revenues in US Dollars and also obtains financing in US Dollars.
The majority of costs are linked to US Dollars although a significant proportion is incurred in Russian roubles.
The Group uses natural hedging and matches revenue and debt denominated in US Dollars and reviews other possible ways to hedge exchange rate fluctuations if appropriate.
The Group did not use currency hedges in 2017 and 2016 nor in prior periods.
CREDIT RISKS Risk of loss related to a counterpartys failure to perform its contractual obligations or transactions in a certain time frame and as a result certain financial assets including assets with high liquidity may be impaired.
The Group places cash in reputable and highly rated financial institutions and constantly monitors the financialeconomic situation.
The Group sells commodities to creditworthy and reliable customers.
INTEREST
RATE RISK Interest rates are affected by geopolitical and macroeconomic events.
An increase in interest rates may adversely affect the Groups financial results and its ability to demonstrate the economic viability of certain assets.
The majority of the Groups loans and borrowings have fixed rates at the date of debt drawdown.
LIQUIDITY
RISK
Failure to accurately forecast manage or maintain sufficient liquidity and credit could impact our ability to operate and result in financial loss.
An event such as a significant operational incident or geopolitical events may potentially increase financing costs and limit access to financing that could put pressure on the Groups liquidity.
The Group uses a shortterm mediumterm cash planning system and longterm cash flow forecasts are prepared in line with strategic planning.
The Groups centralised treasury function ensures that there is sufficient liquidity for daytoday operations at each location and reviews the need to attract additional external financing.
Opportunities to secure loans at appropriate rates are constantly monitored by the Group.

EXPLORATION
ACTIVITIES
The Groups estimates of ore reserves and mineral resources are subject to a number of assumptions and approximations including geological metallurgical and technical factors future commodity prices and production costs.
Fluctuations in any of these variables could result in lower than expected revenues higher costs and lower operating profits and could lead to reductions in estimated reserves and resources.
The Group makes significant investments in exploration activities performed at greenfield sites to develop the business and at brownfield sites to extend the lifeofmines.
For various reasons including geological and economic factors such activities may prove unsuccessful and may not result in an increase in Group resources.

RISKS AND FAILURE TO
PRODUCTION
PLANS
The Groups mining operations are affected by numerous risk factors not wholly within the Groups control including flooding pit slope and rim slide unexpectedunusual geological variations or technical issues extreme weather conditions and natural disasters.
Such factors could adversely affect production volumes and costs or damage electricity supply facilities andor other necessary items of equipment or infrastructure.
Group companies in both openpit and underground operations may encounter unusual geological formations including overly thin ore bodies incidental deterioration in ore quality lower grade and dilution.
Unexpected interruptions in processing and technological characteristics of the ore may result in lower recovery rates than expected.
As a result of these factors endproduct unit costs may turn out to be considerably above budget and this might hinder the implementation of production plans and cause major losses in the form of impairment of various assets and goodwill.
The Group employs inhouse planning experts who specialise in mine engineering and design and are responsible for developing optimal safe and commerciallyviable mine plans.
In turn the inhouse mine plans are reviewed by external consultants and state authorities.
The mine plans include consideration of safe openpit and underground mining operations including smoke warning systems personal protection kits gas masks selfrescue systems etc. equipment.
The Group implemented a number of processes to ensure that production is facilitated by the necessary machinery and equipment and that relevant standby equipment is available.
Regular maintenance is performed by qualified Group employees and contractors to ensure reliable machinery and equipment operations.
Stocks of spare parts are maintained for urgent repairs.
Details of the operational performance of each of the Groups operations are included in the Operations section on pages 11 to 13.
NEW
CONSTRUCTION
PROJECTS
The Group faces challenges in developing major projects particularly in geographically remote locations and in technically challenging areas.
Construction projects require significant resources and should be executed in accordance with planned costs and within defined terms.
Cost overruns and timely execution in projects directly impact the capital productivity and commercial performance of assets across the Group.
Incorrect capital allocation and poor project management may result in a decrease in the profitability of a particular project and affect the Groups results.
The Group initiates new projects mine extensions etc. plans and a review of management resources.
Major projects are subject to external consultants reports and JORC evaluation.
Capital expenditure disciplines and controls are implemented to deliver onbudget performance for construction projects.
Widely recognised project management techniques are employed.
The Group applies a stagegate process to ensure the cash generation potential of future growth projects.
Management and the Board closely monitor the status of new projects costs incurred and project issues.

WORKFORCE
SHORTAGE
The Group experiences intense competition with other companies for the retention and engagement of mining and production staff including geologists engineers production process managers and other mining specialists.
The loss of key personnel or a failure to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a materially adverse effect on the Groups business financial position and operational results.
The Group monitors the labour and salary markets and develops motivation systems to attract qualified personnel and retain key employees.
One of the responsibilities of the Groups Remuneration Committee is to consider and approve remuneration for senior management.
THE GROUP IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE
HEALTH
AND SAFETY LAWS AND
Group companies are subject to various environmental health and safety regulations stipulated by the relevant regulatory agencies.
The Groups operations require various licencespermissions with regard to the use of industrial explosives the operation of flammable explosive and chemically aggressive production facilities and the use of hazardous structures.
Stricter regulations could cause the Group to incur additional costs in order to comply with the new directives.
State environmental agencies supervise and regulate the Groups operations in accordance with applicable laws and regulations regarding the use of such contaminants as cyanidecontaining reagents.
The Group monitors compliance with environmental requirements and incurs costs to achieve compliance but if environmental regulations change Group companies may face heavy fines and waste removal claims which may become a significant burden on the Group and result in demands to cease operational activity.
The absence of a final product would lead to a decrease in profitability.
Inability to deliver appropriate levels of safety and environmental protection may result in loss of life workplace injuries pollution and lead to a stoppage of operations significant fines and a threat to the Groups licence to operate.
The Group is focused on health and safety issues and environmental protection both of which are prioritised.
Safety and environmental policies are based on the applicable legislation.
Changes in legislation are monitored.
The Group purchases the necessary equipment to prevent fires flooding other accidents and pollution.
The Group organises training and assessment programmes for all staff and regularly checks their compliance with HSE rules and regulations.
An external provider of rescue services is contracted in accordance with legislation.
The Group strives to implement international best practices conducts regular internal and external environmental audits and implements remedial actions where required.
In 2014 it completed the certification of all major production sites under ISO 140012004 and in 2017 and 2016 successfully completed ISO 14001 recertification audits.
At Board level the Groups HSE Committee considers and monitors all key HSE risks.
Highland Gold Mining Limited  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT Risk Risk description Mitigation Movement STRATEGIC RISKS AN ADEQUATE RESOURCE BASE NEEDS TO BE
FOR FUTURE OPERATIONS AND REPLACEMENT OF DEPLETED MINES Due to the fact that the life of a mine is limited the Group has to strategically seek to replenish its resource base through the development of organic projects or through MandA activity.
Mine development from exploration to production is a prolonged process.
There can be no guarantee that current or prospective exploration will lead to sustainable production in the future.
The Group undertakes exploration projects to sustain and increase the resource base.
Comprehensive nearmine exploration plans are developed for all sites.
The Group is actively looking for opportunities around its existing operational assets to create competitive advantages through synergies within the Group and with regard to competitors projects.
REGULATORY
CHANGES AND
ACTIONS
Risks related to changes in the political and economic situation and legislative regulation in the Russian Federation and Kyrgyzstan are significant for the Group in that its major operations are located in these jurisdictions.
The Groups operations in these jurisdictions are regulated by numerous laws standards and guides.
The Groups approach is to strive to comply with all applicable laws and regulations.
There is a risk that government and government agencies could perform actions adopt new laws taxes regulations rules or other requirements which could have a negative impact on the Groups business and operations.
Senior management monitors political developments and new legislation and assesses possible implications for the Group.
In addition the Group has established lines of communication with various governmental authorities in order to contribute to the thinking of such bodies and when appropriate to participate in relevant discussions with political and regulatory authorities.
The Group is not directly affected by any sanctions although the macroeconomic situation in Russia could result in limited financing options thereby increasing the cost of capital.
The Group monitors further developments on an ongoing basis.

We focused on this area due to the significance of the carrying value of the assets being assessed the number and size of recent impairments the current economic environment in the Groups operating jurisdictions and because the assessment of the recoverable amount of the Groups Cash Generating Units CGUs involves significant judgements about the future results of the business and the discount rates applied to future cash flow forecasts.
In particular we focused our effort on those CGUs with the largest carrying values those for which an impairment had been recognised in the prior year and those with the lowest headroom.
We have understood managements process for impairment analysis through performing walkthroughs.
We evaluated whether potential indicators of impairment had been assessed by management up to the year end date including commodity prices the market capitalisation of the Group when compared to its net assets foreign exchange movements production and reserve estimates.
We audited the impairment models prepared by management by testing the arithmetical accuracy and integrity of the impairment models and carrying out procedures on the reasonableness and consistency of the key assumptions including the sensitivity of the model to changes in these assumptions.
We assessed the historical accuracy of managements budgets and forecasts and sought appropriate evidence for any anticipated improvements in key assumptions such as production volumes or operating costs.
We corroborated previous forecasts with actual data.
We engaged EY valuation specialists where appropriate to ensure certain specific assumptions applied in the impairment model are reasonable.
Where the impairment analysis was based on estimates of reserves andor resources we reviewed the basis of estimation and assessed the competence and independence of any expert engaged in performing work on the estimates.
We tested the appropriateness of the related disclosures provided in the financial statements.
In particular we tested the completeness of the disclosures regarding those CGUs with material goodwill balances and where a reasonably possible change in certain variables could lead to impairment charges.
We consider managements estimates to be reasonable for the current year with assumptions within an acceptable range.
We concluded that the related disclosures provided in the financial statements are appropriate.

Risk Our response to the risk Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee Going concern The Directors of the Group are required to make a rigorous assessment of whether the Group will remain a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements and assess whether there are any material uncertainties in relation to the going concern basis of preparation.
The Groups net debt at 31 December 2017 is US198 million and at 31 December 2016 is US205 million.
The Group has regular scheduled debt repayments and a number of restrictive covenants over a proportion of its debt.
Management and the Board prepare a cash flow forecast and undertake sensitivity analysis Base and Sensitised cases of the key assumptions to verify that the Group can operate as a going concern for at least 12 months from the date the financial statements are signed.
In the current year the performance of the Group has improved largely as a result of more favourable market conditions therefore we consider that the risk has reduced.
We have tested the quality of management forecasting by comparing cash flow forecasts for prior periods to actual outcomes.
We tested the detailed cash flow forecasts prepared by management assessed the key assumptions used in the model and the sources of funding and verified the conclusions reached by management.
We tested the covenant calculations through reperformance to ensure that the Group has not breached any of its key covenants and is not expected to breach any in the future.
We agreed the sources of liquidity to supporting documents.
We performed sensitivity analysis on the Base and Sensitised cases as part of our assessment as to whether the Group has sufficient cash reserves to meet its forecast expenditures and future debt obligations as well as compliance with its debt covenants.
Based on the audit procedures performed we concur with the conclusion reached by management that there is no material uncertainty in relation to the going concern assumption for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit Tailoring the scope Our assessment of audit risk our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for each entity within the Group.
Taken together this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
We take into account size risk profile the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of Group wide controls changes in the business environment and other factors such as recent Internal audit results when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage of significant accounts in the financial statements we selected 10 components covering Russia Jersey and Kyrgyzstan which represent the principal business units within the Group.
Of the 10 components selected we performed an audit of the complete financial information of three components full scope components which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics.
For the remaining seven components specific scope components we performed audit procedures on specific accounts within that component that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the financial statements either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile.
The extent of our audit work on the specific scope accounts was similar to that for a full scope audit.
The reporting components where we performed audit procedures accounted for 100% 2016 100% of the Groups EBITDA 100% 2016 100% of the Groups Revenue and 95% 2016 95% of the Groups Total assets.
For the current year the full scope components contributed 100% 2016 100% of the Groups EBITDA 100% 2016 100% of the Groups Revenue and 39% 2016 40% of the Groups Total assets.
The specific scope components contributed 56% 2016 55% of the Groups Total assets.
The audit scope of these components may not have included testing of all significant accounts of the component but will have contributed to the coverage of significant tested for the Group.
We also instructed three locations to perform specified procedures over certain aspects of the financial statements as described in the Risk section above.
Highland Gold Mining Limited  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Changes from the prior year Our scope allocation in the current year is consistent with 2016 in terms of coverage of the Group and the number of full and specific scope entities.
Involvement with component teams In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the components by us as the primary audit engagement team or by component auditors from other EY global network firms operating under our instruction.
Audit procedures were performed on the three full scope components by our component teams in Russia.
For the four specific scope components where the work was performed by component auditors we determined the appropriate level of involvement to enable us to determine that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group as a whole.
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits that has been designed to ensure that the each location is subject to an appropriate level of senior team member oversight during key activities.
The nature and extent of these visits were designed relative to the size of the component and the division of the responsibilities between the Group team on the significant risk areas applicable to the component.
During the current years audit cycle visits were undertaken by the primary audit team to the component teams in three locations in Russia.
The primary audit team focused time on the significant risks and judgemental areas of the audit met with local management attended closing meetings and reviewed key working papers.
The primary team interacted regularly with the component teams where appropriate during various stages of the audit reviewed key working papers and were responsible for the scope and direction of the audit activities.
This together with the additional procedures performed at Group level gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the Group financial statements.
Our application of materiality We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in forming our audit opinion.
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that individually or in the aggregate could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements.
Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the Group to be 4.7 million 2016 3.2 million which is 3% 2016 2% of EBITDA.
We believe that EBITDA is the most appropriate measure having taken into consideration what we believe to be the perspectives and expectations of the users of the financial statements in the context of our understanding of the entity and the environment in which it operates.
The increase in our materiality is due to improved Group performance and more stable conditions in comparison to prior periods.
Performance materiality The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level.
It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments together with our assessment of the Groups overall control environment our judgement was that performance materiality was 75% 2016 75% of our planning materiality namely 3.9m 2016 2.4m.
We have set performance materiality at this percentage due to our past experience of the audit that indicates a lower risk of misstatements both corrected and uncorrected.
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality.
The performance materiality set for each component is based on the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component.
In the current year the range of performance materiality allocated to components was 1.6m to 3.2m 2016 1.1m to 2.2m.
Reporting threshold An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of 0.2m 2016 0.2m which is set at 5% of planning materiality as well as differences below that threshold that in our view warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.

Other information The other information comprises the information included in the annual report other than the financial statements and our auditors report thereon.
The directors are responsible for the other information.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements our responsibility is to read the other information and in doing so consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information.
If based on the work we have performed we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Jersey Law 1991 requires us to report to you if in our opinion proper accounting records have not been kept by the company or proper returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us or the financial statements are not in agreement with the companys accounting records and returns or we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of directors As explained more fully in the directors responsibilities statement the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements the directors are responsible for assessing the Groups ability to continue as a going concern disclosing as applicable matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditors report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs UK will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if individually or in the aggregate they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Councils website at httpswww. rc. iteauditorsresponsibilities.
This description forms part of our auditors report.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Corporate information The consolidated financial statements of Highland Gold Mining Limited for the year ended 31 December 2017 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 16 April 2018.
Highland Gold Mining Limited is a public company incorporated and domiciled in Jersey.
The registered office is located at 26 New Street St Helier Jersey JE2 3RA.
Its ordinary shares are traded on the Alternative Investment Market AIM.
The principal activity is building a portfolio of gold mining operations within the Russian Federation and Kyrgyzstan.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for financial instruments carried at fair value through profit or loss and assets and liabilities acquired in business combination that have been measured at fair value.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars which is the parent companys functional and the Groups presentation currency.
All values are rounded to the nearest thousand US000 except when otherwise indicated.
Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements of Highland Gold Mining Limited and all its subsidiaries the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union and the Companies Jersey Law 1991.
Going concern The Directors consider that the Group will continue as a going concern.
In assessing the going concern status the Directors have taken account of the Groups financial position expected future trading performance its borrowings available credit facilities and capital expenditure commitments considerations of the gold price currency exchange rates and other risks facing the Group.
After making appropriate enquiries the Directors consider that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least the next 12 months from the date of signing these consolidated financial statements and that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these consolidated financial statements.
Having examined all reasonably possible scenarios the Group also concluded that no covenants are breached in such scenarios.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Highland Gold Mining Limited and all its subsidiaries as at 31 December each year.
A subsidiary is an entity including an unincorporated entity such as a partnership that is controlled by another entity known as the parent.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition being the date on which the Group obtains control and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.
The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company using consistent accounting policies.
All intragroup balances transactions unrealised gains and losses resulting from intragroup transactions are eliminated in full.
The accounting policies in Note 3 have been applied when preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Summary of significant accounting policies Business combinations and goodwill Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree.
For each business combination the Group elects whether it measures the noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets.
Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in administrative expenses.
When the Group acquires a business it assesses the assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date.
This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability will be recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income.
If the contingent consideration is classified as equity it will not be remeasured.
Subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.
In instances where the contingent consideration does not fall within the scope of IAS 39 it is measured in accordance with the appropriate IFRS.
Highland Gold Mining Limited  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Summary of significant accounting policies continued Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred the amount recognised for noncontrolling interest and the acquisition date fair value of any previously held equity interest in the acquiree over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
If this consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired the difference is recognised in profit or loss.
After initial recognition goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
An impairment loss on goodwill cannot be reversed under any circumstances.
For the purpose of impairment testing goodwill acquired in a business combination is from the acquisition date allocated to each of the Groups cashgenerating units that are expected to benefit from the combination irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
Where goodwill forms part of a cashgenerating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation.
Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cashgenerating unit retained.
Further information is contained in Note 16.
Foreign currency and foreign currency translation The Groups consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars which is also the parent companys functional currency.
Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of foreign currency transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities into the functional currency at yearend official exchange rates are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Nonmonetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date of the initial transaction.
Nonmonetary items measured at a revalued amount in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined.
The principal exchange rates against US dollars that were applied are 31 December 31 December
Closing
Property plant and equipment With the exception of those acquired through business combination on initial acquisition land and buildings plant and equipment are valued at cost being the purchase price and the directly attributable costs of acquisition or construction required to bring the asset to the location and condition necessary for the asset to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
In subsequent periods buildings plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value whilst land is stated at cost less any impairment in value and is not depreciated.
Property plant and equipment acquired through business combinations are stated at their acquisition date fair values on initial recognition.
The net carrying amounts of land buildings plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment either individually or at the cashgenerating unit level when events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
To the extent that these values exceed their recoverable amounts that excess is fully provided against in the financial year in which this is determined.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Highland Gold Mining Limited  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Expenditure on major maintenance or repairs includes the cost of replacement of parts of assets and overhaul costs.
Where an asset or part of an asset is replaced and it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will be available to the Group the expenditure is capitalised and the carrying amount of the item replaced is derecognised.
Similarly overhaul costs associated with major maintenance are capitalised and depreciated over their useful lives where it is probable that future economic benefits will be available and any remaining carrying amounts of the cost of previous overhauls are derecognised.
All other costs including repair and maintenance expenditure are expensed as incurred.
Where an item of property plant and equipment is disposed of it is derecognised and the difference between its carrying value and net sales proceeds is disclosed as a profit or loss on disposal in the statement of comprehensive income.
Any items of property plant or equipment that cease to have future economic benefits expected to arise from their continued use or disposal are derecognised with any gain or loss included in the statement of comprehensive income in the financial year in which the item is derecognised.
Depreciation and depletion Depreciation is provided so as to write off the cost less estimated residual values of buildings plant and equipment based on prices prevailing at the balance date on the following bases Mineral properties are depreciated using a unit of production method based on the depleted estimated proven and probable reserves and a portion of resources expected to be converted into reserves.
Buildings plant and equipment are depreciated using the straightline method based on estimated useful lives.
Where parts of an asset have different useful lives depreciation is calculated on each separate part.
Each item or parts estimated useful life has due regard to both its own physical life limitations and the present assessment of economically recoverable reserves of the mine property at which the item is located and to possible future variations in those assessments.
Estimates of remaining useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually.
Changes in estimates which affect unitofproduction calculations are accounted for prospectively.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure Exploration and evaluation expenditure relates to costs incurred on the exploration and evaluation of potential mineral reserves and includes costs such as exploratory drilling and sample testing and the costs of prefeasibility studies.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure for each area of interest other than that acquired from the purchase of another mining company is carried forward as an asset provided that one of the following conditions is met such costs are expected to be recouped in full through successful development and exploration of the area of interest or alternatively by its sale or exploration and evaluation activities in the area of interest have not yet reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the existence or otherwise of economically recoverable reserves and active and significant operations in relation to the area are continuing or planned for the future.
Exploration and evaluation assets contain a mixture of tangible e. drill holes and intangible assets e. evaluation reports capitalised borrowing costs or capitalised GandA cost of licence.
Purchased exploration and evaluation assets are recognised as assets at their cost of acquisition or at fair value if purchased as part of a business combination.
Exploration and evaluation assets are not depreciated.
General and administrative and overhead costs directly attributable to the exploration and evaluation activities are included in exploration and evaluation assets cost.
The restoration provision cost does not form part of exploration and evaluation assets.
An impairment review is performed either individually or at the cashgenerating unit level when there are indicators that the carrying amount of the assets may exceed their recoverable amounts.
To the extent that this occurs the excess is fully provided against in the financial period in which this is determined.
Exploration assets are reassessed on a regular basis and these costs are carried forward provided that at least one of the conditions outlined above is met.
Expenditure is transferred to mine properties once the work completed to date supports the future development of the property and such development receives appropriate approvals.
Highland Gold Mining Limited  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Summary of significant accounting policies continued Mine development expenditure Capitalised mine development costs include expenditure incurred to develop new ore bodies to define future mineralisation in existing ore bodies to expand the capacity of a mine and to maintain production and also interest and financing costs relating to the construction of mineral property.
The net carrying amounts of mine development costs at each mine property are reviewed for impairment either individually or at the cashgenerating unit level when events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
To the extent that these values exceed their recoverable amounts that excess is fully provided against the statement of comprehensive income in the financial year in which this is determined.
The depreciation on items of properties plant and equipment used in exploration and development activities is recognised as part of the initial cost of the related assets and is treated on a consistent basis with the entitys other exploration and development expenditure.
Mine development expenditure is included in mine assets.
Mine properties Development costs are transferred to the mine properties category when the asset is available for use this is when commercial levels of production are achieved.
The restoration provision cost is capitalised within mine assets.
Mine properties contain a mixture of tangible and intangible assets.
The cost of acquiring mine assets after the start of production is capitalised on the statement of financial position as incurred and included in the mine properties category.
The cost of acquiring rights on mineral reserves and mineral resources including directly attributable expenses is capitalised on the statement of financial position as incurred and included in the mine properties category.
The initial cost of a mine property comprises its construction cost any costs directly attributable to bringing the mining property into operation the initial estimate of the provision for mine closure cost and for qualifying assets borrowing costs.
The net carrying amounts of mine assets and mineral rights are reviewed for impairment either individually or at the cash generating unit level when events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
To the extent that these values exceed their recoverable amounts that excess is fully provided against the statement of comprehensive income in the financial year in which this is determined.
Stripping costs The Group incurs waste removal costs stripping costs during the production phase of surface mining operations.
Further details are disclosed in Note 4.
Construction work in progress Assets in the course of construction are capitalised in the construction work in progress account.
On completion the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category of property plant and equipment.
No depreciation is charged on assets in the construction work in progress account.
These assets are depreciated upon their transfer to the appropriate category of property plant and equipment.
Incidental and nonincidental income During the construction of an asset the Group may earn some income.
Income and related expenses of incidental operations that are not in themselves necessary to bring the asset itself to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management are recognised in profit or loss and included in their respective classifications of income and expenses.
Such incidental income is not offset against the cost of the asset.
Income generated wholly and necessarily as a result of the process of bringing the asset into the location and condition for its intended use is credited to the cost of asset.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Highland Gold Mining Limited  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Fair value measurement The Group measures financial instruments at fair value at each balance sheet date.
Fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed in Note 29.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability or in the absence of a principal market in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the Group.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.
A fair value measurement of a nonfinancial asset takes into account a market participants ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy described as follows based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole Level 1  Quoted unadjusted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2  Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable Level 3  Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by reassessing categorisation based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole at the end of each reporting period.
For the purpose of fair value disclosures the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.
Further information on fair values is described in Note 29.
Impairment
At each reporting date management assesses whether there is any indication of impairment within the categories of property plant and equipment annual impairment test is performed on CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated irrespective of whether any indications exist.
If any such indication exists management estimates the recoverable amount which is determined as the higher of an assets fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.
The carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount and an impairment loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
An impairment loss recognised for an asset other than goodwill in prior years is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets valueinuse or fair value less costs of disposal and if there is an indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist or may have decreased.
Leases
Operating leases Where the Group is a lessee in a lease which does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership from the lessor to the Group the total lease payments are charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straightline basis over the period of the lease.
Highland Gold Mining Limited  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Summary of significant accounting policies continued Finance lease Where the Group is a lessee in a lease which transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group the assets leased are capitalised in property plant and equipment with a corresponding liability at an amount equal to the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments on commencement of the lease.
Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate on the finance balance outstanding.
The corresponding rental obligations net of future finance charges are stated separately as finance lease liabilities.
The interest cost is charged to the statement of comprehensive income over the lease period.
The assets acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of their useful life and the lease term if the Group is not reasonably certain that it will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term.
Financial assets and liabilities Financial instruments classification and recognition Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes party to the contracts that give rise to them.
The Group determines the classification of its financial assets and liabilities at initial recognition which in the case of financial assets existing at the transition date includes designation at that date and where allowed and appropriate reevaluates this designation at each financial year end.
When financial assets and liabilities are recognised initially they are measured at fair value being the transaction price plus in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss directly attributable transaction costs.
Financial assets are classified as either financial assets at fair value through profit or loss loans and receivables heldtomaturity investments or availableforsale financial assets as appropriate.
Where as a result of a change in intention or ability it is no longer appropriate to classify an investment as held to maturity the investment is reclassified into the availableforsale category.
Currently the Group does not have heldtomaturity investments or availableforsale financial assets.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets at initial recognition are designated at fair value through profit and loss.
When a group of financial assets is managed on the basis of its performance this is evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented risk management strategy.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit or loss or available for sale.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired as well as through the amortisation process.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities A financial asset is derecognised where the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired the Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material delay to a third party under a passthrough arrangement or the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and either has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset or has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset but has transferred control of the asset.
Where the Group has transferred its right to receive cash flows from an asset and has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the asset it continues to recognise the financial asset to the extent of its continuing involvement in the asset.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or is cancelled or expires.
Gains on derecognition are recognised within finance revenue and losses within finance costs.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in profit or loss.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Highland Gold Mining Limited  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Inventories
Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined on a weighted average basis.
The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw material direct labour other direct costs and related production overheads based on normal operating capacity but excludes borrowing costs.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the cost of completion and selling expenses.
Inventory items that represent significant parts of property plant and equipment are capitalised as noncurrent assets and are depreciated separately.
An existing part should be derecognised when it is replaced with the book value of the replaced part written down through the depreciation charge.
The inventories are segregated by the following gold in process which is valued at the average total production cost at the relevant stage of production gold on hand which is valued on an average total production cost method ore stockpiles which are valued at the average cost of mining and stockpiling the ore raw materials and consumables including fuel and spare parts materials goods or supplies to be either directly or indirectly consumed in the production process which are valued at weighted average costs.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
A provision for impairment of receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate.
The amount of the provision is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand deposits held at call with banks and other shortterm highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction net of tax from the proceeds.
Any excess of the fair value of consideration received over the par value of shares issued is taken to the share premium account.
Value added tax Gold production and subsequent sales are not subject to output value added tax.
Input VAT is recoverable through cash against income tax and other taxes.
Where input VAT is not recoverable the VAT provision is created on the statement of financial position corresponding with the statement of comprehensive income in a relevant period.
Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value net of transaction costs incurred.
Subsequently borrowings are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use a qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost of the respective asset during the period of time that is required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use.
All other borrowing costs are expensed.
Trade and other payables Trade payables are accrued when the counterparty has performed its obligations under the contract they are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Provisions for liabilities and charges A provision is recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event when it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and when a reliable estimate of the amount can be made.
Highland Gold Mining Limited  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Summary of significant accounting policies continued Environmental protection rehabilitation and closure costs Provision is made for close down restoration and environmental cleanup costs including the dismantling and demolition of infrastructure removal of residual materials and remediation of disturbed areas where there is a legal or constructive obligation to do so in the accounting period in which the environmental disturbance occurs based on the estimated future costs.
Where material the provision is discounted and the unwinding of the discount is shown as a finance cost in the statement of comprehensive income.
At the time of establishing the provision a corresponding asset is capitalised and depreciated on a unit of production basis.
Changes in the measurement of an existing decommissioning restoration and similar liability that result from changes in the estimated timing or amount of the outflow of resources embodying economic benefits required to settle the obligation or a change in the discount rate shall be accounted as follow changes in the liability shall be added to or deducted from the cost of the related asset in the current period the amount deducted from the cost of the asset shall not exceed its carrying amount.
If a decrease in the liability exceeds the carrying amount of the asset the excess shall be recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The provision is reviewed on a semiannual basis for changes in cost estimates or lives of operations.
Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured and when all significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset sold are transferred to the customer.
Gold sales revenue is recognised when the product has been dispatched to the purchaser and is no longer under the physical control of the producer.
At this point the Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control over the product.
Novo as a concentrate producer and seller has contracts where price risk is retained for a specified period after the sale has occurred.
The price payable under the concentrate contract is determined by reference to prices quoted in an organized market LME London Metal Exchange LBMA London Bullion Market Association.
A portion of the provisional invoice is settled within a few days 80%.
The remaining amount 20% plus or minus any adjustment on 100% of the value of the sale for movements in price from the price in the provisional invoice and the final price plus any volume of metals adjustments resulting from the final assay is settled in 4 months after the date of the shipment for Kazzinc and is settled in no more than 3 months after the date of the delivery for Hyosung.
For Kazzinc the title to the commodity passes to the buyer on shipment and for Hyosung the title to the commodity passes to the buyer on delivery to boundary railway station  border of the Russian Federation and the Peoples Republic of China.
Pricing adjustment features that are based on quoted market prices for a date subsequent to the date of shipment or delivery of the commodity represent an embedded derivative financial instrument that requires separation at the date the sale is recognised.
The derivative has a fair value based on the pricing formula set out in the contract which is based on quoted market prices.
Adjustments for prices are calculated using the best estimate.
Adjustments for volumes metal grades in concentrates are based on the available actual test results.
No corrections are made in respect of periods where no final test results are available.
Any adjustments to pricing resulting from the embedded derivative as well as volume adjustments are recognised in revenue from concentrate sales and accounts receivable.
Employee benefits Wages salaries contributions to the Russian Federation state pension and social insurance funds paid annual leave and sick leave bonuses and nonmonetary benefits such as health services are accrued in the year in which the associated services are rendered by the employees of the Group.
Earnings per share Earnings per share is determined by dividing the profit or loss attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of participating shares outstanding during the reporting year.
Dividend distribution Dividends on equity shares are recognised in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Highland Gold Mining Limited  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Income taxes Current tax for each taxable entity in the Group is based on the local taxable income at the local statutory tax rate enacted at the reporting date and includes adjustments to tax payable or recoverable in respect of previous periods.
The income tax charge credit comprises current tax and deferred tax and is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income except to the extent that it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity in which case it is recognised in equity.
Deferred income tax is recognised using the statement of financial position liability method in respect of tax losses carried forward and temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes except as indicated below.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary difference except where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss and in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences carryforward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carryforward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised except where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss and in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
To the extent that an asset not previously recognised fulfils the criteria for recognition a deferred income tax asset is recorded.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset is realised or the liability is settled based on tax rates and tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
New standards interpretations and amendments adopted by the Group In the preparation of consolidated financial statements the Group followed the same accounting policies and methods of computation as compared with those applied in the previous year except for the adoption of new standards and interpretations and revision of the existing standards as of 1 January 2017.
Changes to IFRS The following new standards and amendments became effective as of 1 January 2017 Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows Disclosure Initiative The amendments require entities to provide disclosures about changes in their liabilities arising from financing activities including both changes arising from cash flows and noncash changes such as foreign exchange gains or losses.
The Group has provided the information for both the current and the comparative period in Note 29.
Highland Gold Mining Limited  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Summary of significant accounting policies continued New Standards and Interpretations will be adopted in future periods IFRS 9 Financial Instruments In July 2014 the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments which replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement and all previous versions of IFRS 9.
IFRS 9 brings together all three aspects of the accounting for financial instruments project classification and measurement impairment and hedge accounting.
IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 with early application permitted.
Except for hedge accounting retrospective application is required but providing comparative information is not compulsory.
The Group plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective date and will not restate comparative information.
During 2017 the Group has performed a detailed impact assessment of all three aspects of IFRS 9.
This assessment is based on currently available information and may be subject to changes arising from further reasonable and supportable information being made available to the Group in 2018 when the Group will adopt IFRS 9.
Overall the Group expects no significant impact on its statement of financial position and equity from the adoption of IFRS 9.
However there will be some changes to the classification and measurement of trade receivables relating to provisionally priced sales.
Refer below for further discussion.
The Group does not expect a significant impact on its statement of financial position and equity on applying the classification and measurement requirements of IFRS 9.
However there will be some changes impacting trade receivables relating to provisionally priced sales.
As discussed in more detail below within the discussion on the potential impact of IFRS 15 some of the Groups sales of metal in concentrate contain provisional pricing features.
Currently these provisionally priced sales contain an embedded derivative that is separated from the host contract i. the concentrate receivable for accounting purposes under IAS 39.
Accordingly the embedded derivative which does not qualify for hedge accounting is recognised at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognised in the statement of comprehensive income each period until final settlement and presented as part of Revenue.
On adoption of IFRS 9 the embedded derivative will no longer be separated from the concentrate receivables as the receivables are not expected to give rise to cash flows that represent solely payments of principal and interest.
Instead the receivables will be accounted for as one instrument and measured at fair value through profit or loss with subsequent changes in fair value recognised in the statement of comprehensive income each period until final settlement and presented as part of Revenue.
This means that the quantum of the fair value movement will be different because the current approach only calculates fair value movement based on changes in the relevant commodity price whereas under IFRS 9 the fair value of the receivable will not only include commodity price changes but it will also factor in the impact of credit and interest rates.
Based on a detailed analysis management has concluded that the impact is immaterial.
In addition IFRS 9 changes accounting for loan modifications which the Group may experience from time to time and this requirement will be applied at the time of any future modification.
We do not expect any material impact of the adoption of this requirement.
IFRS 9 requires the Group to record expected credit losses on all of its debt securities loans and trade receivables either on a 12month or lifetime basis.
Management has assessed the impact of the new requirements on the Groups consolidated financial statements.
Our assessment is focused on the different types of financial assets presented in the financial statements Receivables at Novo Kazzinc Hyosung incl.
Cash and deposits and Other receivables.
Having analysed the IFRS requirements contracts terms the existing accounting treatment the credit rating position of debtors and their history of payments  the new expected credit losses ECL impairment requirements will not have a significant impact on shortterm trade receivables issued by Novo towards customers or cash deposits and other receivables.
The Group has neither longerterm receivables contract assets nor debt securities which can be significantly impacted by ECL requirements.
No significant impact is expected.
The Group utilises a nohedge policy.
Therefore there will be no impact of new hedge requirements.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Highland Gold Mining Limited  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014 and amended in April 2016 and establishes a fivestep model to account for revenue arising from contracts with customers.
Under IFRS 15 revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer.
The Group plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective date using the modified retrospective method.
During 2016 the Group performed a preliminary assessment of IFRS 15 which was followed by a more detailed analysis in 2017.
This analysis included identifying the contracts with customers and the performance obligations in the contracts determining the transaction price of variable consideration analysing the allocation of transaction price to separate performance obligations assessing the impact of shipping terms and considering the new presentation and disclosure requirements.
As a result of this analysis the key issues were identified and are set out below.
These are based on the Groups current interpretation of IFRS 15 and may be subject to change as interpretations evolve further.
Provisionally priced sales As noted above some of the Groups sales of metal in concentrate contain provisional pricing features which are currently considered to be embedded derivatives.
Under IAS 18 revenue is recognised at the estimated fair value of the total consideration received or receivable when the concentrate is delivered.
Adjustments for prices are calculated using the best estimate.
Adjustments for volumes metal grades in concentrates are based on the available actual test results.
No corrections are made in respect of periods where no final test results are available.
Any adjustments to pricing resulting from the embedded derivative as well as volume adjustments are recognised in revenue from concentrate sales and accounts receivable.
IFRS 15 will not change the assessment of the impact of these provisional pricing features.
IFRS 15 states that if a contract is partially within the scope of this standard and partially within the scope of another standard an entity will first apply the separation and measurement requirements of the other standards.
Therefore to the extent that provisional pricing features are considered to be within the scope of another standard they will be outside the scope of IFRS 15 and entities will be required to account for these in accordance with IFRS 9.
Any subsequent changes that arise due to differences between initial and final assay will still be considered within the scope of IFRS 15 and will be subject to the constraint on estimates of variable consideration.
Revenue in respect of the host contract will be recognised when control passes to the customer and will be measured at the amount to which the entity expects to be entitled.
When considering the initial assay estimate the Group has considered the requirements of IFRS 15 in relation to the constraint on estimates of variable consideration.
It will only include amounts in the calculation of revenue where it is highly probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur when the uncertainty relating to final assayquality is subsequently resolved i. at the end of the quotation period.
As disclosed above the assay differences are not usually material to the Group hence no change is expected when compared to the current approach.
As explained above in the discussion on the potential impact of IFRS 9 the embedded derivative will no longer be separated from the host contract i. the concentrate receivable.
This is because the existence of the provisional pricing features will mean the concentrate receivable will fail to meet the requirements to be measured at amortised cost.
Instead the entire receivable will be measured at fair value with subsequent movements being recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
The requirement to measure the entire receivable at fair value is different from current practice in that the current embedded derivative represents changes in the commodity price whereas the fair value of the receivable will include the impact of changes in the commodity price interest rate risk and credit risk.
Given the nature of the Groups provisionally priced sales in that they are no more than four months long and are with customers who have a strong credit rating the Group does not expect this change to have a material impact.
With respect to the presentation of amounts arising from such provisionally priced contracts IFRS 15 requires revenue from contracts with customers to be disclosed separately from other types of revenue.
This means that revenue recognised from the initial sale must be separately disclosed in the notes to the financial statements from any revenueincome recognised from subsequent movements in the fair value of the related concentrate receivable.
In 2017 the Group continued testing appropriate systems internal controls policies and procedures necessary to collect and disclose the required information.
Highland Gold Mining Limited  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Summary of significant accounting policies continued IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016 and it replaces IAS 17 Leases IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease SIC15 Operating LeasesIncentives and SIC27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease.
IFRS
16 sets out the principles for the recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of leases and requires lessees to account for all leases under a single onbalance sheet model similar to the accounting for finance leases under IAS 17.
The standard includes two recognition exemptions for lessees  leases of lowvalue assets e. personal computers and shortterm leases i. with a lease term of 12 months or less.
At the commencement date of a lease a lessee will recognise a liability to make lease payments i. the lease liability and an asset representing the right to use the underlying asset during the lease term i. rightofuse asset.
Lessees will be required to separately recognise the interest expense on the lease liability and the depreciation expense on the rightofuse asset.
Lessees will be also required to remeasure the lease liability upon the occurrence of certain events e. term a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine those payments.
The lessee will generally recognise the amount of the remeasurement of the lease liability as an adjustment to the rightofuse asset.
IFRS 16 also requires lessees and lessors to make more extensive disclosures than under IAS 17.
IFRS 16 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
Early application is permitted but not before an entity applies IFRS 15.
A lessee can choose to apply the standard using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach.
The standards transition provisions permit certain reliefs.
In 2017 the Group assembled a project team to begin the process of assessing the impact of the leases standard.
In 2018 the Group will continue to assess the potential effect of IFRS 16 on its consolidated financial statements.
For details relating to lease liabilities refer to Note 26.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying accounting policies The Group makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on managements experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Management also makes certain judgements apart from those involving estimations in the process of applying the accounting policies.
Judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements and estimates that can cause a significant adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year include
Deferred stripping costs The Group accounts for stripping costs incurred during the production stage of its openpit operations on the basis of the relevant production measure calculated for every identified component of every ore body volume of waste to volume of ore extracted.
Production stripping costs are capitalised as part of a noncurrent stripping activity asset if probable future economic benefits associated with the stripping activity will flow to the Group costs can be measured reliably and the Group can identify the component of the ore body for which access has been improved.
During the production phase stripping costs production stripping costs can be incurred both in relation to the production of inventory in that period and the creation of improved access and mining flexibility in relation to ore to be mined in the future.
The former are included as part of the costs of inventory while the latter are capitalised as a stripping activity asset where certain criteria are met.
Significant judgement is required to distinguish between development stripping and production stripping and to distinguish between the production stripping that relates to the extraction of inventory and what relates to the creation of a stripping activity asset.
Once the Group has identified its production stripping for each surface mining operation it identifies the separate components of the ore bodies for each of its mining operations.
An identifiable component is a specific volume of the ore body that is made more accessible by the stripping activity.
Significant judgement is required to identify and define these components and also to determine the expected volumes of waste to be stripped and ore to be mined in each of these components.
These assessments are undertaken for each individual mining operation based on the information available in the mine plan.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Highland Gold Mining Limited  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
The mine plans and therefore the identification of components will vary between mines for a number of reasons.
These include but are not limited to the type of commodity the geological characteristics of the ore body its geographical location andor financial considerations.
Judgement is also required to identify a suitable production measure to be used to allocate production stripping costs between inventory and any stripping activity assets for each component.
The Group considers that the ratio of the expected volume of waste to be stripped for an expected volume of ore to be mined for a specific component of the ore body is the most suitable production measure.
Furthermore judgements and estimates are also used to apply the unitsofproduction method in determining the depreciable lives of the stripping activity assets.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure The application of the Groups accounting policy for exploration and evaluation expenditure requires judgement in determining whether it is likely that the asset will bring economic benefits in the future which may be based on assumptions about future events or circumstances.
Estimates and assumptions made may change if new information becomes available.
If after expenditure is capitalised information becomes available suggesting that the recovery of expenditure is unlikely the amount capitalised is written off in the statement of comprehensive income in the period when the new information becomes available.
Estimations and assumptions Impairment of noncurrent assets Nonfinancial assets including goodwill The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset or CGU may be impaired.
If any indication exists or when annual impairment testing for an asset such as goodwill is required the Group estimates the assets or CGUs recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets or CGUs fair value less costs of disposal FVLCD and its value in use VIU.
Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount the assetCGU is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
Management has assessed its CGUs as being an individual mine which is the lowest level for which cash inflows are largely independent of those of other assets.
In calculating the recoverable amount the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a posttax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the assetCGU.
In determining the recoverable amount recent market transactions where available are taken into account.
If no such transactions can be identified an appropriate valuation model is used which reflects managements judgements relating to the estimates a market participant would use to arrive at a FVLCD valuation.
These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples and other available fair value indicators.
Further details on how FVLCD is calculated are outlined in Note 17.
The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecasts which are prepared separately for each of the Groups CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated based on the lifeofmine plans.
The cash flows are based on estimates of expected future production metal selling prices operating costs capital expenditure and posttax discount rates.
Future changes in these variables may differ from managements estimates and may materially change the recoverable amounts of the CGUs.
Please refer to Note 17 for further details on the significant judgements and estimations made when preparing impairment tests of noncurrent assets including posttax discount rates.
Tax legislation Russian tax currency and customs legislation is subject to varying interpretations.
Please refer to Note 26 for details.
The Group establishes provisions based on reasonable estimates for possible consequences of audits by the tax authorities in the countries in which it operates.
The amounts of such provisions are based on various factors such as experience with previous tax audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the taxable entity and the responsible authority.
Site restoration provision A provision is recognised for expected close down restoration and environmental cleanup costs based on the estimated future costs of such activities.
It is expected that most of these costs will be incurred at the end of life of the operating mine.
Assumptions used to calculate the provision for site restoration were based on the government requirements applicable to sites closure and assumptions regarding the lifeofmine which is assumed to close in 2023 at MNV in 2032 for plant and infrastructure and in 2024 for open pit at BG in 2033 at Novo in 2030 at Klen and in 2036 at Kekura expected site restoration activities removal of waste restoration of mine sites and current prices for similar activities.
Highland Gold Mining Limited  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying accounting policies continued Inventory obsolescence The Groups units perform a detailed analysis of old items of stock and create a specific provision for them once it is determined that the recovery of the items value unlikely.
Then the Group performs a turnover analysis for the remaining items of inventory by aging.
If the Group identifies impairment indicators the obsolescence provision is then recognised at the statement of financial position.
The movement in the obsolescence provision is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Determination of ore reserves and resources The Group estimates its ore reserves and mineral resources in accordance with the rules and requirements of the Russian State Committee for Reserves GKZ as well as in accordance with JORC.
Proven and probable reserves and a portion of resources expected to be converted into reserves as indicated in the detailed lifeofmine plans were used in the units of production calculation for depreciation in 2017 as management believes they represent the most accurate approximation of the reserves.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating ore reserves.
Assumptions that are valid at the time of estimation may change significantly when new information becomes available.
Changes in the forecast prices of commodities exchange rates addition to or reduction of reserves as a result of exploration works production costs or recovery rates may change the economic status of reserves and may ultimately result in the reserves being restated.
Mine development expenditure Mine development costs are upon commencement of production depreciated using a unit of production method based on the estimated proven and probable reserves and a portion of resources expected to be converted into reserves to which they relate or are written off if the property is abandoned.
Mine properties Mine assets and mineral rights are amortised using the unitsofproduction method based on estimated proven and probable reserves and a portion of resources expected to be converted into reserves.
Note 17 contains information on the lifeofmines that is in line with the present assessment of the economically recoverable reserves.
Please refer to the Resources and Reserves section for detailed information on mineral resources and reserves.
Segment information For management purposes the Group is organised into business units based on the nature of their activities and has four reportable segments as follows Gold production Polymetallic concentrate production Development and exploration and
The gold production reportable segment comprises two operating segments namely Mnogovershinnoye MNV and Belaya Gora BG at which level management monitors its results for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and evaluating the effectiveness of its activity.
MNV and BG have been aggregated into one reportable segment as they exhibit similar longterm financial performance and have similar economic characteristics nature of products gold and silver nature of production processes type of customer for their products banks methods used to distribute their products and the nature of the environment both are located in the Khabarovsk region.
The polymetallic concentrate production segment namely Novoshirokinskoye Novo is analysed by management separately due to the fact that the nature of its activities differs from the gold production process.
The development and exploration segment contains entities which hold licenses in the development and exploration stage Kekura Klen Taseevskoye Unkurtash Lubov and related service entities Zabaykalzolotoproyekt ZZP and BSC.
The other segment includes head office management company and other nonoperating companies which have been aggregated to form the reportable segment.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Highland Gold Mining Limited  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Segment performance is evaluated based on EBITDA defined as operating profitloss excluding depreciation and amortisation impairment losses movement in ore stockpiles obsolescence provision movement in raw materials and consumables obsolescence provision result of disposal of a noncore entity and gain on settlement of contingent consideration.
The development and exploration segment is evaluated based on the lifeofmine model in connection with the capital expenditure spent during the reporting period.
The following tables present revenue EBITDA and assets information for the Groups reportable segments.
The segment information is reconciled to the Groups profitloss after tax for the year.
Finance costs finance income income taxes and foreign exchange losses are managed on a group basis and are not allocated to operating segments.
Transfer prices between operating segments are on an arms length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
The accounting policies used by the Group in reporting segments internally are the same as those contained in Note 3 of the financial statements.

Deferred income tax assets 129 Deferred income tax liabilities 107614 114045 Deferred tax liabilities net 107485 114045 No deferred tax benefits are recognised in relation to site restoration provisions and obsolescence provisions.
Restoration expenses are tax deductible when incurred.
However it is not certain that there will be sufficient income towards the end of the mines life against which the restoration expenditure can be offset and therefore future tax relief has not been assumed.
The amount of the deductible temporary differences for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the site restoration provision at 31 December 2017 is US18.7 million 31 December 2016 US17.2 million.
No deferred tax benefit is recognised in relation to the provision for obsolete inventory.
These materials are unlikely to be used for production purposes in the future and therefore future tax relief is not assumed.
The amount of the deductible temporary differences for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the obsolescence provision at 31 December 2017 is US27.8 million 31 December 2016 US15.6 million.
The amount of the deductible temporary differences for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the tax losses at 31 December 2017 is US23.3 million 31 December 2016 US21.7 million.
The nonrecognition of tax losses is due to insufficient expected future income against which these losses could be offset.
Russian tax legislation in respect of treating tax losses was changed in 2016 tax losses generated after 2007 can be utilised with no time limit.
The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries for which deferred tax liability in respect of withholding tax on dividends has not been recognised aggregate to US588.8 million 2016 US486.9 million.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is not probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future.
The total deferred tax liabilities arising from these temporary differences should be between US0 and US88.3 million 2016 US0 and US73.0 million depending on the manner in which the investments are ultimately realised.
Profits arising in the Company for the 2017 and 2016 years of assessment will be subject to Jersey tax at the standard corporate income tax rate of 0%.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued for no consideration on the exercise of share options into ordinary shares.
There is no effect of dilution in 2017 2016 none as the share options expired in 2014.

Management has determined the recoverable amounts in 2017 and 2016 using fair value less costs of disposal FVLCD calculations.
FVLCD is determined at the cashgenerating unit level in this case being the separate gold production and development and exploration assets Taseevskoye Unkurtash and Lubov by discounting the expected cash flows estimated by management over the life of the mine MNV until 2032 31 December 2016 2022 BG  2032 31 December 2016 2026 Novo  2033 31 December 2016 2029 Klen  2030 31 December 2016 2029 Kekura  2036 31 December 2016 2030 Taseevskoye  2029 31 December 2016 2029 Unkurtash  2037 31 December 2016 2037 Lubov  2028 31 December 2016 2028.
Including Blagodatnoe The calculation of the FVLCD is sensitive to the following assumptions Recoverable reserves and resources Production volumes Real discount rates Metal prices Capital expenditure and Operating costs.
Recoverable reserves and resources are based on the proven and probable reserves and a portion of resources expected to be converted into reserves in existence at the end of the year.
Estimated production volumes are based on detailed lifeofmine plans and take into account development plans for the mines approved by management as part of the longterm planning process.
Metal prices are based on management judgement with reference to wellknown analysts forecasts.
Operating costs are based on managements best estimate over the life of the mine.
Discount rates represent the current market assessment of the risks specific to each project taking into consideration the time value of money and individual risks of the underlying assets that have not been incorporated in cash flow estimates.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Highland Gold Mining Limited  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
The table below shows the key assumptions used in the fair value calculation at 31 December 2017 and 2016.
2017 2016 Posttax discount rate for cash flows in the operating gold mining company MNV % 6.75 7.25 Posttax discount rate for cash flows in the operating gold mining company BG % 7.75 8.25 Posttax discount rate for cash flows in the polymetallic mining company Novo % 6.75 7.25 Posttax discount rate for cash flows in the gold mining company being at development stage Klen % 8.75 9.25 Posttax discount rate for cash flows in the gold mining company being at development stage T aseevskoye % 8.75 9.25 Posttax discount rate for cash flows in the gold mining company being at exploration stage Kekura % 8.75 9.25 Posttax discount rate for cash flows in the gold mining company being at exploration stage Unkurtash % 8.75 9.25 Posttax discount rate for cash flows in the gold mining company being at exploration stage Lubov % 8.75 9.25 Gold price US per ounce in year 1 1250 1200 Gold price US per ounce in year 2 and beyond 1270 1250 Silver price US per ounce 17 16 Lead price US per tonne 2000 1800 Zinc price US per tonne 2500 2200 As a result of the recoverable amount analysis performed during the year no impairment losses were recognised in 2017 2016 impairment losses of US22.8 million
Goodwill 12563 Mine assets 1478 Stripping activity assets 645 Buildings 4594 Property plant and equipment 3401 Construction in progress 151 Total impairment losses 22832 An impairment loss was recognised in 2016 in relation to the Belaya Gora project.
The triggers for the impairment loss recognition were primarily the effect of changes to the mine plan which resulted in lower recovery rate and higher future capital expenditure accompanied by higher costs due to a stronger rouble.
As part of the Groups annual impairment assessment it was determined that due to changes in estimates of the mine plan the carrying amount of goodwill mine assets stripping activity assets buildings property plant and equipment and construction in progress exceeded their recoverable amounts.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to Belaya Gora has been reduced to nil via the recognition of an impairment loss of US12.6 million during the year ended 31 December 2016.
US10.2 million was recognised as an impairment loss in respect of other noncurrent assets.
Any increase in the posttax discount rate any decrease in gold prices below US1270 per ounce in 2018 or any increase in operating or capital costs at Belaya Gora Klen and Kekura would result in a further impairment of mine properties and property plant and equipment.
For impairment of property plant and equipment and intangible assets fair value less costs of disposal are determined by discounting the posttax cash flows expected to be generated from future gold production net of selling costs taking into account assumptions that market participants would typically use in estimating fair values.
These estimates are categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
Posttax cash flows are derived from projected production profiles for each asset taking into account forward market commodity prices over the relevant period and where external forward prices are not available the Groups Boardapproved lifeofmine model assumptions are used.
As each asset has different reserve and resource characteristics and contractual terms the posttax cash flows for each asset are calculated using individual economic models which include assumptions around the amount of recoverable reserves production costs lifeofminelicence period and the selling price of the gold produced.

In managements view these possible tax claims will likely not result in a future outflow of resources consequently no provision is required in respect of these matters.
In addition because a number of fiscal periods remain open to review by the tax authorities there is a risk that transactions and interpretations that have not been identified by management or challenged in the past may be challenged by the authorities in the future although this risk significantly diminishes with the passage of time.
It is not practical to determine the amount of any such potential claims or the likelihood of any unfavourable outcome.
Notwithstanding the above risks management believes that its interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate and that the Group has complied with all regulations and paid or accrued all taxes and withholdings that are applicable.
Where the risk of outflow of resources is probable the Group has accrued tax liabilities based on managements best estimate.

Financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups principal financial liabilities comprise bank loans and trade payables.
The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various financial assets such as trade receivables and cash and shortterm deposits which arise directly from its operations.
Gold price risk In 2017 as well as in prior years the Group is exposed to the risk of fluctuations in prevailing market commodity prices on the mix of mineral products it produces.
The Groups policy is to manage these risks through the use of contractbased prices with customers.
The Group continued its no hedge policy in relation to the gold price.
Embedded derivative Novo as a concentrate producer and seller has contracts where price risk is retained for a specified period after the sale has occurred.
For more information please refer to Note 3 Revenue recognition.
Foreign currency risk Taking into account that gold prices are formed in international markets and denominated in US dollars the Group seeks to mitigate the foreign currency risk by raising its debt facilities and most of its trade liabilities denominated in US dollars.
However as a result of investing and operating activities in Russia the Groups statement of financial position can still be affected by movements in the RURUSD exchange rates.
Besides the Group also has transactional currency exposures connected with operations denominated in GBP.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the EUR RUR and GBP exchange rates with all other variables held constant of the Groups profit before tax due to changes in the fair value of monetary assets and liabilities.

Credit risk Maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by carrying amount of financial assets.
Credit risk arises from a debtors inability to make payment of its obligations to the Group as they become due without taking into account the fair value of any guarantee or pledged assets and by noncompliance by counterparties in transactions in cash which is limited to balances deposited in banks and accounts receivable at the reporting dates.
To manage this risk the Group deposits its surplus funds in highly rated financial institutions establishes conservative credit policies and constantly evaluates the conditions of the market in which it conducts its activities.
The Group sells the produced gold to recognised creditworthy banks.
The sold gold is being paid for immediately after the sale.
Therefore there are no trade receivables associated with the gold trade.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Highland Gold Mining Limited  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Liquidity risk The Group monitors its risk of a shortage of funds using a recurring liquidity planning tool.
This tool considers the maturity of both its financial investments and financial assets e. from operations.
The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank overdrafts bank loans finance leases and hire purchase contracts.
Please refer to Note 23 for information on the financial covenants the Group is bound by.

Refer to Note 23 for further details.
Capital management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders please see the Groups dividends policy benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
Capital comprises equity and debt financing.
For information related to equity refer to consolidated statement of changes in equity.
For information on debt financing refer to Note 23.
In order to ensure an appropriate return for shareholders capital invested in the Company management thoroughly evaluates all material projects and potential acquisitions and has them approved by the Board where applicable.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
Exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to longterm debt obligations with floating interest rates.
